"Maybe D+ series could add on to the Star Wars Universe in the same way the EU did, or the MCU shows for the MCU.How great is it that we live in an age where we get movie-level shows like GOT or the Mandalorian, that we can watch from our homes? Hopefully it becomes more standard in the future. I can't wait for Green Lantern on HBO Max, for example.",0,1,0,0

"So thor 1 for me was the only one I disliked the first time I watched it. Like I got no enjoyment out if it. But upon rewatching all the MCU, I gotta say both antman movies are really boring and forgettable as well as iron man 2. Thor benefits from the subsequent thor films, same with Cap 1. But man is antman boring. Like the character, but the plot and villains are really bland",0,1,0,0
