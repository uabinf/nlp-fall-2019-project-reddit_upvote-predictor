That doesn't make any sense.,1
"Nah, his wife called him out on it and he has toned it down ever since.",2
[here ya go](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/e0pfjr/fanmade_long_halloween_inspired_batsuit_by/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf),1
"Bruce doesn't get fooled, he just doesn't follow the correct tracks. A detective is only as good as the evidence they have  Lois was able to find out about Clark by following his trail of jobs. She had an actual trail of evidence that took her to the source. Bruce, on the other hand, is using mostly public security footage to see public appearances of Superman. As great as that is, it doesn't give him as much to work with unless Superman accidentally flies somewhere that reveals he's Clark. If Bruce has a bit more evidence, he'd have figured it out",2
"But again, characters are changed all the time to be adapted to film(even years worth of history), including things as significant as their backstories. Some fans fight these changes and I think they have every right to, and should have the fight to here without being accused of being racist. That said, many go on to be celebrated for what they are- a version of the character in a different type of media.  I don’t expect you have much more to say other than what’s been said. And that’s fine! I feel comfortable with my responses as well.",1
"That’s the thing. The first time WW, Batman and Superman are all on screen together can’t be some borderline R rated movie. It just can’t. If a director can’t make a quality theatrical release of a movie then, especially when they have the budget Snyder had, then they shouldn’t be at the helm",0
"I know, I am Greek too. Never understood why he is so successful and how he convinced JK Simmons to be in his film!!! Not even Thanos could beat him!",1
"Interesting. I always thought it was a gimmick. I’m glad it’s starting fade, even if things like imax and surround sound take its place.",1
Waltz would be great. He can play anything with how versatile he is.  I've always wanted Ralph Fiennes for the role though.,1
"Chinese, Indian, Japanese and Korean are nationalities not races, you went to school?",0
"Love Tyler's score for it a lot. I kind of go back and forth between disliking it and thinking it's better than all of the Silvestri Avengers scores sans Endgame. People tend to trash it over on the Marvel Studios subreddit, but I really think it's the only Avengers score (again, sans Endgame) that was really that cohesive.   Elfman and Williams' themes are both fantastic, but wholly unsuited to the tone of the DCEU. Motifs belong to their own depictions, and you get this weird tonal backlash when paired with the contemporary ones. Granted Justice League did try and do a 180 with the actual tone of the DCEU, it's still strikingly odd. The 89' Batman and the Reeve Superman themes are not selling points, so why go out of your way to shaft things further? Granted, Joss Whedon is the absolute last person that should be handling scores. He was the one who specified Elfman resurrect those themes.",2
"I don’t want him to go. I love his Superman and I know with the right script, he can make things happen. I would absolutely love a Superman story with him, Lois and John. Take the latest Rebirth run.",1
Nothing he said is wrong.,0
I imagine they would have been there in the sequel if things went as planned..😭,3
FUCK. YES. LOVE ME SOME DOCTOR FATE!,1
"Perhaps a bit early yet to say that Joker has ""aged well,"" lol. Although I'm sure it will.   Yes, absolutely, MoS--and BvS in particular--are aging well. BvS is pretty much cemented now as what may be considered a cult classic.   The Wikipedia definition of ""cult film"":  ""A cult film or cult movie, also commonly referred to as a cult classic, is a film that has acquired a cult following. Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate fanbase, an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and audience participation. Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially box office bombs, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, transgressive films shunned by the mainstream. The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art. The term cult film itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies, though cult was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that.""",1
"What joker did at box office is just exceptional , I don't even except the sequel to perform that good",1
"Zazie Beetz, which would make her a double alumnus like Crystal Reed for DC on TV.",1
link please,1
"Shazam fans have no reason to try to defend Shazam's BO gross against attacks from haters. We get a sequel + extended miniverse, so the haters can go eat shit",1
"I feel like you're putting top much head cannon into this. Whedon took the job, yes, but I seriously doubt he did it to disrespect another film maker.  If anything, he likely heard Snyder was off the project because the studio didn'l like the direction, got asked and took the job put before him. He did what he could with the time and budget (which for that kind of movie and scale would have tripped anyone up, IMO) and that's literally it.  Not saying he had zero accountability in what we got, but he's also not the villain here. He's a henchman. WB is the villain. They were the ones who gutted Snyders work, kicked him off the project and used a family tragedy to cover their asses. They're the ones who decided on the shit reshoot schedule and tiny ass budget. They're the ones who foot the bill for and OK'ed the *worst* VFX in movie history. Whedon is basically just a thug they had help. And not a very good thug, at that...",2
"Before Aquaman: ""Aquaman is the lamest DC superhero""  when Aquaman came out: ""I'm the highest grossing DCEU movie!""",1
"I guess you didn't like it, heh! I enjoyed seeing the younger versions. I never read the comic book run that did that it's them being young adults (""Ultimate "" something or other). But I liked the Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B Jordan, Jamie Bell versions. It was something fresh. For me, that is. I liked it.",1
I'll give you a hint: not Terrio.,3
Holy hell. I cannot wait to see Doctor Fate in this.,1
I read the comics. Unless Bendis recently did this he does not at all save cats from trees.,2

He left because his daughter committed suicide you numpty.,1
"I dunno, I’m not a big fan of the big bulky armor her and Arthur were wearing in this movie. I feel like if they used this tiara with the bodysuit from the solo movie it’d be the perfect comic look.",3
"Reeves will be allowed to use the Joker but that more or less kills Leto’s chances of ever playing the character again, not that his stunts on the set of Suicide Squad and during the shooting of Joker didn’t already do that for him.",0
"The more I see clips and photos and art from ""The Snyder Cut"" the more I wonder if he was making one movie or ten.",2
I'm down for the Rogues movie,1
Lee Bermejo supports both the Snyder Cut and the Batawang  **MY MAN**,3
"Gadot’s too. Lying will kill their careers and their public image to the fanbase,",3
I said that on another post a week ago.,1
"Well JL really wasnt a Snyder film. If it was his film that was released, we would be having a different conversation one way or another. And by your logic they wouldn't be excites about him involved afterwards, so you need to have that Snyder Bias take a long walk home. And besides the 1 billion isn't even going to WB all the way since they are only getting 50 percent of it.",0
"Good pick! Just dye her hair red. There are red-headed black people, you know.",1
I mean his race doesn’t really define the character and he’ll probably wear a mask most of the time that he’s on screen but 🤷🏽‍♂️,2
It’s the dc universe. They can find a prison to hold him.,0
"> There is no need for editing. Many of the processes they've worked on from pictures shown by Snyder are only done with picture lock. SO no, editing is finished. >  >   What about the photo of Cavill with unfinished CGI he posted just last week?",0
I use it while lifting and damn does it feels powerful to lift to those epic tunes,1
That’s a necessary theory,1
Michael Ironside pls,1
That’s simply not true but to each their own .,1
I mean in the comics he’s pretty much just a man in armor. Imo the BvS design was too similar to Doomsday as he just looked like a huge spiky monster.,3
"I suppose there could be a loophole about it being his photo that just happens to have the image, or he could be just plain bending the rules a little.  That said, I think at the very least the powers that be are having a serious discussion about it.",3
"Well yeah. They were gonna have a [Kryptonian language](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1709700/we-almost-got-to-see-russell-crowe-speak-kryptonian-in-man-of-steel) but Russell Crowe didn't wanna have to learn nonsense syllables. Personally, I love that extra mile in world-building. That's why Game of Thrones and LotR has resonated so well, because there's actual family trees, world maps, and synthetic languages to go along with the story. I love having a rhyme and reason for things; that's why I love Zack's approach to these mythic characters -- he answers the why, the what, and the how, which is fun for me.",2
"Actually most Snyder fans are avid comics readers, and a lot of Snyder haters are DCAU fans exclusively and don't know anything about the comics themselves. Also, if you think DC is only about hope and heroics, you've barely read any Batman. Or 80s Superman. Or like 70% of DC comics.     Zod was a tragic villain far better than Ares. Zod had protecting Krypton literally in his DNA. He couldn't not try and save Krypton and when that purpose is lost, he goes suicidal. He forces Clark to kill him.     Injustice wasn't going to be in Snyder's arc. Superman would've been brainwashed (Not willfully evil) for like 10% of JL3 in the OG plan, and even that was kabashed before JL started shooting.     Finally, the Elseworlds stories are usually some of the best. Dark Knight Returns, All Star Superman, For Tomorrow, Earth One, Arkham Asylum, etc.     DC isn't about hope. Superman is about hope. And you know what's hopeful to me? Having so much faith in humanity that you can sacrifice yourself for them even if they hate you. Having so much love of humanity and family that you do whatever you can to protect it. Letting a potential threat go because a little girl a nation away needs saving. That's heroism. Not using super laser eyes to rebuild the Wall of China. Not quipping while a space demon is trying to control the world. Not just lifting a heavy rock off the Earth. It's testing your limits to throw a moving bomb into space, it's going across the Earth to stop the world engine, it's sacrificing yourself for the future of humanity. That's heroism, that's hopeful.",0
Just wanted to know who and where it was confirmed that JSA will be in Black Adam?,1
I agree with that and we’ve seen that for about seven movies. I’d like there to be a variety of both which is what I’ve loved about BvS.,1
I'm thinking that first one.,1
Don't want this. Will be same as Will Smith as Deadshot. Too busy for the role,2
It's weird. A few years back the criticism people used was that MoS had too much exposition. Now apparently not enough?,1
And?   Its not about Mark.   Its about shifting things away from how WB wants it. Away from the narrative of needing millions to finish or that it was barely completed.   The more articles speaking the truth the better. No matter who is writing them,3
The Penguin,1
**Literally where does it say that in these movies**,1
"Ah yes, a prison strong enough to contain a yellow sunlight exposed kryptonian on Earth, built before any Kryptonian has ever shown on the planet.",1
Thank you. Move on WB...focus on an interconnected universe if you so desperately want money.,0
Let's hope the trend continues.,3
Good pitch bud!! You should post it,1
He's angry and he's hunting....   Hey variety hide somewhere or u'll be that Russian family which no one likes,3
"On YT you can find an interview MBJ did with Oprah where he's asked about the Superman rumors. He basically says he would prefer to play  Calvin Ellis (Earth-23 Superman) who is black. He seemed very aware of  backlash from comic book purists. I don't think temper tantrums on social media should influence the decision, but perhaps this is the idea he pitched.",1
Literally the lead role.,1
[this](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/05/20/johnny-depp-v-amber-heard-depp-submits-photos-black-eye-scratches/3450310002/) is a summary of what’s been going on between her and Johnny Depp.   TL;DR She accused Johnny Depp of domestic abuse during the #metoo movement and his reputation took a hit in a lot of people’s eyes and lost him roles. He comes out with substantial evidence that she was actually the one abusing him and people close to both of them have corroborated his story. There’s another article that details the people who corroborated his story but I’m in class rn and will post later if I get a chance.,1

"Well she is now. Poison Ivy, Katana, and Catwoman were members at one point. She was bound to join. Every female hero, antihero will join BoP.",1
We definitely will. Never lose hope.,1
Are you for real?!. 75% of that stuff is not only rumour but the same 'rumour' Shat out to us earlier on in the year..,1
"No matter how many more times I watch it, there is always more to garner and take away.",3
Friendly reminder that Wonder Woman and Superman didnt even speak to each other in Justice League. Fucking shame.,3
This is great. Hope you keep adding to this album as more are released OP.,2
"I mean, do we know if this pre-rendered scene in the screen shot is finished?",2
Not at the same time. Not when deep down they want a shared universe with a massive film (you can’t convince me this isn’t their end goal),3
I get that and I’d love what you’re saying. But a considerable percentage of movie-goers don’t read comics but do relate Superman to Christopher Reeve.,0
"What i absolutely hate about WB is that they never say shit about shit. They don’t just straight up tell you what is going on, there is never an official announcement. If we are never going to see the Snyder Cut just say so. If Henry Cavill is completely out just say so. I don’t like being left in the dark. That being said, Henry Cavill NEEDS to be Superman. There is only one man on earth for the job.",1
there's picture of him wearing them as Bruce and Batman,2
>This is a great line but I always had an issue with Lex knowing Batman's identify without any explanation.  It seems everybody knows Batman's identity in this universe. And for some weird reason it's not a big deal!,1
"I will say I agree with you that DC's PR in general is very poor. But I disagree here. From about the middle of 2016 to the end of 2017, there were new films being announced every week it felt like and that made them seem disorganised. But since Walter Hamada took over in January 2018, we barely hear anything official now with regard to new films being announced etc. We know the concrete slate and films that are coming out for the next two years, ending with 'Black Adam' in December 2021. I don't expect them to have 2022 and beyond locked down yet so I think it's fair to have some speculation about the possibilities. And as for what ifs etc., I think you hear just as much speculation and leaks about Marvel from guys like Jeremy Conrad, Charles Murphy and DanielRPK as you do for DC.",1
I agree with you but Chris Pratt isn’t the best example because he intentionally [gained weight](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/chris-pratt-only-got-well-written-roles-after-gaining-weight-a7467006.html)  to get more comedic roles. So he just got back into shape for a role like that.,1
"Who cares?  Like...is that the end goal? To like a movie that makes $1b so you can say “I like a movie that made $1b!” Or so when you’re near death and thinking over the films that made an impact on your life you can think of all those films that hit one billion and how important that is to you?  At the end of the day I only care about films that take chances, try to connect emotionally with the audience on a deeper level, and are willing to explore new directions in the CBM genre. I could give a flying fuck if a film pads some corporate bigwigs’ pockets. And neither should you. This whole “X film broke one billion dollars” fad is some crazy level of brainwashing. It made money so it must be good right? I mean Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom must be a top ten film ever then.",1
It’s exactly that.,2
"You don’t see how having a proven, respected actor with box office draw is a criteria for playing the major protagonist in the entire DC universe? There’s a reason Josh Brolin played Thanos and not some random guy nobody heard of who appeared in one episode of Scubs.",0
Solved,1
Wanting the 5 story arc,1
"Batfleck has fans of his iteration. Battinson only has fans that are excited based on concept, when his film comes out there will new be people who are fans of his batman as well. Pattinson will be more than fine, hes the future of DC films batman, Batfleck is the past (with the possible exception of snyder cut but that's set in the past as well). Also you're counting comments, which is gonna be skewed because so many of the comments of afflecks post as releasethesnydercut  hashtags repeats over and over.",1
But no one in power had the backbone to wait and see the bigger picture.,2
"Yes, the one op mentions on his post.",1
"Not tryin to be rude but you are just going to have to deal with it. No doubt there are people on here that aren’t exactly open to the new direction of the DCEU and have to put up with constant posts about Pattinson, etc.",3
ok.,1
"Not to mention how Wonder Women was treated would have been better (JJ treats his female characters well- Joss is that guy who films up skirt shots, has more glaring 'girly' make up on an Amazon Warrior, boob jokes etc)",1
\*staring contest\*,1
Meehhhh how about no love interest?,1
"Olivia called Campea out on his crap earlier this year too. Campea was so adamant that the Snyder Cut ""doesn't exist...get over it"", and Oliva came out of nowhere with ""John, do us a favor and give it a rest. You're embarrassing yourself.""",3
Steppenwolf has such a stupid face in Justice League. It's laughable and ridiculous.,3
Well he certainly wouldn’t want to play Bruce,1
"You're the boss, boss",2
"At this point I'm starting to think he just looks at his cut of the film, on repeat, daily.    Can't say that I blame him. No matter what it has to be better than the final product we were all force fed by WB",2
Misleading title.  Plus this has already been shared in here.,0
They have Wonder Woman and Suicide Squad but not Justice League? That's really odd,2
I dont get it why some DC or whatever fans are against SC. Its not gonna change the current dynamic of DC universe neither its gonna ruin someone's life. If its good then we will have a good time with it otherwise they will get another opportunity to talk crap about Snyder.Its a win win situation for both.,2
"Did you not read my quote? Lex told Superman not the rooftop. “Ripe fruit his hate. Two years brewing but it did not take much to push him over actually. Little red notes, Big Bang, you let your family die”. Lex did that. And seriously, if you read the notes, it does not make sense for Wally to have written them.   And also, I’m not arguing for this theory of the girl being his daughter. I was just sharing my thoughts on it, going along with what that theory would mean and how it could be true. I’m just talking. Whether the theory is true or not doesn’t really change much of the story, it just possibly adds a new layer.",0
we only got to see Heath as the Joker once....and now people are mad we get to see another great Joker more than once?,2
It's.... 75% why. Seems to be the only thing many people come up with,3
"The real ""rule"" if there is one, is actually murder.  Batman has ""killed"" people in the crosshairs countless times.",1
"Because that was supposed to happen during principal photography but Lennix was busy with his schedule, so Jay didn't have to storyboard the scene because Zack already did it.",3
Ok. Sorry,1
"We can agree to disagree on whether this is good PR or not. But I wasn't saying it was a negative article, my whole point is that this is another speculative article with little concrete information which I think is bad PR because its laying out things that may not come to fruition and continues to make it seem like they are disorganized. I was just saying WB really needs to control what gets put out there and what doesn't. I think it would be better for them if the only thing that really gets out to the public is stuff that is very likely too happen and not a bunch of these articles listing potential possibilities",1
"Yeah, and Ray said the reshoots were minimal and David said Theatrical SS was his cut.  PR man. It's all PR. Until these past few weeks Jason was the only one ballsy enough to publicly criticize WB and praise Zack.",2
"Same situation. Like I said, we're probably not gonna see those characters meet up again anytime soon. If they eventually do they can just X-Men it and ignore/broad strokes the earlier movies. But I don't think the continuity is gonna be a major concern going forward. Hence the ""Pattinson can be young Batman in flashbacks while Ben can still play the REAL Batman!"" stuff probably not happening. Pattinson *is* Batman now.",1
"Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy, Harry Potter's last 4 movies were directed by one director.  When you have a vision, one director is enough.",1
Cuckolding is possibly the most disgusting fetish known to man.,0
It makes a lot of sense.  Nabu the god inside of Dr Fate is an Egyptian Lord of Order. So it fits with Black Adam's background.  Either way I am incredibly hype.,1
That patented Apokoliptian sass,3
"this is what george miller said to indewire   **Are there are two “Fury Road” sequels in the works?**   There are two stories, both involving Mad Max, and also a Furiosa  story. We’re still solving, we’ve got to play out the Warners thing, it  seems to be pretty clear that it’s going to happen.  **How did you get into this legal wrangle with Warner Bros. over “Fury Road”?**  It all started because of the chaos at Warner Bros. and not Kevin  Tsujihara, it was pre all that. He wasn’t the antagonist, because a lot  of people didn’t know what was going on and were not prepared to make a  definitive stand; everybody was running around fearful, it seems,  through three regimes. It was hard to get anyone’s attention, so we went  to litigation.

His second one sucked.,1
It will have the same effect that the Nolan films not starring Keaton did: none.,1
"**GUIDEPOST:** Before anyone defaults to the studio pushing this on the creators, note that Phillips has indicated in several interviews that Phoenix himself entertained ideas for a follow-up in the latter days of shooting due to his accumulated affection for the work they had just done together. Since Phillips and Phoenix have expressed great mutual enjoyment of their on-set creative partnership on *Joker,* well before the film's runaway success, there is no strong case for the decision to develop a sequel being a studio-driven mandate. Whatever the external factors, Phillips and Phoenix both came by the notion honestly. Given Phoenix's previous reluctance to take on this and other high profile CBM roles, as well as his noted aversion to franchise think, this was not a given from the start no matter how obvious a move armchair history will make it out to be.  **NOTE:** [Here](https://youtu.be/7yTD-z6YaVg) is one of the meatier post-release interviews Phillips has given. Obvious spoiler warning. I cannot guarantee this is the one where he says it, but Phillips is on record revealing that he and Phoenix are well aware that the criminal mastermind angle is open to them.",1

"Force political agenda? First of all no one forces anyone to go watch or enjoy something that is bent in any way. Plus diversity is a good thing, casting a wider net for actors is a good thing. Invalidating talent based off of an arbitrary detail that doesn't reflect in the character seems kinda pettt Of anything it's a business move and of youbdint like it then dont watch because diversity and not just casting on race but talent seems to be catching steam and fr good reason",0
What I was referring to was characters receiving a redesign. Neither of the examples you provided did that.,1

"I dream about having some rich executive, in this case Emmerich and once upon a time Tsujihara, sit down in front of a Congressional hearing and read to them their own words: ""*The directing is minimal and it has to adhere to the style and tone and the template that Zack set""* and dare them to explain.",0
He posted some pre-viz shots on Vero and talked about it,2
"I liked his Batman, too. But as I recall he was taking the brunt of the criticism from WB and also not wanting to commit to the upcoming movies (now with Robert Pattinson). He wanted to keep his schedule open for other movies and felt like being Batman was going to be too time consuming.",1
All of you complaining will end up liking Huntress,1
Not at all. He clearly doesn't give that much of a shit about it and there's nothing wrong with that.,1
"My issue with this scene is that he's basically unable to move his eyes because he's in a headlock. I felt like Homelander from The Boys shows how truly deadly having heat vision is, no head movements, it's all with the eyes. Unless the family was actually at end of his eye line and he was looking as far too the side as he could would the headlock make sense but they're right in front of him.",0
Ghostbusters demise was its budget not its revenue. And Ocean 8 was a smash hit what are you talking about? And that’s not even accounting for other success stories like Bridesmaid or Girls Trip. Hell even the first 2 Charlie’s Angels were smash hits. Please do some research before posting.,3

"I also said bribes and assassinations. Also, we don’t know about Wally’s family and friends. He may not have much. In fact having family and friends could arguably make his fall even more confusing since they would probably help him out before he got to that point.  Edit: Also, Bruce is doing his own thing. He didn’t know what was happening with Wally, and once the Capitol exploded, he went into full “fuck Superman” mode instead of taking time to think, cause the whole point of Bruce in this story is that he’s being irrational.",1
"I feel like this movie isn't really going to focus on who the characters really are, it's gonna be like 5 random girls doing random illegal stuff. I hope my mind is changed when I see it but I don't have high hopes for it.",1
"I liked all three. But yeah, BvS moreso it's frustrating tbh to me.",1
"Henry Cavill hasn't got twitter. Also, he did admit that he didn't like the theatrical cut of Justice League in the Men's Health interview, but the man just wants to move on from it. I can't blame him.",3
"It’s not up to Snyder though. I’m sure he’d love for his actual vision to see the light of day. Also, he’s loving the support for now",3
I ddnt say anything about harry potter. Bro are you high,1
Nope. No sheer sense of direction.  Only short sighted plans and profit. No longer term gains.,0
🤣 agree with you,0
>The first *Suicide Squad* was extremely popular  Yeah but I think it kind of left bad taste in people's mind & the gap between the 1st and 2nd movie is 5 years hopefully it'll still make 800m+   I'm also hopeful about BA.. nonetheless 2021 is going to be a Great year for CBM fans,2
Not the first instance of three jokers......,2
Would Shazam vs Black Adam count as Black Adam 2 and Shazam 3?,3
Na bring back Arnie ! WHAT KILLED THE DINOSAURS!!!!! 🦕🦖,1
Theres 3 cartoons from TV here and Leto which is utter shite tho,3
"Pretty much all principal photography was completed and Whedon was brought in during the editing process, so they added a bunch of shit. Steppenwolf was supposed to be far more terrifying and cruel than what we got.",2
I'm aware. I'm saying it felt like yesterday when the project was announced and now we're here.,1
maybe you were too young? no matter. the internet is at your fingertips.,0
I'm cool with my turn being cut honestly. It's such a cliched line (It'd be like someone asking you and what army),1
Honestly.,2
"Ahh High Father, you've aged.",2
"And with you about the harassing part, but just keep in mind that Ezra doesnt have social media (Henry has instagram) and he still supported Zack and the cut in a lot of interviews.  But as you said, this isnt the way.",1
Why not tackle another villain origin?,1
Wasn’t the film we got that was so bad it was depressing though? Lol.,2
I just want to say I like the Arkham origins suit.,1
I agree that you take click bait too seriously.,2
Maybe it'll be a hit for people who enjoyed two previous movies.,1
Yea Zack has made pretty poor casting choices with lesser known actors like momoa and cavill,0
Showing him any superhero movie (and him loving them) would be cool. But you really think its not important for him to know who joker is before watching the movie?,1
"Honestly, I think figuring out batmans identity would be fairly straightforward.  About the time some dude comes at you in a tank-car that connects via blue tooth to his super suit you can pretty much cross off like 90% of any given city, but Gotham in particular has a host of rich like New York City.  There are 112 billionaires in NYC, we can assume this is the level of wealth needed when factoring in not just tech costs, but R&D upgrades and repair costs to anything on that level.  So now you have a pool of less than 150 people. You then rule out those with criminal ties, which for gotham we will say that narrows the pool by about 30% (generous for Gotham honestly).   So lets say that leaves you with 60-80 people.  Of those, who has a large *personal* investment in Gotham.  That narrows it down further.   From there its just surveillance. Who’s walking funny after a report of batman getting into a lot of activity over the week. Who’s missing a lot of meetings? Who’s missing the few times batman is seen outside of gotham?   It might take a bit, but honestly it’s just a waiting game at that point.",3
How do y’all think they’ll incorporate them?,2
"Always said a superman sequel ain't coming out before 2023, nice to see I was right. It's gonna be a long time till another superman movie comes out. Probably long enough to recast...",1
Oh wow   Obviously couldn’t disagree with him more. Jeez I’m glad Whedon isn’t touching Batman again,1
"It’s pretty obvious that that’s what it’s referring to, she’s responding to someone asking if he appears in the first Black Adam film. And her response is that The Rock wants that for a sequel. Not that WB is planning it. I’m just saying if you’re going to respond to something, don’t blur the lines on what’s being said. We have too much wonky telephone game going on with these leaks. It’s probably BS, yeah.",0
"Haha, yeah. He looked like a Saturday morning Didney cartoon villain.",1
>what if Snyder cut turns out just like BvS   How exactly ?,2
RAY FISHER FROM THE TOP ROPE,3
"I was in your boat where I thought it needed to be all literally represented but that’s not that case.  It’s a metaphorical representation of Bruce’s character. Bruce several times is referred to as having fallen, from grace. So he lives in darkness. Metaphorical, moral darkness. (On the bottom)  Then Clark dies and redeems Bruce’s character.   You were close with Bruce does literally coming out from the rubble,  but the important part is that, he literally steps *into* the light. Metaphorically showing that his character is saved. Stepping out from darkness.  It also wraps up part of Clark’s purpose as told by Jor-El.   BvS starts with the dream Bruce has, stumbling through the forest, and falling into the well. As he describes it, he has fallen.   Jor-El: *you will give the people of earth an ideal to strive towards, they will stumble, they will fall*  Bruce’s character is redeemed via Clark’s death, shown by him stepping into the light with Clark. (Now represented on the top, his grace restored, place reclaimed)  Jor-El: *in time they will join in the sun Kal, in time you will help them achieve wonders*  What’s nice is that it can be literally interpreted too in a sense from Clark’s position as now that the painting is flipped, the God’s come from the ground because well that’s where Clark is buried.",3
So does he mean she actually talks to him or in the history lesson maybe?,2
The new Batman version joker looks lit,1
Did Aquaman explain it? I thought they just skipped over it.,1
"Yep, this mainly.",3
"You can’t make a great movie better, so I’m confused OP.",1
*RDJ_eyeroll.jpg*,1
I wouldn't want to fight me neither.,2
"Jesus, that suit is majestic",2
">every Joker in the movies is an academy award nominee or winner, if you only count the ones who have been nominated for or won an academy award  Okay, buddy. Whatever you say.",0
> I still can't see WB execs asking Whedon to specifically include boob jokes and ass shots  have you watched suicide squad?,1
"As much as Superman in JL gets shit on I think we got a peek at the pivot towards that kind of Superman. I could imagine a few of his lines from the final battle with Steppenwolf being said by DCAU Superman. And then the opening scene, which I don't think they got quite right, was a step in the right direction.",1
He didn't claim to see the whole movie. Just a reel of specific scenes that would be used for their toy development.,1
"I get it, don't worry, you don't want to be doing that. I wasn't calling you out. More so pointing out the obvious for others, should anyone misinterpret that.",2
Hopefully it can knock down Aladdin. It has 15 million more to go.,2
Are you OK?,3
"I mean, WB wanted Superman to die in Nic Cages reboot in the 90's. And it would have happened in the first movie.",1
"How would they be confused?  ""Director's Cut/Extended Cut"" is pretty self-explanatory...",1
I called my girlfriend last night and Henry Cavill picked up the phone.,3
Agreed! I actually never saw this exact version until a few days ago on Twitter.,2
"Personally I think there's no one better who understood the fear that Batman gave, and the physicality of the Dark Knight, then Snyder",1
"When Lex first sees Clark and Bruce at the party, he's very excited they are meeting.  To me it seemed he was hinting with his comments to them.",3
I believe in Cavills Superman not zacks,2
"Zod is an awful villain, i do not think you can make a good Superman story without using Luthor as a main character. I struggle to find a good Superman comic that doesn't feature Luthor.  Also Luthor needs to be smart and have a smart plan.  The movie was dead on arrival just because of Zod.",0
"Explanation? Try imagining you had to shorten and change a two parts movie with possibily longer than 5 hours into one movie, even worse it was limited at 2 hours only. And you have only few months to do it.",0
"> Did you not read my quote? Lex told Superman not the rooftop. “Ripe fruit his hate. Two years brewing but it did not take much to push him over actually. Little red notes, Big Bang, you let your family die”. Lex did that. And seriously, if you read the notes, it does not make sense for Wally to have written them.  Dude, you’re either failing miserably to shift goalposts right now or simply are not capable of comprehending and processing the words you read in a conversation.  I don’t mean that to be a dick I’m just being brutally honest.  At no point in time did I ever doubt or deny that Lex was behind the notes.  That is very blatantly in the movie.  I have no idea what gave you the impression that I was doubting this that you felt the need to clarify this so matter of factly.  You keep slowly changing the context of the conversation to try and feel like you’re on to something.  It’s genuinely baffling.  We went from “it’s possible Wallace agreed to lie that his wife left him instead of the truth about her dying because Lex got the African woman to lie” to this, and I have no idea how you pulled it off.  I don’t know if you did it on purpose or by accident but bravo I guess.",1
"I feel like the three biggest omissions would be the versions from *Gotham*, *Batman: The Brave and the Bold*, and *The LEGO Batman Movie*. There are many, many other on-screen versions of the Joker, however, especially in animation. For a fairly comprehensive list, check [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media).",1
Probably Arkham City.,2
I think over the past two years zack has been using his own wealth to complete his own cut. he dose own an effect studio,3
"I can see and respect your opinion on them, but IMO (minus the awful wedding interruption by that garbage Felishitty character), I thought Crisis on Earth-X was MANY times more enjoyable than the Justice League movie...though to be honest that wasn't very hard to do.",3
What about Shang Tsung?,0
I'm still certain it's a done deal and most of this is PR. It's massively cheaper to do something like this to generate interest than build and run a load of traditional marketing. If WB don't want to invest more than just finishing the cut then this is the best way to push it.,2
What's the other movie?,1
Really wanted to see Batfleck vs BaneBjörn,1
"So I guess that Plastic Man,Booster Gold and Blue Beetle will be made through HBO Max and Hopfully will have connections to the movie universe same as Disney Plus shows and MCU.",1
I was thinking of it being a ripple effect with joker inspiring theatrical villains the way Superman inspires the formation of the JL,3
They better do it quick before they have to start digitally de-aging the kids.,1
I think he could pull off the role of Joker.,2
its an interview with Todd Phillips not a scoop,2
Would you... would you _live_ for me?    ---    ^This ^comment ^was ^made ^automatically ^by ^a ^bot ^upon ^the ^mention ^of ^the ^Jared ^Leto ^Joker ^| [^Opt-out] (https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Jared_Leto_Joker),0
That'd be awesome!,1
"That, or the NDA expired.",1
"He would be Calvin Ellis or Val Zod.  NOW ME PERSONALLY  I would love him as Val Zod.  He looks the part for sure.  But if he was going to be in the DCEU I think they should expand with the Dakotaverse.  Give us a Static Movie, and Icon movie.  Shit would be great.  The voice actor for Miles Morales in Into the Spiderverse would be perfect for Static.",0
Of course. I mean The Dark Knight returns Batman was always bulk as F. He was no regular Batman.,3
"Semi-related, but can anyone explain if there is a way to download scores from this site? I'm particularly interested in the Batman Begins expanded score, but I'm not sure how to find a download (from here or elsewhere).",1
My bets on two face. Something atleast ganagster or mob related. Imagine if it's that ventriloquist dude?!. I'd actually watch some psychotic old guy lose his head and have an alternate criminal persona led though a puppet. Actually... Would I?.,2
Wow!! Drax is here too...,1
What does their relative age to Pattinson have to do with anything? It doesn't. I'm just saying I would prefer a much older Joker.,0
"I think people need to remember too that Joker is barely a Joker film, but a film with a Joker skin. The US has some morbid fascination with him, probably stemming from a number of reasons, but these other characters aren’t going to draw the same level of interest. The only reason the MCU is successful with the smaller names is because they promise the films affect the IW storyline (eh...sometimes they do) and they make them into cultural events. People go because they’re interested in the overall story, not just the character they’re seeing in that particular film.  There is no tried and true formula. People swear up and down if MoS was more traditional it’d break a billion, but Shazam was light-hearted, family-oriented, a pretty decent film, and barely broke 300 mil.   Aquaman, to me an inferior film to almost all DCEU releases aside from BvS: TC and Suicide Squad, raked in tons of money. Just metric fucktons.  There’s never going to be an x+y=1billion formula. Nor should that be the end goal. Despite what many in this sub would have you believe.",1
😢 Chris Terrio's original pre-Johns script is something I'd kill to read,3
Yeah it's what I think too,1
Wow bud. That's what I had in mind!,1
"80 pages were definitely not used in the theatrical cut. The actor who fought Batman at the start said Joss was disappointed WB made him cut some of that stuff so I expect there was much more cut. Especially as 80 pages is roughly 80 minutes of screentime.  I'm wouldn't be surprised if they filmed the most of the 80 pages though, because the footage looks like they didn't have any time to light it properly and were just rushing through the work.",2
Your logic is broken,0
"No, he was a DRONE pilot. Superman destroyed the drone.",2
Sherman?,1
no chance,2
Exactly why watchmen is a better reference,1
"I've listened to the MOS score regularly since it came out, can't say that about any other soundtracks, I love it.",3
I mean there were rumours of Hawkman being cast as a middle eastern guy which makes sense if this is set in ancient Africa/Near East,1
"According to Ciaran Hinds, Steppenwolf would have been a grounded character, he said he worked too hard on the movie only to see a different movie in the theaters. Previz footage isn't the final take, more or less the design would have been like this with slight changes and his character would have depth like General Zod, and Lex Luther.",1
You collapsed with this comment.,0
"Where'd you get that quote from? That's not in the article at all. It says he proposed to develop a portfolio of DC characters. Not demanded, and not all of them. And not only villains.",2
I know that neither of them is exactly 20 years old. And preferring an older Joker is literally the *first* thing I said. Like the very first sentence.  Go be a jackass somewhere else.,0
Can't wait for Dwayne Johnson to destroy in Allah's name,0
"Batman Forever and Batman and Robin had Michael Gough as Alfred and Pat Hingle as James Gordon. It IS the same universe as Batman and Batman Returns, just a soft reboot.   Heck, even Burton produced Batman Forever.   Even Jack Nicholson's Joker was intended to appear in a Scarecrow nightmare in the third Schumacher movie.   It doesn't matter if the Schumacher ones were more hated than the Burton ones, the reason they soft rebooted was because Returns was too scary for kids.    You can deny it all you want, but Warner is selling them as the Batman quadrilogy in the same way they sell Nolan's trilogy.   Shared universes and continuities were not the same in the 90s than nowadays.  But even today, we have examples like Edward Norton and Mark Ruffalo's Hulk, whose character is completely different in tone and design, yet they kept William Hurt as General Ross in Civil War.",1
No. It's not dumb. It's on point. He's saying in a coy way he knows the connection between Bruce Wayne and Batman while still being poetic about it,2
There's also the chance he might be Calvin Ellis and not Clark....,0
"My only guess is because this is still in the world where Batman has been in the game for decades, so you would think everyone from Penguin to Zsasz to Black Mask to Ratcatcher would have all tussled with him a few dozen times each. At least to the point where all of his usual bad guys should be in or past their prime already as well.",1
"No, we saw some blood, we didn't see brain splattered against the wall though. 90% of people in Arkham are either dead or permanently brain damaged. Hell, I'll bring up other movies like all the cars Bruce ran over in TDK (There are people who had to die from that), and the fact that Keaton unlike Affleck ENJOYED murder. Keaton smiled while blowing goons up. Affleck at least has remorse and has the ""men are still good"" moment.",1
"Better than the final shit we got, but still, I don't get why they choose Steppenwolf (yeah, to tease Darkseid whatever) and even if they did, why they didn't go with the easier and way better human look of the comics.   Steppenwolf is a supporting character and no threat to the League, even without Superman. I think Brainiac would be better and they could still tease Darkseid.",1
Straight cheesing with that dorky smile. :D   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,2
I mean you could argue the Batman personality showed up after the murders  Also Jeremiah Valeska met an early Batman,0
"""scary monster"" + ""from space"" =/= cosmic horror.",0
Oh... you're one of those guys who would rather have characters race-bent rather than seeing original good characters who are also POC.,3
i thought they were those stretchy watches,1
Nice of you to cut off half the comment. You guys are just as bad as those who take Snyder's words out of context to bash him.,1
"How old are _you_, bro? Literally what response is _this_? It's completely unrelated to what he just said. Are you projecting?",2
naturally. Black Adam versus Billy Batson is likely a solid way for WB to make money,1
HAHAHA wow the Snyder hate is strong.,0
Don't do that....dont give me hope. Dr fate *weeps openly*,0
I mean you could just say from one actor to a different one. Found the Italian descent comment funny.,1
I loved him in Fringe,2
I see a fellow veteran of the Format Wars.,1
Whedon could habe told no. But he accepted. It would be fair and in respect towards a colleague artist not to finish his movie.,0
"I mean, it’s their rights, and even if it’s a messy it would be a mess that they asked for and what Snyder would have wanted. JL on the other hand is an abomination, a Frankenstein’s monster that nobody asked for, like doomsday.",1
"This IS a Zack Snyder sub.   That's all that people talk about on here. ""Snyder posted this! Snyder said this!""  I feel like I follow his personal social media by being on here.",0
Yes to JJ and Henry. No to rebooting It into the Pattinson verse.  Just give us two more great Superman movies with Henry.  No crossovers. No JL setups. Just Superman!,2
"Apparently the original script had him cutting his face into a grin like the Ledger version. I’m glad they didn’t do that, because aside from being more original this scene is simpler and actually scarier than that would have been. Less is more, if you will.",3
THANK YOU!!!  I had exactly same reaction. I enjoyed and defended the movie at first the more time I watch it the more I actually dislike the movie. That movie alone brought on the downfall of DCU. There are just so many problems with it.  I'm excited for the new Batman movie tho,3
"I went into this film with high hopes on the back of the reviews and came out wondering why I'd wasted my money. I'm sure I'm just missing something, because a lot of people liked it, but it did nothing for me.",0
Besides the killing stuff and what not this Batman is too cartoony for my liking.,0
"I fucking hate that honestly, tbh. At least try sticking to some continuity.",0
much better title,1
Unfortunately I never had such level conversations about the details and content of the movie. Was just constantly having to defend it against the other trash civil war. So I wasn't able to discuss these types of things with others.,2
"Her lies got him removed from Pirates of the Caribbean, so no more Captain Jack Sparrow because of her",3
"I get that this sub loves reveals in movies and doesn't want anything ""spoiled,"" but at this point I'd really appreciate if they let us know Joe's Deathstroke would be in the new SS. I don't really have much interest in that movie as it is, but I'd definitely be more curious if he were in it.",1
"No, not 'deep' D E P T H, the story and characters have depth. You're welcome. I don't know anyone who uses deep, as someone who likes Snyder's work.",1
"Original plan of JL movies was to have him join Darkseid after Lois gets killed but y'all still believe the ""he was gonna be optimistic and hopeful!"" lies. I guess that's heroic for some of you?   Child please.  We were never supposed to get a true Superman because the director either straight up dislikes it or doesn't understand it. It was always gonna be depressed Mopeman",2
"The only thing that could make this better is if the penciller somehow found a way to subtly make the words start getting more and more off model. Modern Joker dialogue looks less like letters and more like bugs on the page that happen to take the shape of letters. Here, it switches instantly from normal speech, to insane Joker speech in one panel.",3
Maybe general audience prefers Batman's villains to Shazam,1
Best argument for the Snyder cut I have read,3
"Mark Hughes doesn't say anything other than ""The Snyder Cut exists somewhere and should be released"". There's no scoop here. He quotes nobody new either.",3
"If you are a fan of BvS and MOS, I can understand where you are going, but if you only liked WW, I will easily tell you that you can remove Diana's scenes in the present and you will see that it works as a solo film without connection with other movies, of all Forms in the film Diana's fate is left in the air after Steve's death, it is never mentioned that she moved away from the public (unlike BvS where it was more explicit).",1
Apparently according to the director and producer they couldn’t get Henry as they where filming on location in an actual school - for a small allotted time.,3
I think he just meant *he* didn't quit on us. It's WB that's holding back on making a new movie. Whether it's a recast or not Henry wants us to know this is not on him.,1
"They hired another actor to play the same character. If Reeves movie is in DCEU, it would mean that DCEU Gotham has two Jim Gordons, who both at some point work as police commissioners, probably one after another. That's just stupid.",0
"Love ya Henry, you're a great symbol of hope. Very excited for the Witcher too.",2
"Personally, I think that if the movie had a different third act and wasn't supposed to be a Fantastic Four movie, if, say, it was an independent sequel to Chronicle (like Split was for Unbreakable), it could have been amazing.",2
"WB is so stupid, they need to really start taking control of their own narrative with a spokesperson and wait till they actually have some concrete idea of what they are doing before releasing info like this. We've seen articles like this plenty of times already, half of what they are saying in here probably won't stick in coming years. Shared Universe or not, WB really needs to figure out what they are doing, and then communicate it properly to the public instead of through these speculative think pieces. Good PR is honestly one of the things that makes Marvel so good. They make Marvel pretty interactive with fans and feel like an event, whereas WB is treating these movies like a business endeavor and that doesn't really work anymore with fans",2
Elseworld Lex Luthor story like Joker wont be delling with one-on-one fights with superman where Luthor dons a mech suit.  It would be more of an ideological clash.   Lets reserve the classic Lex Luthor vs Superman rivalry in DCEU.  :),2
Which comic is the comic panel from?,1
Read some comics. You are in dire need of some education.,1
"Oh, absolutely frightened of that scenario. Can’t even close my eyes without trembling. It’s evident that the only reason I’m not taking you seriously is fear, there’s no other reason. :P  Seriously though, I’ll give you points for originality for the “Snyder acolyte”. That’s new.",1
Mate he doesn't know the difference between JSA and JL do you expect him to know watchmen and minutemen,3
"Honestly mate. It was the most dumbest finalé. The fact this movie is number 1 grossing in the world is a joke. One guy here said 'its a nice moment'. Yup, and the rest of the 3hrs and 20mins was not worth it. It had next to no action in as well. Poor show. But, INFINITY WAR. that is the one!!.",0
"Nah Michael Shannon killed it as Zod. It was a good foil to Superman (someone part of his past with his abilities on the other side) and ultimately, he chooses Earth over his parents’ world. Honestly that kind of reminds me of assimilation of culture and living in the US since my parents were both refugees",2
Nicee,1
"In Burton's Superman Lives film he wanted Keaton to speak at Superman's funeral, and Kilmer/Clooney both talk about Superman.  The fan canon was always that Reeves Superman and Burton/Schumacher Batman were in the same universe.  *Iffffff* specifically Keaton is to separated from Kilmer/Clooney, then it's possible that Conroy would be portraying at least ONE of the two options (Keaton or Kilmer/Clooney).",1
Arkham City Harley was the absolute hottest thing that college-me had ever laid eyes on.,1
I mean in 1 ensemble movie lol. It shouldn’t take another 10 more years to see another JL movie.   Sucks to be a DC fan these days bro. It’s hard.,1
Who tf at WB interfered? I just wanna talk..,2
I’m a big fan of the BVS directors cut,3
"Rastaman Joker Vibration. Yeah, positive.",2
"If 80 pages mean 80 minutes, then that's 2/3s of the movie being complete shit, which drags whatever good in it down to being shit.",1
Adam West,3
Snyder wasn't in charge of the whole universe. He only was controlling the 5 part Superman arc. WW and Aquaman were both very much Jenkins' and Wan's movies despite growing from the Snyder arc.,1
Damn they look sexy af,3
After what he did with BvS no thanks. I really liked where he was going with MoS and overall I loved it as a superman film and wouldn't change much save for a few tweaks here and there but BvS felt like a step backwards for me. Atleast for the character. I want a movie celebrating the character not a deconstruction.,3
"Yea, this and Killing Cyborg's father are two terrible decisions imo.",2

"Yeah Wonder Woman definitely I do not see as a buff person. Big Barda, sure. But not Diana  Edit: well somebody replied and said “I guess you don’t know what amazons are,” but it appears their comment was deleted lmao. Anyways, yes, I know what amazons are, and I’m quite quite sure they don’t all have to look buff as all hell. Wonder Woman is a demigod, her powers don’t come from massive muscles",2
There was also this one from awhile ago that was supposed to be at the end of the film.  https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/a3odcv/vero_zack_snyder_shares_a_deleted_scene_of_arthur/,3
Find it interesting that the Superman section doesn't mention Cavill and his involvment. It really feels the way it was written that his time is up unless some big name comes in with a great idea to include Cavill.,3
That lil' spermy.,1
"> But what it also does is make Wally a certain kind of bitter. Because losing your wife is one thing, losing your wife because you lost your legs? That hits your pride, that hits your belief in love.  Dude, what the fuck are you talking about?  Are you saying that Wally is lying about his wife leaving instead of saying she actually died because he thinks the lie will make the media think he’s bitter about his loss of pride?  Because it basically just sounds like you’re defending the creative choice of Snyder and Terrio to have her leave him when that literally isn’t even the discussion.  BvS is nearly 2 years after the day he lost his legs.  So even if your logic was “Lex and Wally decided it sounds better to say she left him” (which makes no sense in the context of Wallys character considering the movie made it clear he didn’t think he was going to die), how could he have possibly known he would even meet Lex to do this?  Did he cover up his wife’s death for two years?  What you’re saying makes absolutely no sense within the plot of the movie.  I don’t even know why I’m entertaining this lol.",2
Black Adam isn’t turning up in a Shazam movie until at least Shazam 3,1
"No one forced Whedon but someone would take the job. The guys experience is exactly what WB was looking for. If Whedon said no maybe they would've gone with other MCU directors, or someone even worse who would pay even *less* attention to details than Whedon did. I truly think Whedon tried his best to get things to fit but I imagine with his time constraints, budget and just being thrown into someone else's movie is fucking jarring as hell.  Also I have to imagine Whedon doesn't give a shit if WB butchers their own movie and pays him to do it, he's basically a contract worker at that point, it's not like his reputation is going to be ruined because WB threw him a bunch of money and said throw a bunch of stupid jokes in there we just want a bonus.  People's anger need to be directed at WB for lying about keeping the vision, not for letting Joss Marvel-ize the movie, which is something that WB seems to so desperately want to do for some god forsaken reason.",1
Imagine The Boys but with actual Justice League members. That's DC Black Label.,1
Heath is my favourite,1
"Well the lightning isn't red, it's dark so it hides the terrible CGI a bit but makes it more dull. It's still better than the red lightning.",2
"He’s always been great at that but unfortunately that doesn’t translate to a good movie. Snyder is all style, no substance. He doesn’t direct character and performance well. He’s also bad at constructing stories.",3
"While I think he’d do a good job, Skarsgård as Joker is right up there with Cranston as Luthor for laziest fancast of all time.",3
Jay Garrick is one of those characters gives that feeling of the golden age of comics. That feeling you get when you look at an Alex Ross portrait of the league. Tom Hanks could help bring that to the character in live action,2
I had no problem with Superman killing Zod but Batman was just ruthless.,2
Totally different cases. No comparison.,0

All we have is S.,3
"Snyder fans didn't get Aquaman to $1 Billion. If that's the case then why  did JL, which has Aquaman and eveyrone on it make almost just half of it at the boxoffice?",1
I don't see Christopher Lambert in there,1
"Most of us don't care how it gets out, and WB trying to save face is A-ok with me for sure.  After all, just about everyone involved in those decisions were fired.  Fired in the way execs get fired, where there are contract extensions but you clean out your office and get the hell off the lot, but we also will give you a production company and a first look deal.",0
"Wrong.  ""You let your family die"" was NOT a check... it was a news clipping that arrived AFTER Lex had planted the bomb on Keefe and staged his apartment to look like the sole bomber responsible.  The CHECKS arrived MONTHLY according to Greg.  So what happens when Keefe fails to get his first check or Greg gets the returned check 1 month into the program?  You don't think Keefe will complain?  Reach out?  Ask why?  You don't think the Fund won't reach back and ask what's up?  Moreover, why in the world is Lex doing this one specific action to one specific guy TWO YEARS before he has plans?  How can he predict that Wally doesn't die in a ditch, get arrested for assault, reform and find love, clean up to get custody or visitation, etc?  There is NO WAY to use JUST the checks to get Wally from accident to Capital Hill with the statue protest in-between.  There's no way to predict that Keefe would use red block letters to protest on Superman's statue or not scream out ""Where's my checks?"" or that Bruce doesn't pop-in to check on the man he personally saved on the BZE.  Lex can't control ANY of these factors.  Lex enters Wally's story exactly when the film shows us he did.  If Keefe sends the checks back ALL of the above is answered. He doesn't inquire because HE's doing it.  The Fund's follow up gets shot down because HE knows WHY he returned the checks.  No prediction is required because Lex isn't insanely trying to fortune tell two years into the future. Keefe's protest is consistent with the checks because HE sent them.  Keefe DOESN'T cry out for his checks at his arrest because HE sent them.  And it doesn't matter if Bruce drops in to check up because there is no two-year patsy plan trying to avoid attention until the bombing... quite the reverse, Keefe WANTS attention, which is exactly the OPPOSITE of what Lex would want two years prior to the bombing.  As for the quote, nothing in the quote has Lex taking PERSONAL responsibility.  You can interpret ""It did not take [me] much to push him"" equally with ""It did not take [circumstances] much to push him""... Lex ONLY takes credit for the LAST note which isn't a check.  I never claimed Superman saved Sage, you seem to misapprehending what I wrote.",1
Yeah. Those three actors could play just about anything. Hugo Weaving in particular could probably literally play any part and be beyond excellent. I want to see him do something like Logan Lucky where he can REALLY show off.,2
Y'all remember that epic chase sequence with the Amazons?  We would have gotten the same thing but with Atlanteans.  :(,3
"I loved the TDK trilogy. But **most** of the fight scenes were absolutely horrible for me and my biggest criticism for the trilogy. It looks like a choreographed dance rather than an actual fight and none of the punches felt impactful (Hell, there's even a guy falling down for no reason in TDK:R). Except for the fight against Bane, that was brutal. Other than that, I disagree with you saying that Snyder goes neck on neck with the TDK trilogy. If Snyder is good at one thing, I guess we can all agree that that is action scenes.",3
"Yeah, because that's the only thing that makes no sense in this universe.",1
"Eddie Redmayne, Daniel Kaluuya, Andrew Garfield, and Dev Patel but we aren’t ready for that conversation",1
"I don't care. They should still remain consistent, even the first movie made it clear something happened that made her go underground. Stay consistent, it's just very cheap when they don't respect their own continuity tbh.",0

What fans demand at this point for Ben’s Batman is irrelevant. It’s best if they just start getting used to Pattinson.,2
"Wow, I'm sorry you take this so personal.   Anyways, check out DC's Black Adam on December 22, 2021 to see the legendary antihero and The Justice Society of America for the first time in the DCEU!

If only there was a Superman actor who recently confirmed that the cape was still on his closet and was represented by the Rock's agent....",1

This is a great line but I always had an issue with Lex knowing Batman's identify without any explanation.,3
"Depth is actually a clear indicator that film has a good narrative and explores it with little plot gaps and a great script.  Saying something 'has heart' is the complete opposite. Referring to something as 'deep' in a movie is what you would consider the ending of ff7.   So no, they're not the same thing, aside the fact they are two completely different words. Maybe you just don't understand Snyder's work yet. Maybe you will when you're older.   Sleep well little prince.",1

I read that in Bale's Batman voice.,0
"It’s most definitely a Superman film. The whole film is the world’s various reaction to the Superman. “Must there be a Superman?”   And Batman is just another person who’s reaction we get to see, and because of what he perceives Superman as and what Superman is doing, is why he decides to do something.   But the whole movie is understanding how people see Superman, and as a result, how Superman sees himself. “You don’t owe this world a thing, Clark.”   The movie is part of the his arc in becoming the Boy Scout Superman we all know, but that can’t happen until he finds his place in this world and understand how others see him. This arc was supposed to end in Justice League, leading up to that scene in the end where he finally accepts himself and we see him do the classic ripping his shirt open scene.   Even the main plot is focused on Lex Luthor’s reaction to the Superman. He plans everything just to spread negativity and hatred towards him and plans to set everyone against him including Batman.",3
"Your opinion, obviously.",0
"the one that edgy is you. next time, read your own comment.",0
"I still am losing my mind. I tried watching Aquaman with 4 other people and everyone else got bored and left. I was the only one to finish it and that was more out of a self challenge than anything. How/why did it make so much money?  I just checked, 71% of its gross was from international markets. I think it being released in China is the only reason it beat out the Batman movies.",0
Release it or move on. This is ridiculous.,0
"Plus, I mean, Whedon completely redid Cyborg's origin. In BvS he was pretty much a stump missing half his head, and in JL he's basically only missing his legs.",2

To me quite the contrary.his look in thor 3 can go toe to toe with Henry Cavill in the witchen.,1
we're literally going to have to start a Go Fund Me for this movie aren't we?,2
Correct me if I’m wrong someone but didn’t joss take this gig so he could make his birds of prey film which isn’t happening now? Which makes it 100x worse,2
"I think there can be balance. I really think you can have a Batman movie with some fantastical elements (even though the dark knight trilogy was touted as this ultra realistic take, Batman begins had a lot of fantasy elements to it) without having him fight against monsters etc.",1
I see it. It doesn’t ACTUALLY look like the Tumbler but they share an aesthetic in that bulky post-modern geometric look. Not everyone likes it but aesthetic is judged subjectively. They welcome this sort of thing in Batman and Minority Report but they reject it in reality. I personally welcome it.,1
"As someone who is a lite fan of the DC universe (only read a handful of comics and shows and movies) it was MoS that got me to like Superman. I never was a fan of Superman even when I was young because he came off as perfect and untouchable. My dad likes that aspect of him because to him he cannot do no wrong.   Thanks to MoS it gave me a new look into supes and got me to give the character another try with the comics and found some that evoked the supes I prefer to see, everyone has their definitive version.   The comics I've read btw were Last Son of Krypton, Kingdom Come, Birthright, American Alien, I'm currently going through All-Star Superman and The Multiversity.   It's rather sad to see characters be gatekept  because they don't align with another's personal taste when you can learn so much from a different POV.",1
Maybe it’ll take the open April 2021 spot? WB did move Tom and Jerry which was originally going release there,3
Oh boy here we go again. We've seen this so many times. If people are this dissatisfied looking back in hindsight maybe they should write fanfic instead. These posts aren't adding anything constructive.,1

">would’ve been neat to see Jason doing some squeaks and clicks under water  In JL, perhaps. But can you imagine doing that for practically a whole film in Aquaman?   No chance Wan would have kept that, and frankly it’s a bit worrisome that Zack didn’t consider that aspect of it. Sure, talking is silly, but the better option of the two for a film that spends a lot of its time underwater.",3

Yup. And Isaacs played him in Under the Red Hood.   They both did a good job.,1

I genuinely hope so .,2
"Ezra is Warner Bros' boy toy, he ain't going anywhere.",1

Fuckin good. I usually like Jody but he’s way too opinionated about this stuff.,1
"Someone who works at the studio, right. I’m sure the individuals that last year spread voices on how “the VFX weren’t done”, “the score is incomplete”, “the fabled cut doesn’t exist” too worked at WB. So did Jay Oliva, Junkie XL and the  JL VFX artists, why is the word of named people now less valid than the nameless sources on this we should absolutely trust..?  I don’t have anything against anonymous resources. I have something against studios that refuse to release statements but instead let nameless sources create narratives in an attempt to shut down a group, which hasn’t worked last year and it won’t magically work now, or he next one.  Also, please stop using words like “mental health” when talking about movies of all things. If this is too mentally stressful for you, you should take a break, drink some water, breathe..",0
What do you get when you cross a one-off project with a billion dollars? You get what you deserve!,2
Thank you! you couldn't have done a better job proving my point,3
That’s fine. I think differently,1
I'd pay to watch the SnyderCut even if it's fully like this. If anyone from WB is reading this I'm letting y'all know there are a lot of people who will want to see the movie the way it is. So literally a win - win for the studio.,3
I’m still not really liking the excessive amounts of yellow on Black Canary’s outfit but Huntresses looks a lot better here compared to in the other promo images. I think it’s the clear visible purple that makes it feel more comic accurate even though it’s not.,1
"The latter was likely a Whedon call and they couldn't recall the merch without spending millions an rushing a ""fixed"" version.",2
"If they present anything, it would be nice if it was just a photo. I'm not expecting a teaser or footage of any sort just yet, but something similar to the first photo of the whole squad from David Ayer's Suicide Squad would be really cool. It would be awesome to see everyone in costume together finally.",2
If you didn't like BvS you will not like the Snyder Cut. I can already tell you this now. The people calling for its release liked BvS.,1
Agreed that would be terrible.,2
I think Ben's batman is the most hard-core I've seen of all the other batman his fight scene in bvs when he was saving Martha is hard hitting like Captain America fight scenes sadly we would never get to see him again or not read something of him likely to reprise his role in a very uncertain justice league Sequel,1
"This is so good. I wasn't visualizing a Batman movie with Falcone in it, nor would I have ever come up with John Turturro for the role, but this is just incredible casting.   I'm a big fan of Reeves' ""cast a bunch of really good actors"" strategy so far.",1
Man you’re behind. The film starts filming in January. Of course it’s casting like crazy right now.,2
Saving it for HBO Max,2
I prefer Selina be the Lions daughter. When in Rome implied a lot of confusing sentiments.,1
Who is joe?,1
"I don't believe u/uberduger was saying that they are equivalent. He is saying that if you examine the idea of someone doing the kind of violence which Batman does in a real world setting would not only seriously injure the people which he takes down, but it's likely that things would get out of hand and he would accidentally kill some of them.",1
He doesn’t quite understand giving Batman another theme when his theme is the correct and only one.,3
Why? That doesn't make any sense. Superman isn't typically a lean guy. He is supposed to be like the original Strongman style. He is SUPERMAN ya know? Strength is one of his most notable features and his body is supposed to be a physical representation of his strength while having a larger then life physique.,0
"If they did something like they did with Armie and the Winklevoss' I could see it working - in my head Bane is at peak athletic condition, the venom pushes him into superhuman strength and durability - and Bjornsson's body type.",0
Deadshot by Michael Mann  Deathstroke by Gareth Evans  The Question by David Fincher   Let's goooooooooooo!!!!,1

"I was manly sad that it ended, I wanted more much more. Exact opposite with TLJ, which I was practically waiting for it to just end.",1
I’m torn because Joker was so good and doesn’t really need a sequel. And let’s be real... Hangover 2 & 3 sucked compared to the 1st one. I just hope he can deliver and give us The Dark Knight of Joker movies!,3
But he was fired.,3
This looks like the ending of JL,1
"Probably not without a re-release or some kind of expansion (expansion seems unlikely tbh, but a rerelease if it gets Oscar noms could push it past that mark. It’ll likely finish around 1.05 -1.065B otherwise).",2

"Spot on.  They're still very much Superman and Batman.  It's just that BvS was a deconstruction of the audience's preconceived notions of both heroes.  The story is about what would make them unravel, and break their moral codes.  At the lowest level (literally, the lowest level of the building) however, they find that their POV overlap more than they thought.",1
"I'm sorry, I don't get all of the love for Snyder. BvS was *awful*. That should have been three movies, not one.

Well then get a new pair because he confirmed he completed the score before he left.,2
Uxas led the invasion in search of the Anti life Equation. Steppenwolf supported him. Uxas blamed the failed invasion on Steppenwolf and didn’t let him return to Apokolips until he completed his mission to secure the Anti Life Equation for Darkseid,2

Did he actually scream that? That sounds really obnoxious to do unless he was the only one in the theater and even then I still find it weird that he was talking out loud,3

"So, Batman being as trained as he is, wouldn't know how to incapacitate people without injuring them fatally and would leave bodies in his wake. Okaaaay.   Sounds very in line with Affleck's Batman but Batman in general? Naah. Just my thoughts on the matter. You do you. 👍",0

"He helped frame the Superman's death scene in BvS. They both agreed that Superman should die at the end of the movie, but needed to frame how it would happen. Nolan played Devil's Advocate against the idea to help Snyder frame it in a way that wouldn't be insulting (Though obviously they didn't anticipate people just hating them for the idea). Ultimately they came up with how it was done, and **Nolan did agree Superman should die. I'm emphasizing this because there are people here who didn't read the full articles about that, only clickbait headlines, and who believe that they actually fought over the idea and that Nolan hated the idea. They use this as a way to create a narrative where Nolan was a victim to Snyder's ""dark depressing ideas"". In other words, people are crazy.**  It's generally known that Nolan (And most auteur directors in general, specifically James Cameron) are big fans of Snyder's unique style. Nolan chose Snyder to do MoS based on Watchmen and helped smooth over some producer snaffoos in BvS and generally seemed to like the movie.",3
what could have been ...,2
Should be working now. Could you try again?,2
">There had been chatter that the entire film would unfold in Arkham Asylum, the high-security prison known to comic book fans for housing super-criminals, but that is not the case, according to insiders. Only a handful of scenes will be set at Arkham. If the movie works, Warner Bros. and DC believe that any of these villains could headline their own spinoff movies. Key cast members in both “The Batman” and “Birds of Prey” have contract options to appear in sequels and standalone films.  >To help find a way to make Superman relevant to modern audiences, studio brass has been polling lots of high-profile talent. There have been discussions with J.J. Abrams, whose company Bad Robot recently signed a massive first-look deal with the studio, and there was a meeting with Michael B. Jordan earlier this year with the “Creed” star pitching Warners on a vision for the character. However, Jordan isn’t ready to commit to taking on the project since filming doesn’t seem likely to happen for several years and he has a full dance card of projects. Insiders think that a new Superman film is unlikely to hit screens before 2023, given that there’s no script and no director attached.  >“Birds of Prey” is also expected to get a similar rating and insiders predict that James Gunn’s upcoming “Suicide Squad” sequel will also be R-rated. In the case of “Birds of Prey,” the film won’t be in the pitch-black, grim vein of “Joker.” Insiders describe the film has a more humorous, spirited, girl gang adventure, albeit not one for younger children. A series of recent reshoots dramatically improved test screening results and the studio is confident “Birds of Prey” will be a hit when it opens in February.  >Beyond embracing the darker undercurrents of the DC canon, the company is also revisiting characters that they believe were ill-served by previous big screen adventures. “Green Lantern Corps” remains a priority despite the fact that 2011’s “Green Lantern” was a high-profile commercial disaster. Johns is delivering a script at the end of the year. The project may be presented to Abrams and Bad Robot to see if the company would be interested in producing the picture. However, Greg Berlanti, another major talent on the Warner lot, is partnering with Johns on a “Green Lantern” television show. There’s speculation that relationship could lead to his involvement in a feature film.  >DC has tapped “It” director Andy Muschietti to oversee the movie and has enlisted Christina Hodson (“Bumblebee”) to write the screenplay — Hodson will finish that assignment that before moving on to write a screenplay for “Batgirl.” Production on “The Flash” won’t be able to start until Miller finishes up work on the next “Fantastic Beasts” film, which means that cameras are unlikely to roll until 2021.  >It is currently looking for a director for “The Trench,” a spinoff about a group of vicious undersea creatures who played a supporting role in “Aquaman.” For the next film centered on Jason Momoa’s king of Atlantis, DC has once again tapped James Wan and is hoping to commence shooting in early 2021.  >DC’s future won’t unfold entirely on the big screen. HBO Max, WarnerMedia’s upcoming streaming service, is currently looking for DC properties that could inspire films that premiere on its platform. It hopes to make DC adventures that have slightly lower budgets, requiring them to rely on up-and-coming actors and not established stars, with a goal of keeping production costs under $65 million.  >Logistically, however, there’s little appetite at the studio for spending the millions of dollars it would require to finish visual effects and editing work on Snyder’s version, particularly as “Justice League” was a commercial disaster. There are currently no plans to release a Snyder version either in theaters or on HBO Max.  >“That’s a pipe dream,” said one knowledgeable insider. “There’s no way it’s ever happening.”",3
RELEASE THE DAMN SNYDER CUT ALREADY!!!,3
300 was incredible,1
I do really like Cavill as Superman though I haven't seen Justice League. I like him as Superman and I like him as an actor. Want to see him stay in the role.,3
"Hawkman, Hawkgirl and Doctor Fate as ancient egyptian heroes, with Fate being still Nabu (the spirit that will be later be in the helmet) cause Teth-Adam and Nabu were buddies at some point in the comics",3
"Reality - JL movies would have had Lois dying at hands of Darkseid and Clark become a soldier for Darkseid  Y'all - It was always gonna be optimistic and good and Donner-esque  Must say, the detachment from reality is astounding! Simply WOW!!!",0
"I actually think that they will spin it that way. And Twitter events were part of it. It will allow them to say, ok we listen to fans and Gal, Ben, etc and we're giving you the Snyder cut.",1
I want a Static movie soo bad :( Sadly I don't think it'll ever happen.,1
Aquaman doesn't even come close to comparing to MOS,2
Probably Max (It makes no sense doing anything else),1
"It didn't replace the entire cast and then ignore the events of Iron Man 1. This is a completely new cast from top to bottom (including replacing the Alfred and Gordon from the early movies, with Gordon going from white to black\*) and will almost certainly not acknowledge BVS or Justice League. In fact, I'd be willing to bet money that it won't. Also gonna bet if Reeves uses the Joker in a sequel, it's not gonna be Leto and he won't have gold teeth or gangsta face tats.  \* And before someone says ""Harvey Dent changed races in the Burton series!,"" those movies at least kept the same Alfred and Gordon actors to provide some vague sense of continuity. This isn't even doing that.",2
That’s fair - I’ll be posting the whole suit without any of the background pieces or filters later to show the colors,1
He better start buttering up Ava if he wants to still be Darkseid.,0
Batfleck's suit perfectly nailed Miller's Batman. From the normal suit to that absolutely beautiful mech suit that was ripped straight off the pages of TDKR,1
"It is definitely really rewatchable, but there are also many writing and storytelling problems.",1
"I mean, Cavill literally said he's still Superman, but sure, if you don't want to believe it's been resolved that's up to you.",2
How the hell did he figure out Bruce is Batman?,2
"I can excuse Greek mythology, flying aliens, people running faster than the speed of light, but I draw the line at people talking underwater, that just doesn't make any sense.",3
“I don’t wanna fight you Slade.”  “I wouldn’t wanna fight me neither.”,3

He is pretty old to play step in live action though,2
"your not desaad, your just some common bitch!",1
I’m still confused about it as well. I wonder how Superman would’ve resurrected.,3
His best work.,1
Probably mostly for time and not wanting too many important characters introduced.,1
"If they decide to do another Justice League eventually, they’ll do Flashpoint first and it’ll reset elements of the timeline/bring in the new Batman.",1
That's good news. I would not lament never having to see those again.,1

"See, there you go agoan with your condescending attitude. I don't need to ""read up on it"" I know how it works. So to say I need to ""read up"" quite frankly is rude and narrow minded. Especially when you think the point is going over my head, when in actuality the point is lost on you my friend.  No representation doesn't make a difference. Empathy does. Connection of human beings. Actual human interactions. THAT'S what makes a difference. Pop culture is great but to say it will psychologically make the difference is not true. Not everyone is going to hold your hand and you have to make the friends you can and be the strongest you can be. No amount of representation will give you that sense of clarity. Only YOU and your strength as a person can do.",1

"To me it sucks because I always believed we would get that superman from Zack, that's what I always assumed the endgame with that character arc was. After that they would do more upbeat superman stories with a more traditional characterization. I know Snyder originally had different plans for JL that were scrapped before production, superman being evil for a bit I believe. Anyway with the whole rebirth I just assumed that would be the launch point for the newer ""brighter"" superman that some wanted and Cavill wanted to play. That's why it's so mind boggling to me what they did to JL. I know they wanted to move on from Snyder, lighten things up, but they still could have done that even if they released the snyder cut originally. I know it they would still have to abandon other story threads with the other characters, but I don't see how that is worse than the monstrosity we got.  I'd like to see Superman use his intelligence in a movie, really show us just how much of a genius he is.",1

"Let me preface by saying I agree they should release the Snyder cut to give us fans of his universe closure, but...  > WB releasing it would show that not only do they listen, but they admit their mistakes.  This is pretty ridiculous.  Justice League was literally a direct result of WB listening, admitting to, and trying to fix their mistakes.  You seem to think WB was the underlying problem here.  They weren’t.  The problem was, whether we agree with them or not, the general audience showed with their wallets that they weren’t fans of Snyder’s DCEU.  They didn’t like Superman in MoS or BvS.  That’s not saying they didn’t like the acting, they didn’t like the character.  They didn’t like Batman in BvS or JL.  Again, no one hated the acting, it was the character again.  Their flagship property was becoming a niche product where small groups of people liked it and everyone else was practically making fun of it.  Do you honestly think a Zack Snyder DCEU would ever have came close to the kind of money Endgame made?  Because WB knows that wasn’t happening, and they knew the value of this property and that it should be making *more* than Avengers.  So while I ultimately agree they should release the Snyder Cut, if the logic WB used to not release it was “we don’t want people to think we’re going back to doing the things with these characters our audience didn’t like”, then while I’d still disagree with them I’d at least understand why they are saying that.",0
"I disagree, but to each his own.",2
They can't let Snyder fans have anything. The worst part of all this is the current lineup of films doesn't contradict Snyder's original plan. If people hadn't complained we would almost be done and they could have their snyder free universe soon as well as the films that did release with the benefit of a flash film already filmed and cyborg and and Affleck Batman film. Superman would have good prospects for a sequel and there would be no division and WB would have made all the more money for it.,2

Hmmm... Flash is my favorite hero (Katana/Zatanna imagery nonwithstanding) and I kinda get why the suit. Have you searched for  Flash statues or cosplay until about 2010? There wasn't all that much to work with before.,1
"You're right that as far as the usual Apokolips bunch goes, there's a limited pool to choose from, if you want to go the standard route where the bad guy just brings an army and invades Earth Avengers/Transformers style. None of the Apokolips crowd make for particularly compelling big screen villains imo, so maybe another route would've been a better bet than the standard alien army invasion play. Maybe something along the lines of Superman/Batman: Apokolips or a scenario where he's in league with Braniac or something and Braniac just comes for the first strike on Earth. I mean the way they set it up in BvS, it could have even been Lex who makes the first face to face with Apokolips happen.   To me, the only way that Step works in this scenario is if he's just a lackey like the Black Order was for Thanos. Having him lead a movie as the main villain is like giving Ebony Maw his own movie in my eyes. He just doesn't have what it takes to be a compelling primary villain and an actual existential threat, which is shown in the movie itself when Superman rolls up and 1v1's him with ease.",1
">Paramount did in and changed the design,  I know they did, and they did it because they listened to the backlash.  but what I'm saying is that WB changed JL under scummy circumstances and to avoid having to own up to the fact that they changed the film behind his back when he had to leave for a family tragedy, they'll just give off some lie that they're listening to fans and that they care about their fans so they're releasing the cut.",2

Perhaps Whedon himself forgot how much mess of a film Age of Ultron is. Haha. He even tried to create cheesy romance between Hulk and Blackwidow which is outright disgusting.,1
"> Except Zack Snyder says Zod was doing a Suicide by cop, so he wanted to die.  Zack Snyder saying it doesn't mean that's how it came across in the movie.  >And Zod says either Superman dies, or he dies.  Which kinda contradicts the idea that he wanted to ""suicide by cop"" doesn't it? Do we go by what the character said or what Zack said?  >If Zod really wanted to live and just kill people to hurt Superman, I don’t think he would have made it a point to say that.  He was taunting him into a fight to the death. Are you really going to argue that Zod wouldn't have killed Superman if he'd gotten the chance to?",0

Go ahead. Keep name calling me. It's great.,1
"Jesus, you realize that the Death of Superman isn't meant to stick right? The whole point of the comic arc was more the development of his character through his Rebirth. Not the death itself. Hell, by Death of Superman there were only 6 years of canon stories (Since Crisis rebooted him). Yes that's twice the time between MoS and BvS, but movies are always more compact than comics.     I guess Bruce passing the mantle to Terry is a misunderstanding as well then.",1

"This exactly. I grew up actually *READING* superman comics in the mid to late 90's and had a real obsession going for the character at one point. Know what I thought of Mos? I fucking LOVE it, because;  1: the casting is beyond perfect, and not just Supes. *all* the characters were cast that well. And yes, even Mr white. The actor's skin color was obviously not comic accurite, but the man plays that character's modern interpritation better than anyone else could ever hope to. But that aside, everyone looks and acts their part perfectly.  2: the plot had actual stakes and pitted Superman against enemies who could have actually taken him out without the ""I win"" button (Kryptonite). The emotional and sentimental ties in the plot were also handled very well IMO.   And I personally love that version of Zodd, because he's a villain through and through, but he has understandable motivation and moral grey areas instead of just being generically evil.  3: Lois Lane is a character who's always seemed to work like this; we're *told* she's smart and independant, yet she's too stupid to tell Clark and Superman are the same person and she needs saving constantly because she's too careless or pig headed. The Mos Lois is actualky *shown* to be smart and independant, only needing saving occasionally (rather than constantly) and usually only when dealing with a superman level problem. And even then, sje holds her own a lot of times. She even figures out who the mystery super human is all on her own, by doing her god damned job. I like this Lois a LOT. The classic idea of her was just annoying and IMO insulting to women.  4: we see that superhuman battles can and will actually cause damage. I mean, even in the comics, Metropolis should have been literally leveled at least 20 times in the past 30 years or so. Yet the next issue is ""everything's spotless again, 2 days later"". Not here though. Superman can only do so much to contaon Zodd, and their battle (his first super human level battle) actually causes a lot of damage. Much more believable and much easier to get caught up in the momment. IMO anyway  5: the score is fucking perfect. And I don't feel like I need to further elaborate on that point.  6: my favorite thing in the whole movie is Clark's character arc. It's not just him being Jesus like everyone likes to pretend. He has a moral fiber to him and is believably developed through the movie. And in the end, he's faced with ending the life of a mass murderer to save a family, and does the *only* thing this character could have ever done. And then we see his agony at having no choice but to do it immediately after. We also see his actual vulnerability right after that, when Lois has to be there for him in his grief. It's perfect. And I seriousky don't care what any poser, MCU swilling idiot thinks about that   For my liking, Mos is one of the best modern super hero movies. Right up there with The Dark Knight and Days of future past. But we don't get 40 quips every 16 seconds, cardboard cutout baddies and meme actors. So people have to invent things to hate about it.",3

"HBO Max launches in May 2020, so Snyder's JL will probably marketed as one of HBO Max's exclusives.  If I can read between the lines as most everyone here already has, there's probably been some negotiation put into place right now for Snyder's version to be ready by then. That'll require editing + any VFX touch-ups to be done now, along with creation of marketing + advertising (which imo will be huge and drive alot of DCEU fans/Snyder fans to sign up).",3

">That's just silly and once again belittling of my opinion. You have to realise that there are people that have other opinions than your own.   I'm well aware you have a different opinion, but the issue is that your option is wrong. You claim that representation doesn't matter and it doesn't change the way people and society see different demographics of people, when it's demonstrably true that it does.   >when you can't accept that you aren't making a difference.   Except representation has and continues to make a difference. You clearly don't understand how media changes the way people think.   >So stop trying to force me to see your point of view when I have said nothing wrong  I'm not forcing you to do anything, I'm just explaining that your opinion is wrong and you should do some genuine research to figure out why.  >And just because you dont like my analogy doesn't mean its inaccurate.   But it is inaccurate, the effect of representation in media is a well documented and robust fact, obviously there are grey areas like with anything, but positive media representation does improve peoples self image as well as interdemographic relationships. Disagreeing with it is like disagreeing that the earth is round.  Understanding a murderers motive but not agreeing with it is hardly the same thing.   >Sorry to point out the flaws in your mindset.  What flaws do I have in my mindset?  >Accept that I dont HAVE to accept everything.  I'm well aware you don't have to accept something, but the effect of media representation isn't something I've just made up, it's a very real and a very well documented phenomenon, which again, you'd know if you had actually done some research.",1
"Mark Hamill (Arkham games) , Jack Nicholson , Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix",1
I’d rather they introduce the JSA towards the end of the movie if this is gonna be a period film set wayyyy back in the past.   Like fuck bro how we gon have the JSA and not the fuckin JLA swagga pat down??,1
"No. Simon wasn't directing anything until Dark Phoenix, and Fox fucked him over there. Dark Phoenix was going to be a two-movie epic. But it was forced to be one two hour movie (THAT sounds familiar doesn't it?). Simon helped write First Class, DOFP, had a much better script for Last Stand before the studio shoehorned in the Cure arc with other writers, etc. Simon had about as much to do with Fant4stic as Nolan had to do with JL. His name's technically there, but he had no real impact.",2

It would have been a special for sure!,2
"If they want to race bend him then yes.i was talking about the race that he is known for.i don’t know if in comics he ever was black,hispanic or somebody of another race.",0
Correct. This is the same man who said that Batman and Superman conversing while in costume was silly...which is why they hardly speak to each other in BvS.,3
Man the people who hang around r/movies have an irrational hate for Snyder. I don’t get it.,2
Doom is garbage in that movie! Why tf does he inexplicably have head exploding powers.,1
"Ngl, when I was watching Titans, I thought Ezai Morales would’ve looked good as Steppenwolf if they made him look comic accurate. But I prefer this design",2
Mind boggling to me that people think this had a bigger effect on Affleck than his personal life falling apart and going to rehab. The changes to the movie were probably so small in his eyes compared to this,3

Don’t lose your head,2
What about the analogy is nonsensical?  Snyder cut only subscribers joining is a relationship doomed to fail.  HBO has no interest in giving them more of what they want.  They literally destroyed the movie in question to show how much they don’t plan on giving more content like it.  They’re literally better off just releasing the thing as it’s own thing for more money.  Making it part of a subscription when the subscription will not be giving them continuous content of it makes no sense.  Look at Netflix for example.  If they sign someone it’s almost always multi picture (ie Adam Sandler).  It’s just logical to operate that way as a subscription service.,0
This is my favorite scene in the movie. The score is amazing here too.,3

"WB isn’t going to go forward from after the Snyder Cut as apposed to Justice League. I  don’t see that happening.I would be interested to hear why you do though.   Honestly, starting a bit more anew could be healthy for the universe, it’s easier for creators to create something cool if they’re not caught up in the lore of a story that’s not only lukewarm in reception, but also left unfinished. Now we have lost Ben as Batman, and are unsure about Superman (Despite Cavils comments : yay!). I think it’s safe to say a lot is messy at the moment.  It’s simpler for you, as a big fan, to understand if a movie were to come out after B v S, if it were to start after a directors cut (that would change a lot) or knowing it connects to the past DC movies in some way, perhaps with some restrictions or changes to the cannon. But WB is looking at far larger audiences- and I can see why they’d be worried audiences would be confused about which stories there were, why there’s new faces in the main roles- I think it’s something WB would tread carefully with to try and make the most palatable decision. It’s easy for us to forget how confusing this all is from the outside looking in, since we are here talking on days like today, to best understand where we are at. Most people aren’t.  Justice League was also bad enough that it went and hurt other parts of the universe. For example, Batman V Superman wasn’t that well received. That’s just the case. But after Justice League I expect more people think they hate or hated BvS, I’m not saying any of this to personally put the idea down, but WB will certainly be thinking about all of these things and Batman v Superman doesn’t have a glowing reputation outside these subs. It’s been years now, would it be easier, in their mind, to pull out and dust off old stories and scripts, to open on scenes that are in one way or another tied into BvS or the far more hated Justice League? They’d be actively asking people to remember that failure, and also likely to rewatch it to get caught up.  My guess is WB desires a clean slate where they can hire some creatives with big chops to make something that works, even if it means putting a bit more of the past to bed and to start anew. Now- none of us can know what they’re thinking truly,  especially because it’s WB we’re talking about. But for the reasons stated above, and many others, I think it would be far easier for them to reset, or at least effectively restart.  Am I excited for this to happen? I’m truly supportive of whatever WB needs to do to make a compelling experience with some great storytelling. I’ll get behind either if they think that’ll give them the best chance to do this well and to do it right.",2
"Haha I could list a dozen that prove you wrong and you could only provide the one that proved you right. So I guess you just have to settle with you petty little victory.

"Really?  You have a brooding Clark wandering around the world, having an existential crisis.  It's kinda hard to blame him, given the messages his father tried to instill in him. Getting chastised for saving a bus full of children because apparently keeping his powers a secret was more important than letting 50 kids die?  The color scheme was matches Clark's mentality by being extremely muted. It was mostly grays and brown, and felt more like it belonged in a Batman movie than a Superman one. Superman is supposed to be colorful and fill people with hope, but everything just felt kinda depressing. It wasn't until the very last scene that you finally get some color, and Supes has that happy-go-lucky, Kansas Farm Boy attitude.",1
There is no confirmation that this movie will be in the 90s. It will likely be a hard Batman reboot set in the present day.,2
"I know this is basically just a baseless rumor, but it's so refreshing for baseless rumors about DC films being about character appearances as opposed to how ""doomed"" the movie is.",1
"> I disagree. I don’t think Zod wanted to die.   Yeah it's that classic ""I mean to do that"" argument. Zod's main goal after Superman destroyed his last hope for Krypton is to destroy his people. At the end of the fight he's just too manic to think straight about what he's doing and how vulnerable he is in that moment.",0
Perhaps he could take on an Injustice League film...,1

"I don't think it's ""bad"" necessarily but it's horrendously goofy",2
Mixed feelings about 'sequel'. It really felt like amazing standalone movie.,1

THE ICE AGE,1
How? Reeves has said that in an interview he was approached by Warner Bros with them saying it isn't apart of the extended universe. All the evidence we have points to it _not_ being in the DCEU. Thinking it is apart of that universe is just denial at this stage.,1
>I dont get why people who hate it need to comment on it.  Because thats what a comment section is for? To comment and give opinions..?,3
"Both the completion of the score and the advanced state of the VFX are more recent revelations. What has been known for over a year is that the film was shot and edited, with most of its major VFX sequences well into production. Those who denied all this completely revealed their existential opposition. If your position was based on the two specifics you cited, you were not one of them.",1

"I've heard the Snyder cut starts from Lois's pov mourning Superman's death, since BvS started with Bruce's pov. I'm looking forward to the opening sequence so much, because Zack always does an epic job with that.",3
"Mixed is Man of Steel, Aquaman wasn’t critically mixed don’t rewrite history to fit your narrative. also every single DC movie has been co financed so I really don’t get the obsession y’all have with pointing it out that Joker was.  Shazam which made $374M is more profitable than BVS and Man of Steel, You’re not making the up point you think you’re making.",2
He produced Titans and Doom Patrol. I have confidence.,3
Good lord are you kidding me with this shit?,1
"If you complain about getting downvotes, you're gonna have a bad time.",2
"Batman killed in the Tim Burton movies by roasting criminals with the afterburner of the Batmobile.  Batman killed in Batman #1, dated 1940.  Batman locked KGBeast in a sewer and left him to die.  Batman has killed in many situations and people choose to forget that as a way to hate BvS.  &#x200B;  Edit: It's also heavily implied that Batman kills the Joker in The Killing Joke. I don't know where you got this ""Batman never killed"" idea haha",3
"Yeah, I know. It was a joke about how the studio exec wouldn’t know that.",2
The thing is Whedon is an acomplished director and it is kind of suprising why he would want to step in into a production and try to redo the whole thing when he was given only a month...,1
He didn't.  His daughter killed herself so Snyder decided to take a step back and WB brought in Whedon to complete the movie.,2
"Ocean's 8 was a hit. So was Hustlers a few months ago. Or Girls Trip. Or the original Charlie's Angels for that matter.   If the film is good, it'll be a hit, girl gang or not. Any genre has both hits and flops.",2
"He's a pretty cool character.  It's kind of like a controversial version of Black Panther if he had the powers of Shazam.  Like not necessarily always evil, but not exactly good either.  He just looks out for his people.  Read up on him if you're interested, he definitely deserves a movie.",3
They really made the birds of prey supporting characters in their own movie....😭😭😭,2
"Ok. So, following your opinnion, if we want to see Superman as a hope figure, we should make him see the destruction he caused. Put a montage where after Zod's death, he goes throught the city helping the people, saving them from the bebris and that. That's the seed for a brighter Superman.",1

LOL. The duality of [Bat]man,2
And you’re using a debunked rumor I never believed in as an argument because...?,2
"That BvS intro was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen on film, especially how perfectly it mirrored MoS's ending but from Bruce's perspective.  The scene where he asks that girl where her mom is and she points up to the wreckage of the building makes my eyes water every single time I see it...just an expertly crafted powerful moment right there.",1
"Maybe not in terms of scenes we know about, but to see that it really was Uxas in the original VFX for this history sequence was new. Or maybe just to me--I had assumed they replaced him with Steppenwolf much earlier in production.",2
I definitely preferred her hair in Justice League at least. It felt far more natural than the super deep red in Aquaman.,2
lol at dave bautista. but what did irons say in support of the snyder cut ? didnt he dislike bvs ?,1
Are you talking about Ben’s Batman overall or Whedon’s for Justice League?,2
"Yes, I am aware. Doesn't seem they're going to do with Leto, though. Considering his footage is going to appear in Birds of Prey, and he's still heavily rumoured to appear in the Harley/Joker film.",1
"Except it wasn't until recently that he started posting actual photos. Not storyboards, scenes with completed VFX and everything. That's what's different.",1

"Exactly and the more we see form the Snyder cut and his version of Batman again, the less relevant that Pattinson becomes. I mean, Ben tweeted just one thing saying release the Snyder cut and it has almost 6 thousand people replying to it.

Lakeith Stanfield as L was one of two good things about the Netflix Death Note.,1
"The UC does make a lot of changes:  https://youtu.be/IslGylvkjPE  The main criticism is that the stuff that was cut was actually important to the plot and the development of the characters. The end result is the film is much less confusing and much more complete.  It’s not that fan service-y scenes were cut, it’s that important scenes were also cut with that",1
The BvS suit is next level I really want to see it in a proper scene,2
Shazam gets rock bottom,1
Guess that squashes everyone’s theories of “the studio is making all the actors support the Snyder cut!”  I hated seeing support for the cut from directors and actors and seeing people in this sub belittle it as a studio play.,1
Yep. I need more of this. Much more of this!,3
Don't worry. God knows.,3
Shit Yeah arkham city is gonna come to life in this movie.,2
"I disagree. Say we got someone like Abrams to  write and direct the reshoots, there's no doubt in my mind the final product would've been better but also visually would've looked much better. For christ sakes Whedon didn't even try to make the look of the film consistent. Zack shot on film and Whedon shot on digital",2

"Almost 10 years of Rock talking trash about Black Adam  and it’s not even out yet and we are talking Black Adam 2.

"Oh okay. I see what do you wanna to get. In my take, Clark would save him form the Tornado, but in the way to get back to the refuge, Jonathan has an heart attack. This shows how Sups,  even with his powers, not always will be able to save everyone.",1
"Lol...Whedon didn't decide anything. WB gave him their directives and he stuck to them. A hired on director doesn't dictate runtime, dude. Come on....",3
We only have casting news so far right? How does that suggests it not being in DCEU? Iron man recasted rhodey and it was still in continuity.  Edit: thanks for the downvote for trying to have a conversation whoever,1
Well I love his suit and the aesthetic I don’t think it would work well in live action,0
This movie just keeps getting better and better,1
Nothing wrong in hoping something!,2
"Honestly, whether it's his TV shows, his movies, his comic books or whatever, I've never enjoyed anything Joss Whedon's dipped his hands into. The guy's a hac whose own ex-wife called him out for abusing his producer powers to force actresses into doing the casting couch to get into his shows/films.",1
"Reshoots yes are usually given a window of time where they say this is when they will be. And JL particularly went over that time. To the tune of 25mill+ over. But that's not to say the idea of reshoots wasn't talked about. It's a known thing.     Their reshoots were having problems from the start. It caused issues with Ezra for fantastic beasts and Henry. But also MI6 being delayed due to Tom breaking his ankle was also a spoke in the wheel of issues. So how to you really plan around that.      Hell Macquarrie was willing to let him shave it, but Paramount stood their ground. So it was just a dick measuring contest with Paramount waving their power for no real purpose other than to stick it to them.     In very rare cases does a actor get recast, let alone a lead one. I'm not saying fully blame paramount, but yeah that was kind of petty of them to do what they did.",0
Ok millennial,1
"Yeah, definitely asking a lot of “tell” here.",1
"This is the paradox isn't it. Even had Arthur been adopted by the Wayne's is their fate a set one? Do they still get murdered and Arthur snaps for this reason, becoming Joker. We've seen in Flashpoint even if the Wayne's live a Batman and Joker still exist.",1
"I bet he knows hes going to be recast but because the next superman is coming out so long from now he'll milk him ""still technically being superman"" for as long as possible - I dont blame him.",2
Her JL suit looked way better than Aquaman.,1
I do too.   I think it's absolutely criminal that negative press ruined a set of superhero films that I was enjoying more than any other superhero saga I'd ever seen onscreen.  I pray that we get to see Zack's conclusion in some form.,3
Deadline is inaccurate many times.,1
Boooooo!,1
Yeah I am looking forward to it too. I really enjoyed his version of Dawn of the Dead.  And hopefully we will also get to see the Snyder Cut of JL one day.,1
"Superman, the Kryptonians and humans came from a common ancestor is what I heard from Zack Snyder in an interview, Snyder explained why they look the same but have different bodies due to millions of years of environmental factors. The genetic codex in MoS is a human skull, but from when is the question, I think Snyder would have expanded on this in his sequels.",0
Well it is Night Owl's outfit   The tactical suit still looks sick,1
Michael B. Jordan in a Superman movie about Val-Zod would be incredible.,0

Hollywood hates gingers.,3
"He posts on Vero because he’s a flagship user of it who benefits in some fashion from doing so, probably in the form of some kickback. His friend owns it. He’s been posting almost exclusively on Vero for a couple of years now. He does occasionally use Twitter but their goal with having him and others use Vero has been to get more users on it.  You’re just coming off as really ignorant of the past couple of years of events, also highly combative for no reason. What is your conspiracy theory with the many, many photos he has released?",1
"Oh, I'm not. That's why I've used facts. But like I said, this will be born out by more facts in the end, so it's moot. And Remind Me Bot has been activated.   Here. We. Go!",1

I did say a bit,1
Waltz would be great. What does everyone think about Bryan Cranston though?,1
"I mean... Maybe? But there's no way that crate guy didn't have a fractured skull and severe internal bleeding at the absolute minimum. My point is that it was gratuitous. In the Arkham games, Bruce just kinda wails on some guys with his bare hands (and some knuckle protectors obviously), but it can all be seen as a means to incapacitate, even with the broken arms and legs.   But in BvS he grapples an entire crate (with God knows how much stuff in it) and throws it at a guy's head. The intention couldn't have been to merely incapacitate and it most probably didn't.",1
Had the same exact thought!,1
Holy mother fucking SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT,2
Hugo can be vandal savage,1
What’s this from?,2
first thing I thought of too lmao,2
Cavill is gone just accept it,1
"For some,  yes I think. The difference is that while he executed the changes the studio and also geoff Johns had them made. D&d were both the writers and directors and story runner I believe it was right?",3
That's a total lie.,0
"Thank you, I am sick of negativity.",0
"I actually wonder if the Troops guarding the mother box were from Xebel. They have the same gold armor as the soldiers here, and it kind of makes sense that Mera would have been leading them, since she is their princess, and she wasn’t married to Orm at the time.",3
"Honestly, it very well could be shit. But I want to see what Snyder’s vision was. Aside from me liking Snyder’s style, it’s awful that he didn’t get to complete what he had envisioned. If i think it’s shit I will be the first to admit it but I do want to see what Snyder had planned",1
"Look. I know releasing an actual black character would be better than ""re-skinning"" a white one but her being black as one of the reasons and no explanation just sounds plain racist.",2
"The trades always have all these “exclusives” for upcoming movies but always seem a little late when movies like Birds of Prey and Black Adam move from Development to pre production. Like  WB has obviously been pushing them forward while others aren’t moving but they always fail to mention them in these articles or have exclusives until casting begins. Watch New Gods be in pre production before any Superman, Flash, or Green Lantern movie is.",1
That’s perfect.,1
Jared is a good Joker.,0
"And he later clarified on Twitter that it was a part of the DCEU but would focus on Batman. Then last year, he reiterated it would be part of the DCEU and would contain a few references to the greater world while keeping the focus on Batman. So all the direct evidence we have confirms it is part of the DCEU. It may not be, but stating definitively that it's not is projecting.",1
"That's a weird person to have seen it.  UNLESS, maybe he was being considered for Kilowog?",2
"You cant really reboot a movie if the actor is unchanged. Changing the actor is kinda important for a reboot. Changing the actor makes it clear that its a reboot. If you dont change the actor, the audience will just think its a sequel",1
Others are bringing up a great example like the live action Sonic getting a redesign.,0
Every time I watch this movie I get goosebumps. This movie may be very divisive but it's still one of my top 5 favourite comic book movies,3
And I wish more Snyder haters understood it’s okay to look at things differently,0
No. It's just a saying.,1
That suit is so badass.,2
The official soundtrack not including lois's theme is such a bizarre omission. It's my favourite theme and it's the one that goes through the most variation in the movie.,2
Who said he was physically there?,1
"Then again, who doesn't?     I'll leave now.",1
"If its a large group of people that actually makes it easier to unravel in my opinion. At that point it’s finding the right person and applying proper leverage. Lex has enough money and sociopathic tendencies to bribe or torture or chemically induce the truth.  I think you can rule out criminal ties when you take into account the sheer volume of criminals, again if he were funded by a specific crime group that makes him easier to find, and criminals are even easier to buy.  This is also adding the fact as was pointed out elsewhere Lex has had 20 years of intel gathering.",1
It became really apparent this was not Zack's film anymore when Joss fired Junkie XL and hired Danny Elfman who previously did the Avengers score.,3
Affleck was also suffering from substance abuse. The stress of worrying about the franchise’s future wasn’t helping either.,2
Ok but why take the effort to customize the watches so they would be big enough to fit around your bicep? And then actually wear it?,3
"The article of this post and Shazam’s director himself have already stated that Henry couldn’t be in Shazam due to scheduling conflicts between the time constraints for shooting scenes in the school and him doing Fallout.   Before this we didn’t know anything about his situation, and he didn’t not say anything about WB. How can you read all of this as “nothing changed” is beyond me. Don’t be a grumpybear for the sake of being one, It’s not worth it.",1
"Holy Shit, I never noticed that",1
Beautiful. That's the Superman I love.,1
I think he’s the perfect man to relaunch Superman and maybe the Justice League.,3
Man!!! Jeff Bridges has an amazing voice and would do a phenomenal job. He’s a great actor worthy of Darkseid!   I’m all in on this!,2
"Serious question. As a Superman fan and apologist and Snyder fan. I loved 300, I loved Dawn of the Dead remake, I loved Watchmen, I loved Man of Steel. I thought BvS was okay at best. I hated Justice League. Do we really think this cut is going to be any good?",0
"But I think you CAN blame Whedon just on a general ethics level.  Maybe more so from a “fellow creative person” level.   And this is aside from whatever anger as a Snyder/DCEU fan I have over the end product.    I’m looking at it from the angle of knowing that a fellow director was done dirty and viewing it opportunistically as the chance to get in good with all the right people at the studio and attain that big money contract to do a Batgirl film.   I mean, don’t you think there’s a reason WB went with their cover story that portrayed it as Whedon doing a big favor for everybody and help shepherd the film through the final lap with some minor touches while Snyder worked thru a personal tragedy?   Sure sounds a lot better than “Mercenary hack fraud douchebag saw college student’s suicide as his big chance. Will help us take a wrecking ball to Justice League in exchange for writing credit and contract to direct Batgirl”.",2
God dammit.,1
"I loved Last Jedi too, and I'm honestly too concerned that Rise of Skywalker will walk back some of the things I like about Last Jedi to be truly hyped? But don't get me wrong, I'm still excited, just in that ""oh god I hope this is good"" kind of way.",1
I hope they do.  Fuck those other guys.,1
Get rid of the trunks and it's perfect,3
"That’s not what I’m trying to say. My point is, DC/WB really shouldn’t be telling Elseworlds versions of stories they haven’t even told properly yet.  Hell, THE FLASH doesn’t even have a movie yet! He’s one of the most iconic superheroes ever!",2
Well that’s not exactly what he said but that’s still true. You do live in a fucking dreamworld if you think they don’t or never have. Sorry.,3
"As far as actual Batman melee it's got to be BvS warehouse. Action set piece overall goes to Nolan, I mean you cant beat the practical truck flipping and airplane crashing.",1

"What, is Black Canary relegated to using Harley's unwanted tools now?",1
"But Shazam is in the DCEU: The battle of Metropolis on the newspapers, the Batfleck batarangs, WW and Aquaman references...",2
How does it compare to the one from CW's ARROW?,1
"And that’s an interesting take! Even Cavill admitted that,  but he also admitted that that take didn’t resonate with enough viewers. Now they need to take a step back and think, “okay, that was a good try, but it didn’t work out in the end. What can we do now that’ll be more successful.”  Cavill imo has a great perspective on his time in the DCEU, admitting as to what worked and what didn’t.",2
Didn't Snyder say it was 214mins?,3
"Indeed, and that gives you a clue in part why. They have something in common the MCU does not : more than one generation of cinematic legacy.",2
There is a Steppenwolf toy that had grey and red colors on it.,1
"Probably going to mention how Fate and Hawkman are members of the JSA, maybe a scene of all of them at the end, when/if Adam is imprisoned",2
"Great discussion.  Considering Batfleck is out, Cavill still a mystery. Releasing the Snydercut can be awkward as we’re in a sense seeing them reprise their roles when their future is unclear or nonexistent.  But they can roll with the punches considering Joker is a different universe, The Batman may be as well. Maybe they aren’t putting together a concrete universe which can be fine. As long as we get movies.",2
It's not an 'S',2
Did you choose to ignore what he said before or are you just being ignorant,2

"I'm not gonna go into another tiring debate about the Sequel trilogy, but ... dude. ""imma kill my dad for no reason"" ? Really? Please tell me you're trolling.  The entire movie told us - and *showed us* \- that Kylo was completely brainwashed and manipulated by his master, the whole ""the Supreme Leader is wise"" schpiel just before is a clear reference to real-world teens being converted to terrorist ideologies and murdering their families in the name of these.  Hell, we had fucking Anakin Skywalker massacring children in the Jedi Temple the literal night after threatening to kill Palpatine for being a Sith lord.  &#x200B;  EDIT: My bad, should've understand you were trolling the second I saw ""cannot orchestrate a modernised light saber battle to save his life"". TFA's duel simply was amazing, it wasn't as overly choreographed as the Prequels, and not as clunky as the Originals. Not to mention that given the physical and emotional state of both combatants, the fight felt perfectly appropriate.",1
"Exactly. The guy arguing with me is in denial of that. Batfleck is clearly not the most remembered big screen Batman, which is bad because he was the most recent. People should remember him more, almost by default. The fact that Bale and Keaton are more remembered/highly regarded should tell you everything you need to know.",2
"You should blame the corporate guys freaking out after Snyder's initial principal photography, so they hired Whedon to make it more Avengers-y, can't blame Whedon fully for doing his job.",3
Do you have even one example of him acting “slimey”?,1
You’re only aloud to share photos of your current projects? Not ones that never saw the light of day?   Also he knows he’s fueling the fire because he knows WB will inevitably break.,2
"Because trying to defend the over designed suit by saying that someone else made an overdesigned suit it stupid. It's like saying ""this Batman film is bad but it's okay because someone has made a bad Batman film before"". The idea is to do better.",1
"Apparently in Snyder's original treatment, he breaks Lex out of Arkham.   And given that Snyder completed principal photography and always aims to shoot a complete movie in that time (not *relying* on reshoots), and that we don't see how Lex gets out or meets Deathstroke, I'd be shocked if there isn't a scene of that waiting to be cleaned up and reinserted.",2
Hahaha no way man but i do think it would have made maybe 20-30 mil extra. Plus the reshoots cost wb 35-40 mil I think that hurt them badly too,1
"Man I respect going in a new direction, and feel as though Ayer got kinda screwed over not having the proper time to develop and interference and all that but, those are hideous costumes lol",3
"If we’re doing his early days and building LexCorp then a mixture of Steve Jobs and Social Network.   If we’re doing his later years as President then a mixture of All The President Men, Frost/Nixon and Vice.  EDIT: Honestly, there so much you could with Luthor character study film and you don’t really even need Superman. Just have Clark appear from time to time as a reporter.",2
How does the guy who was hired to score the thing not know much about it? This is ridiculous.,1
"If we're going to entertain this then you're missing several other possibilities.  1. Sage's mom and Wally's wife are two different women.  Therefore, Sage's mom can die in the BZE and Wally's wife (not Sage's mom) can still walk out on him after the BZE.  This allows Sage to still be Wally's daughter in the picture but to avoid the insanity of arbitrarily lying without motive or conceivable purpose or likelihood of success. 2. Sage and Bruce were mistaken in believing her mom was dead.  We don't see a body, we don't get an aftermath.  While Sage believes her mom was in the upper stories of Wayne Tower, the fact is the BZE had been going on for minutes already now (that's the whole intro sequence of Bruce getting to the tower and that's in media res to boot).  A parent with a young child in the city might not sit still at her desk waiting for Jack to get the OK from the boss.  When a literal alien invasion is occurring, she might make her way down before getting the official word.  In which case, despite Sage's fears... her mom is alive to later leave Wally and keep his story consistent *without* the insanity of ""just lie cuz Lex told you to!"" - It's a little insane to insist upon the ""integrity of intention"" for Sage's pointing scene as absolute truth, but then to gut all of Keefe's later scenes a lying through his teeth for no apparent reason.  Again, what's the motive? 3. It's irrelevant.  Considering no storytelling hinges on this in any material way, it may literally not matter....",1
Was Ray Porter supposed to voice to voice Darkseid in the 5-arc JL or he was the actor that would play him in the same way Josh Brolin played Thanos?,2

"And Cavill believes in Zack. So by the transitive property, you believe in Zack.",1
"Did you link it without watching it?  > We had been working on this franchise for the past, almost eight years, when we started developing the script for Man of Steel. And then we moved on to BvS and also Zack developed the story for Wonder Woman which was leading up to the point of Justice League, where these characters were gonna finally come together. I mean this was a really great hero's journey. A journey for these characters to be who they are today. **So not being able to complete his vision was extremely difficult.**  That's all real shit right there. Everyone else was saying Zack's vision was well intact and Joss was just peppering some small finishing touches on the project. She's saying the opposite. She even said ""not being able"" which shows it wasn't a voluntary decision and also that the finished product was not Zack's.",1

"Gordon’s character isn’t defined by his whiteness, so I don’t really have a problem with it. Hugo Strange in Gotham was Asian and he killed that role, I loved it. Bane’s iconography is heavily pulled from Luchadors, in dress, movement, and demeanor. It’s an iconic figure in Mexican culture that is a huge part of Bane’s character. It would’ve been cool to see Selina be Latina, but again her ethnic/cultural background isn’t really essential to her character and her development so Zoe is great casting in my book.",1

What a waste,3
U think the general audience hate comes from that?,2
That I don’t know. Maybe it was an Avengers1 Thanos case.   Or maybe just Snyder being Snyder and casting smaller people for big roles. (Look how it turned out for Momoa and Gadot tho!),2
As opposed to an unaccomplished director...?,0

Like his manager said. He's playing the strong hand. And probably focused on Witcher and not fucking up any chances with WB.,1
I think she'd make a better Mad Harriet.,1
The success of the MCU started with the main avengers every movie after lead to end game so in order to follow the story people were kinda forced to watch Guardians and ms Marvel and Strange. Once endgame is over unless the next phase leads to Galactus or Doom I highly doubt the next phase will be as successful without Downey or Evans around especially since they are chopping up their universe between the theatres and their streaming network. Black Widow will underperform at the box office just wait and see. So I stand my ground on what I said,1
"I mean, not even that. At least with Joss Whedon's Avengers movie, the characters and universe matched the tone of the film. Everything looked and felt like it was meant to be that way, all the way down to Cap's campy ass uniform. But with this everything felt so out of place. I mean, especially going from really darkly lit shots to that fucking closeup of Aquaman, which I swear belongs in a Colgate commercial.  And at least Whedon's Avengers had a villain with some discernible character. My god, I hated Steppenwolf in this. It was like WB wanted so badly to be marvel that they just straight up hired Whedon assuming he was the key to their success",1
Didn't he throw a box at a dude and stabbed another?,1

"Zack's first DC movie Man of Steel was code-named ""Autumn Frost"" after his daughter, Autumn Snyder. She was also filmed in the Justice League movie briefly wearing a GSU football jacket.  Zack posted on Vero ""Humbled by the outpouring and support #afsp"" on Sunday.  ASFP is the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.  There are fans that have personally told Zack Snyder about coping with depression and suicidalism through his films (including myself). He knows. He has not said it explicitly, but he may want to finish the trilogy for his daughter as well. Zack even said his first instinct was to bury himself with work. However, we don't know for sure, and should let him say it himself if he wants.  Zack Snyder fans have raised over $100,000 for mental health and suicide awareness related charities. It is certainly an issue that is part of the movement.  We should instead go after WB's shameful press release that blatantly lied about their intentions and plans.",2

People hate being wrong. They followed all the lies and grew to believe them and dedicated a lot of time talking a lot of shit. Just to find out that all the shit that came out about JL is proving to be mostly false. The problem with this sub is the tide has turned. Now more people want it than don’t want it. And now the loud minority is becoming the ones that still don’t want it to come out. For whatever their reason is.,2
Exactly! People use that to support their need to see the cut and that’s not cool at all. I don’t like that.,3

What is a small demographic of people that they were using. Specifically within an age range that were mostly associated or Flan's of those particular versions. They didn't get a wider demographic during that poll. It's widely considered by many people that bat Fleck is one of the top Batman. That pull your siding is just of a small narrow demographic of people when it's not actually fully representing the wide demographic of people that I've seen Batman movies. They only one with certain age ranges. Because if you remember when people had to choose between Nicholas Hoult or Robert Pattinson people chose Robert Pattinson but was within a certain age range to. If you do a wider variety of people most people are going to go with that Ben Affleck,0

"Batman vs Superman is great in my opinion, so that's where the opinions differ and no one is right in that aspect. The reason JL is so bad is because the theatrical cut isnt the movie we were promised. As fans of the JL we all were robbed of the story and world building that we were going to get with that movie. And dont be so melodramatic, the legacy of the Justice League isnt destroyed haha. People still love the comics, the animated movies and series and injustice which primarily features the justice league and the fact that people want the Snyder cut or just another JL movie shows that the legacy is not ruined. It just that the movie that was going to kickstart a lot of it was butchered.  As fans we all want it and not the watered down version we got. To see the beginnings of the League in their glory.  Its not a recut. It's the directors cut. The original intended film.",1
"I mean showing him The Dark Knight would be cool too, but not necessary to understand who Joker is.",2

Snyder is fucking back.,2
"No. Everything you said wasn't facts. Pattinson is only popular because he's grabbing a certain demographic of people that will only fade away and won't have the longevity of following a series like the comic book fans that actually follow the series and who are the majority of people that are driving these sales. Also Ben Affleck is considered a very accurate and if not one of the best Batman interpretations of all time so you already setting a high standard there plus we were led to believe that we were going to continuation of that Batman only till recently to learn that Warner Brothers had been lying to us for 2 years when we originally were kind of left in the dark about the situation. So you've already have a split fan base cuz people are still fresh off of the batfleck train and that series of him hasn't been resolved and now we're expected to all the time Jump on another Batman reboot? Now you're only getting a small Art House demographic of people that enjoy those kind of movies as well as Pattinson the movies like the pseudo-intellectuals that think they know everything or actual fans of Batman in actuality they're not going to be interested in the long run like people that actually enjoy these franchises and go further with a character as well as the comic book fans who are also the ones that follow these franchises. Most of these people are either the trendy Twitter crowd that only listen to the latest and greatest movie and since Pattinson is a young popular actor right now and it's scored beeff points especially with the art house crowd, he's the demographic they're looking for where in actuality he really doesn't have the legs to carry out a franchise. He's also not even sure how long he's going to be even doing these movies. They're hoping that with a society of Joker that they can go and make every movie a non comic book style pseudo intellectual Arts house style of comic book movies and go back to the Nolan are of movies where the Mystique and even Mythic characters and yes even Batman's world is now sucked away because they want to create this semi overtly realistic version of a fake fictional Fantastical comic book character",0

A “joke” that’s in bad taste.,3
I am not rewriting history. Dont be ignorant to history. Man of Steel was mixed to mostly positive just like Aquaman. The louder minority of people detracted from the overall success it made. Every single movie has been cofinanced but not that extreme for the most part. So they are not getting the biggest bang for their buck. Shazam barely beat its budget. Mos and Bvs made its budget back.,0

Loool yeah I'm sure there is a big conspiracy and we just gate keeping the Great Zack Snyder lol I saw his cut of BvS and I'd rather never seen another one of his movies.,0
"Sad part is the JL movies could have been just as good as the Marvel stuff if WB didnt fuck up the whole movie, even the cast know the movies sucks dick. That's why Affleck and Cavill left.   Hopefully if the Snyder Cut ever releases, WB gets their shit together and uses the Snyder Cut storyline as the main story, and do a part 2 as it was intended.   Pattinson can do the movies where batman just began, and affleck can be the older batman.",2

I'm afraid of nothing like that. That's just silly and once again belittling of my opinion. You have to realise that there are people that have other opinions than your own. You just dont understand that. You're the one that is being dense and arrogant. High and mighty on this tower of Crusading for Repesentation when you can't accept that you aren't making a difference. So stop trying to force me to see your point of view when I have said nothing wrong  And just because you dont like my analogy doesn't mean its inaccurate. It actually applies very well to what you're apply especially since that is a very liberal mindset in regards to criminals.  Sorry to point out the flaws in your mindset. Accept that I dont HAVE to accept everything. I can just do my own thing and you can do your own. think,1

Or he could do something that a regular human could, like get a cat from a tree. I'd rather Superman use his precious time on problems of his caliber. Like stopping the world engine and saving a little girl a whole nation away from where he is.",2
"Honestly, I thought MoS and BvS were way more depressing than Joker.   Joker starts out with a suicidal, depressed man who hates his life and ends with him finding happiness and self-acceptance.",1
Jumanji went up against Star Wars and became Sony's #1 movie ever (up to that point). I'm sure Black Adam could leg out like aquaman did.,3

Exactly this. Spent a long time defending it but multiple views clearly shows the problems with the movie.,3

What are the chances of Joker surpassing TDKR's box office?,3
"Agreed. I don't feel MoS captured the essence of Superman. I didn't like BvS. I don't think Snyder would have directed a good JL movie.  But even if you disagree, it's over. He wasn't a box office success for WB. He's never going to do more DC films. Releasing the arguably imaginary Snyder Cut isn't going to change anything.   Let's look forwards, not back.",0
It's not Kroll's article,1
That’s not why lol,0
Wait till we get close to release date and they start dropping trailers. Believe me ppl will flock to see batman. Hard to gauge interest in a movie so long away,3
I like what we got more,1
"I still can't see WB execs asking Whedon to specifically include boob jokes and ass shots. I guess they gave him a general idea of what needing adjustements (in their minds at least), but HE chose to go with this shitty content.   That's how I picture it at least.",2
He’s great in Bojack Horseman and he’s a buffalo in that I think,2
It still is lol,3
Just another grey big thing.,1
‘Wonder Woman 1984’ has a strong chance but I’m skeptical Batman will. I don’t think there’s anything to help boost Batman to reach that billion dollar line. And I don’t think Batman not having a proper solo cinematic venture in almost a decade is enough reason for it to.,3
"Oh man, that's awesome! It would be so great to have the Snyder cut!",3
"That's different. When he's already being Superman, he should be using his powers on the big problems. The murderers, the conspiracies, etc. He can't always be Superman, Clark is the true personality, and being Superman 24/7 would kill him emotionally. But when he is being Superman, he should face challenges worthy of Superman.",2
"I absolutely love how one minute this subreddit has a raging hard-on for Henry Cavill, and then at the drop of a hat it's out for his blood. There's a weird cult mentality going on surrounding the Synder Cut for some people.",1
All three are phenomenal.,3
"I see that scene and some of the other ""funny"" moments as placeholder jokes. The joke there was going to be something about the Flash being awkward and in awe of Wonder Woman. Given more time I'm sure that would have been changed. It's not like Whedon isn't super talented. I mean he made Firefly, and I do think some of the jokes in JL really land, particularly ""Aquaman on the Lasso""",3
"While I loved Ben's brutal brute batman, I would REALLY love to see an agile, fast ""ninja"" Batman who fights intelligently. A surgeon as opposed to a blunt instrument.",1
"Variety is wrong in this case, not trades in general. Don’t simplify things.   Oh and The Batman’s castings weren’t reported via “an insider of a source”, they were first reported normally and then *confirmed by the director.*",1
God please don't bring up that terrible fucking Elfman score. So generic.,2
This is kinda why I like the Whedon scenes in JL  Supes is actually in his prime and feels like he's finally become the hero he was destined to be.,1

"I’m not a Snyder fan, but I gotta say the real fault is with WB and their embarrassing incompetence they have with the embarrassment of riches they squander in literally all DC properties.  As a Marvel Cinematic Universe fanboy, I gotta admit that if WB played their cards right a DC Universe would easily be just as great (if not better than) the MCU.",1
I think it's more about the slicked back hair.  The curl stands out a little awkwardly when the rest of the hair is perfectly slicked back. If he could try out a different hairstyle where his hair can be more free (I don't know the right word for this) then maybe the curl would look much better.,3

"Interesting, both credible trades. Waiting for Variety to chime in",3
Batman isn't exactly a reliable narrator in TDKR. He has whole fugue states where he doesn't know what he's been doing  The cops wouldn't necessarily have evidence Batman did it. Both thugs were killed with each others' guns,2

"I just don’t like how he dies because of a dog. A dog that is different in the flashbacks and present day because the dog has died and been replaced. The dog would be dead anyway, but Clark’s father and Martha’s wife could’ve still been with them all these years  Anyway, I fucking LOVE Man of Steel. It’s overwhelmingly heroic, inspiring, and triumphant, while also epic and badass (something that I’d never considered Superman to be before). Johnathan’s death isn’t that big of a deal. And with most movies I love, the more time goes by, the less I care about the flaws and the more I just love the good parts",2
He treats his people well if they swear obedience to him. Kind of like Dr Doom.,1
She was on Ellen and Late night talk shows. She must be relevant.,1
"I'm thinking WB don't want anything to distract from the upcoming teleases (BoP and WW84), so my guess is the ""dead period"" between WW84 and The Batman. That's like 12 months where nothing's happening.",2

How could it not. Of course WB has proven they don’t need to only focus DC large connected big budget epics...but if the Snyder Cut shows a very great large scale beginning to the Justice League then the fan outcry alone would be nearly impossible to ignore from a business stand point.,1
The BVS soundtrack is fantastic. It took me years to fully appreciate it.,2
I wasn't referring to the panels above specifically but responding to the accompanying post which asked about whether or not we'd support a similar reveal about the Joker in a future movie.,2

Would you watch a recast cyborg or black panther played by a white guy,0
"Exactly. I watched and it remined me to a Power Rangers TV series episode. People say it had good visual, I think it had a lot of flashy visual, not good visuals. Anyway, still one of the most successful DC movie...",0
It’s amazing how this Snyder cut movement has made Snyder blameless to everyone. Like the studio wasn’t arbitrarily wary of releasing a dark Justice League movie that’s 3 hours long for no reason. The reception of BvS made them think twice.,1
Apart from retweeting,3
"ehh  The rest of the freakin world watched the movie too, and most of the them didn't have any such issues. This movie was gonna be successful anyway. I mean..it's THE JOKER.. obviously people were gonna watch this. It just exceeded expectations by crossing a billion.",0
I mean we have seen Superman fight Black Adam a lot (In fact I hope we see a DC presents type thing with Superman and Shazam fighting Black Adam)  Plus Superman is kinda the archetypal superhero   ~~Though I kinda hope this is him teasing for Superman being in the Shazam sequel~~,1
Same. But I would like him to be in the third movie.,1
"Whenever people post that, I've noticed that they always argue in bad faith or theyre purposely misinterpreting the scene. People just WANT to thrash Snyder's movies even when it doesn't make sense.",1
"I guess we'll see. I think that the League was originally supposed to have a larger role (or more extended cameos) in early discussions of BvS. Arthur was also originally supposed to have the Aquaman armor in JL, but Wan wanted to use it as a plot point in his film. Given all of this, it wouldn't surprise me if there was a continuity error with Aquaman's duds.",1
"If the screenshotted tweet is specifically referring to Superman's next appearance in the Shazam/Black Adam films, as opposed to his next film appearance *period*, then it's still not believable, imo. Black Adam 2 would literally be in 2025 or beyond. WB isn't currently planning for a Superman appearance in that film, c'mon. To me, it's an obvious BS, pulled out of thin air claim. And I'm not trying to crap on Randolph at all.",1
Ill just have to re-wire,3
Essentially the old school version of the Justice League.  Someone mentioned ‘Golden Age’ and I wholeheartedly agree with that description.,2
This all HAS to mean something.           My head is going to fucking explode when it's officially announced.,3
His head looks like Thanos' ship.,1
What? So Zues and all of them were just aliens? Wonder Woman’s an alien?,1
Except for the murder,1
"I'm excited to some extent for this movie but when I watched the trailer it didn't  move me the first time. I'm more in tune with Black Mask, Huntress, and Black Canary. I feel like Ewan Mcregor is going to crush it. I want to feel that mob presence from him. This movie just feels like SS 2.0. Hopefully it proves me wrong.",1
He tried to make one in 2002 called [Superman: Flyby.] (https://dcmovies.fandom.com/wiki/Superman:_Flyby),1
"I wasn't saying they committed to anything, and infact that's my whole point. This article mostly lists potential possibilities, and very little concrete information, which I think is bad PR because it continues to make them look disorganized. I was just saying we really don't hear much about Marvel movies unless it is pretty much a sure thing or it comes directly from them and that allows them to appear more organized. Every studio pitches things and has plans that fall through, but we hear about all of WB's fails or what ifs more than others and I just think they to try to control that more",0
Nothing you said made sense.,1
Soon they will replace Leto with Joaquin,3
We all get caught up in arguments about things we are passionate about :),1

Well. People are saying his saying Uxas is telling. As he is Darkseid in the present.,2
80 pages amounts to like 60% of the final cut,1
"I, personally, don't care about the general audience.   I'll watch the bland-yet-enjoyable movies too. But the boundary pushing is what really excites me. I don't see JJ as the guy who will give us that. I'll still watch his movies because they are very well made usually. But I'll still miss the weird shit until it breaks out again  Edit: i found like an arrogant dick here. I don't look down on anyone for movie tastes. I just like weird shit that doesn't look like anything else",1

This is my favorite meme honest to god hahaha,1
"Matt Reeves is doing a pretty good job at marketing from just the casting announcements alone. Just as the excitement from the previous one is starting to die down, we hear rumours of another, and then boom, he announces it in a fun and refreshing way.  When it comes time to promote the actual movie, I've got no doubt they're going to pull that off amazingly.",3
No I dont,1
Either as Jay Garrick or Kent Nelson. I just want him as a superhero!,3
Aquaman helps the rest of the world all of the time.  Black Adam doesn't.,1
"Yes. But in the movie, it's touched with CGI pillars behind Batman and I can't see shit",3
magic is just science that the writers havent explained yet,1
"And CW is soft by definition, I used be excited for their shows at first but then they all turned into teenage drama trash, I'm saying Damned was just such a short story that I wouldn't base my opinion on any character just from that book alone. I love Hellblazer and enjoyed Damned because I love Hellblazer, but if I didn't read Hellblazer I wouldn't really know much about the character based on that book alone. Does that make sense?",0
"For real. Batman breaks into buildings and beats people to a pulp sometimes, he absolutely embezzles money from his company and even keeps research for his project off the books.  Sure, it's for the ""greater good"", but he's absolutely right. Do that for 20 years, watching your son that you brought into your side life get killed by a villain you let live over and over and over, seeing almost all of your allies turn on you or die.  That's the world Zack was already in. It's past that idealistic bright start, it's Batman on the verge and ultimately the story he was telling was to lead Batman to be reinspired by Superman to be better, like he was. It's actually really a great story, wish we got it lmfao R.I.P JL",2
"The human look wouldn't have looked scary, and there have been a lot of human-looking villains in the MCU, X-Men movies, Spiderman movies, Nolan trilogy, so this would have been a nice change. Every comic had a different take on the character, the new 52 had a different take on Steppenwolf as well, the same way, Zack had a different take on Steppenwolf as well. Nolan had a totally different take on the Joker as well as Bane, so we should be glad that directors try to be creative.   As for why Steppenwolf was chosen, mainly because of how demonic his design looks. But part of the reason is what you already know that he is connected to Darkseid and the other New Gods. Brainiac would have been a great antagonist for MoS 2, maybe they had plans for Brainiac to be in MoS 2 and that is why they didn't use him in JL. Zack also wanted to end his DCEU at JL 3 by completing the whole Darkseid saga.",0
That’s not how this works. Gods ARE real in the DCEU. Magic is real in the DCEU. This isn’t like how Marvel did Thor in the movies.  Wonder Woman was descended from and Shazam was gifted his powers by mythological gods.,0
"MoS is as simple as it gets. Why would you use a quote that implies it would be misunderstood? And If you tried using the BvS quote from Martha, you got it wrong aswell",0
That would be cool. Sort of like in Batman Mask of the Phantasm how Joker was just a gangster who was part of Sal Valestra’s gang.,3
Honestly hate BVS but MOS aged so well,3
I think its going to be a wonderful time at the theater lol,3
Oh man. I didn't mind his character too...tbh 1st transformers was alright.  I think the studio and producers saw money in their eyes for the sequels and tried to get blood out of a stone with the quality put out.,1
"The more support, the more awareness and demand for the film. Once WB see's that there is demand, they will put a plan in place to release the SnyderCut.",1
Whenever I talk about BvS I only think of the UE cut. It’s the way the film should’ve been released in theaters. Another stupid decision by WB.,2
Bail.,3
I agree on the punchability.   But he will still work on DC films. As a producer. So directors will have to know what theyre getting into with him. Or make sure he isnt the main shot caller producer.   Majorly he just isnt a boss in the studio.,2
What Wan did was a spectacle but I feel Snyder would do something a lot more lord of the rings-ish. It would be amazing.,3
I could see a movie with Supes being a mentor to a younger Supergirl or something (Maybe even add Brainiac like Cavill wanted),1
"Great way to open it, I think. A couple more shots of a grieving world wouldn’t hurt either.",3
We know. This was during the development process not post-Joker.,1
"Several Jokers, but we’ve only had one actually interact with Batman, and that was 11 years ago. As far as I’m concerned, we’re overdue for another true Joker (who's an actual Batman villain)",3
"Same, and it's because we don't need this movie... We want a Flash movie or Green Lantern or any other character that can contribute to this movie universe. I still hope this movie to be decent.",3
This wasnt released until the behind the scenes stuff on bluray.,2
Oh snap. I talked about him in the article but didn’t add him to the list. Thank you!,2
I heard whedon rewrote like 80 pages of Snyder's original cut. If that's true then Jesus fuck we truly do need a Snyder cut. I just can't help but think about an edgy batfleck taking on a merciless Deathstroke. If Snyder's Batman was anything like that warehouse scene OMG.,3
"How does it not - it's fucking batman that you're all talking about. Have an actual opinion will you, when someone calls you out on bias/hypocrisy you can give a valid answer, instead of trying to completely dismiss it.",0
He’s out. Just sounds like it more and more.  I’m glad he has The Witcher.,0
40 of those pages were quips and comedy gags,1
"You’re right, a big hyperbole at that.  What exactly are you basing your personal belief on that all these people from the Snyder Cut movement actually plan on watching a leaked or pirated version instead of the real thing?   I’m talking about business decisions because like it or not, faux pessimism or not, the hashtag trended like crazy last Sunday. There is clearly a big interest and desire for it, not to mention a lot more hype built around it than any other future DC film. A smart studio would definitely want to capitalize on the  current “most talked about superhero movie”.",1
Eye popping too,2
Gotchu,3
Heck yeah!,2
It didn't though. There's a reason actors are required to come back for reshoots. It's not another production it's the same one and is part of the process.   Reshoots are not an extra thing.,0
What about WB's press release that exploited his family tragedy for business reasons?,0
"No man, that’s exactly what it is. I didn’t read anything remotely substantial or previously unheard of.",0
Tru. But a man can dream haha,1
How dare you detective Batman!,1
DC is just sucking balls lately,0
Why do people want Hal Jordan so bad? For the sake of diversity and them being more popular characters I would rather we have John Stewart or Jessica/Simon be the new GL. Hal Jordan can be an older/mentor to them.,1
At what point have I said “Snyder posted this so it means it’s coming out”?    I simply said this was both after Variety released the statement of something not existing *and* Snyder posting very finished pictures of that apparently nonexistent something.,2
"Definetly Lupita Nyong'o, she's a minor character in Black Panther and in the second movie I'm sure Storm will have a lot of screentime so her not returning is viable.  Lupita deserves being the lead of her own superhero movie, not being the girlfriend of one",1
The Snyder above the title is very lame. The Justice League doesn’t need any director to be above there name.,0
Isn’t Black Adam coming out then?,1
OUT AM I?,3
"This happed to me too... Just tag the post, for example, DISCUSSION:",1
The shows version of Ozymandias’ costume is WAY better than the movie version,2
I think everyone should be able to agree this was a boneheaded idea on Snyder's part.  But I'm sure some Snyder fans will find some way to blame this on Joss Whedon or something...,3
"Huh? MoS wasn't critically panned or underwhelming at the box office. It was critically reviewed as ""meh"" and did very well at the box office considering that people didn't really care about Superman anymore. Plus, even a lot of people that hate the movies he's in think he can be a great Superman. They just wanted to rush to the brighter one instead of buildup like the Post-Crisis arc.",2
"The new narrative is ""it doesn't exist\* - move on!"".  \*""It doesn't exist because technically he had some other stuff that he never got to shoot because there were rewrites before principal photography even started"".  I've seen few people being total dicks about this on Twitter because they think that somehow ""proving they're right"" by saying that it doesn't exist on a technicality by redefining what we mean by ""Snyder Director Cut"", they are therefore winning.  It's bizarre. Give it up. It exists. If you hate Snyder and anyone, fan or not, who wants to see his stuff, then just grow up and go do something more productive than railing on people who just want to see something they might enjoy.",3
How do we know the SC was even good tho? Whenever Zack releases pictures online I always get a BvS flashback. There is watch too much going on in his films. It may have fan service but is it well executed?,3
Or just better costumes by the end,3
>Any director who stepped in was in a bad spot. There was no way he’d make a high quality movie with the short time allowed for the reshoots.  They would be in a bad spot but that doesn't mean they would necessarily completely butcher the fucking movie. And there's no excuse for going with Elfman over Zimmer/JXL.,2
"Exactly.  I get Snyder’s rationale and I get Wan’s rationale.  Preferences aside, clearly it makes things logistically easier if they can just talk underwater instead of making air bubbles every time.",1
The music/soundtrack composed by Hildur Guðnadóttir,3
"I find it funny how those who claim to have watched the movie say ""this isn't like Lex Luthor,"" or ""that's not accurate to the comics.""  And what I say is that there is no concrete rule or version for any of these characters.  That's what makes them mythology and not celebrities, DC heroes especially.  They should be what we need them to be in the modern world.    Once you apply some ""rule"" to a character they just stagnate into a pool of circular repetition.  Nothing is advanced, the characters don't evolve.  You have to deconstruct them and find out what drives them and why they are what they are.    This Lex is exactly what that character is today: a spoiled millennial rich kid, too smart, too knowledgeable to accept a Godlike alien in the sky as the most powerful man in the world.  According to him, that position is deservedly his.    And somehow, this is ""not correct"" or ""boring"" or ""not accurate to the comics?""    You're living in a fucking dream world.",2

"Yeah but we're not talking about Captain America are we? That and Cap is not even a good example as he is a good guy 100% of the time and would be acceptable as a leader for the Avengers.  Harley on the other hand isn't a good gal 100% of the time and isn't acceptable as a leader for the Birds as that position is taken by Babs/Batgirl/Oracle of which needs no explanation whatsoever.  Nonetheless when the Birds are out on the field it's typically Black Canary that is making the decisions for the Birds. Black Canary was the head chairman for the Justice League and in this movie she takes a backseat to Harley Quinn, gtfouttahere.",1
"Lol someone's extremely negative. Disney is definitely not buying DC. JL was god awful and left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. That's in the past, but attempting a new JL any time soon without building towards it would be the worst decision. They'll be fine doing what they're currently doing. Just making better, more distinct films. A shared universe isn't necessary in order to make quality films.",1

But Lex still develops as he gains Krypton's knowledge. Plus, adding in flashback scenes of Lex's past is unnecessary. We already have a full story in action",0

A lot of people are saying this is fake which very easily could be. That being said when you look at the line up other the big question over Flashpoint Batman it's not out of the realms of possibility these were the Hot Toys figures for JL1 and JL2.   Hell we know for sure there was Steppenwolf and Cyborg. Didn't Snyder say the Green Lantern would turn up at the end of JL1. Even if he didn't his appearance in JL2 would be quite fitting would it not? We know Darkseid was at the end of JL1 and was the main bad guy in JL2.,0

Is the background made up of clown-esque handkerchiefs or am I reaching?,1
LOL dude. Holy shit.,1
Snyder-Capullo was the reason I digged the New 52. Here's hoping more of their works after Metal,2
I wonder how you're breaking down these numbers exactly when saying Snyder fans got Aquaman to a billion?,3
It’s so perfect. Does this haircut mean she’ll be suiting up for screen tests/costume tests soon? To see what her and Pattinson look like in their suits on camera?,2
"As someone that has never seen any of these films, which one would be a good one to start with? I’ve seen a few of the marvel films but nothing DC since animated Batman years ago.",1
"The thing is, Phoenix won’t take up the role again unless they *are* able to do that. He’s notorious for not doing sequels and has said the only way he’d take up the role again is if they could come up with an interesting enough follow up. He’s not in it for the money.",3
Yeah I get your point. I think whats the most annoying is we know for a fact that WB would make a Black Superman just to be diverse and get that diversity money.,0
I don't think it's unpopular or even popular.   Superman's cape length varies in the comics. Personally the cape should serve a purpose. Either he uses it for his whirlwind drill move or a shield.   I think it can end at his knees.,1
Has Chris come out recently to support the snyder cut at all? Just curious,2
Go all the way and have the Atlanteans blow bubbles to use echolocation.,2
I'm sure Atlanteans have more than one outfit they wear; especially in a situation like this where Steppenwolf is trying to take back the Mother Box they were protecting.,2
Because calling someone a cuckold is a lazy insult and it's just people being edgy,1
Bloodnofsky.,1
Not really. That movie is a mess and no recut will fix it. The entire premise of the movie is dumb. MoS went from suddenly fighitng Batman to everyone fighting in JL. You can't fix that without pretty much erasing the first two movies which exists.  What they need to do is do a MoS sequel so we can loop BvS and JL out of the narrative.,1
"I want a GLC film as well, I just don't think John's is actively working on it, I think it was a side project old management gave him once he was booted off of the grander DC Universe project, now with new management they probably but the kibosh on it.",2
"Serious question. If you didn't like a film but it made a billion, would it matter at all to you how much money it made? This isn't a criticism against any of these films, I just notice people cite financial returns as a metric for a film being ""good"" but there are numerous cases where this isn't necessarily the case. Mad Max: Fury Road and Blade Runner 2049 were some of the best films of the past 5 years and they were box office bombs. Meanwhile, those horrible Michael Bay Transformers movies made gobs of money. Money is not an indicator of quality. People should praise movies because they personally liked them not because of how much money they made.",0
I think Joe’s Deathstroke is the thing I want to see the most in the DCEU. He’s fucking awesome!,3
Whoa. When can I buy my ticket?,1
"He’s promoting the Witcher for Netflix. Is he in the position to promote another’s studio unofficial project, while promoting his Netflix show that premieres next month. Ben, Gal,Momoa, and maybe even Fisher are still heavily involved with WB, and not promoting other projects at the moment.",3
Lesser known? You're comparing Ray Porter to Momoa and Cavill? Momoa was featured in a very memorable role in the biggest show of all time and was one of the most recognizable people in the world when he was cast. Henry Cavill was a rising TV star who'd made the shortlist to play James Bond. Who is Ray Porter?,1
Black superman is as touching as white black panther,2
"If I'm wishing for stuff, I'd rather have a JL sequel with Affleck again where we complete Snyder's goal of having Batman eventually die, and then he could pass the mantle on to whoever else, be it Pattinson or someone else.  But I just love Affleck Batman, so if Reeves wants his Batman movie to stay out of the canon of the rest, I say why not let him?",3
Holy shit now this is some noteworthy news,1
Billions of revenue but 0 profits made. Hollywood accounting,1
"Yeah Pa Kent's death kind of annoyed me. I can kind of understand it, but it should have been done differently.",3
Lovely.  Superman standing in front of New York feels so wrong to me lol,1
I feel Black could work well (Alternatively there's Luthor and Parasite),1
">You haven’t stressed the opposite at all, not in this conversation and I don’t remember every single one we’ve had the past few years  ""I've no issue with him killing Zod."" And I've never had an issue with it. If you think that I've had an issue with it over these years it's because you've been putting words in my mouth just like you've done here.  >And no, it’s not bad storytelling if people don’t buy it. Too many weren’t going to buy it anyway because “not muh Superman”, they don’t care that it makes sense  That's where we'll have to agree to disagree. Superman having to kill because he has no choice isn't a difficult concept or one that people are incapable of accepting. You think people being upset about it is proof they can't accept it. Me I think it's proof that they didn't sell it well. The fine details of the execution just don't sell him having the dilemma that he's facing well. Snapping Zod's neck is the resolution to a poorly executed piece of drama.",1
I can’t deny I’m curious to see what the Joaquin-verse’s grown up Bruce Wayne / Batman is like.,1
"We do know because of the quantity of checks and because Greg says monthly.  Even if it stopped 6 months ago, both sides would reach out in ways that are beyond Lex's control.  The protest PROVES that.  If it were about checks NOTHING stops Wally from blurting out, ""I want my Victims Fund Checks!"" on national TV.  In which case, guess what, they'd investigate and fix the check situation and Lex loses his patsy... which is exactly why Wally WASN'T a part of the plan until AFTER the protest.  But that's too short to Capital Hill to account for all the checks, therefore, Wally returned the checks himself.  Lex saying notes plural only requires *awareness* not responsibility.  Given that the checks are a form of protest and Lex is telling Keefe he'll help him protest, it's plausible that Keefe showed Lex that he'd been returning checks.  That's sufficient to clear the awareness hurdle to explain BOTH Lex's awareness AND manipulation by sending the last copycat newspaper note.  Lex is a patient planner, for sure, which is why he sits on his plans for months until he finds Kryptonite.  Nonetheless, such patience is rational and logical and lends towards concrete predictable goals.  There is NO WAY to use the interception of checks to predictably create the patsy he needs TWO YEARS later.",1
Thank God. This guy is literally Superman for so many people,3
Do a Superman or a Two-Face version,1
When Todd Philipps went to the WB Studios  [Todd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rkAjnFB1g4),2
I’d be fine if they made the next Superman movie very comic book accurate and a little campy like Aquaman with a couple scenes like this!,1
Okay this is epic 😎,2
"I feel like they forgot a movie,  there should have been Joker and Harley before her emancipation.",1
"Personally I find JL more enjoyable. Superman Returns is a snore fest along with a creepo stalker Superman.       JL has more than one good scene, Henry as a more upbeat Superman(which is what I waited 3 movies for), and overall the cast just makes it more enjoyable. JL also has the upside of not being directed by Bryan Singer.",2
That warehouse seen tho that’s what I wanna see more of .,1
Its essentially like GOTG where none are actually speaking English but they all have ear pieces that translates it,3
Jay's been a beacon of hope during this whole fiasco. Spitting facts and truths,3
I like the Assembly cut of Alien 3 which is close to Fincher's intended vision for the movie.,1
Yeah. Let's not forget other things great writers made in inexperienced times of their lives. Aronofsky had that God awful Batman script after all. Talented people worked on Superman lives. The writers of X2 made Superman Returns.,2
"I'd say Batman Damned was more Hellblazer than the NBC show or CW Constantine. He was way too soft, as the stories. Now, City of Demons was pretty good, that was pretty Constantine. Now, that new comic series that's coming, that one seems to be the most Hellblazer shit we've had since Hellblazer ended. I love it.",1
If anything Hawkman n Doctor Fate would probably just mention the JSA. But I’m definitely excited this will be happening. Always love Hawkman n Doctor Fate. Hopefully this leads to solo movies with future JSA movies,3
"Yep, but people still picture Margot Robbie's Harley with _him_. It's funny how things work.   It might have something to do with how Harley Quinn was designed to match Leto's Joker's design.",0
"Yes.  My love of this version of the character is that he's super*man*. Meaning he has the personality, life, upbringing, struggles and moral compas of a human being. He just happens to posess the powers of a god. And that's how the character is conveyed.  We see him struggle with things. we see him try and figure out his place as a man *and* as superman, we see him as a 3 dimensional character. Not a 1 dimensioal nostalgic cutout.  I honestly feel like a lot of people's real issue with Mos is that ot's not the Marvel formula. And TBH, that's a huge part of why I loved it.  I personally loved the Reeves superman a lot as a kid too. But it's been SO damn long since I saw that now. I'm gonna have to rewatch that and the director's cut of Superman II as well.",2
If it’s successful Snyder coming back to direct more movies,0
More like the king and queen of my toilet,1
Not bad though I still feel a mix between the Legion of Doom and the Cadmus Conspiracy from JLU would be amazing,1
"Yeahh I get that, it can be too negative for my liking",1
"Yes, what about you?",0
I never thought about this but it’s perfect,1
[Weeeeellll...](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtbDv6RA8v3/),2
That's exactly my impression as well.,3
"I never said it was a good idea. In fact, all I said was that made sense. Sometimes things that make sense in the real world don’t work in film. Quit getting your panties in a bunch because I defended the notion that Snyder is allowed to think creatively and he tends to ground things in our reality, including the supernatural to a certain degree. Yeah it’s not that good of an idea. He’s still allowed to consider possibilities.",0
"The Batfleck and Deathstroke movie that was taken from us, deserves justice!",2
because they change design at the least minutes to comic design but to add colors in the last minutes can cause some issues if some of colorist forgot to add in red.,0
">I think what he's getting at is the fact that the fans are the ones that do watch these movies  No, general audiences watch them, some of whom happen to be fans. Fans have not nor have they ever been the driving box office force for superhero movies.",1
he's God's gift to film making.,1
">Are you really trying to say that because what YOU wanted to happen doesn’t make any sense in this story, it means Snyder doesn’t have the skill to do it?  I've no issue with him killing Zod. But i think people wouldn't complain about it if they'd sold it better.  >Look, just because you dislike a story, does not mean it’s bad storytelling or that it doesn’t make sense.  If the storytelling is bad then then it doesn't matter how much sense the story makes. People aren't going to buy into it which is what a good story should do.",0
I don't see why they would change her name. literally an Egyptian goddess name way before the Islamic terrorist group,1
I hope they separate this from dceu. Leave dceu as it’s own contained story. Transformers got so retarded when they kept adding things like that and it just made no sense,0
This isnt the full comment. The guy was saying how it was a bummer that Henry couldn't comment. However the guy then further goes and says that he will join us in the Sun or something similar to that and ask am I right Zack? With Zack replying I feel you. Meaning that Zach is getting at what the guy is referring to. For example when Zack did that post that said he has yet to rise.,1
">Geoff Johns  Geoff is the one of the mortal enemies of Snyder fans, lol. So it's funny that he had a major role in the script.",3
Yeah I can't stand how Bale fights it's like a boxer when he was trained by Ninjas makes no sense,3
Well Ben's Batman at certain points was really turning into fatman. You could tell in BVS nad JL when he was in shape and when they needed to reshoot his scenes.,3

"If you are basing it on a manip, it is worth nothing actual lighting would be different.",1
" I’m actually pretty chill right now, so Im kinda worried of whatever you read.  (If I’m not having a breakdown but a stranger online is telling me I am, what should I say...?)  I’ll agree on one thing: yes, the Snyder Cut can indeed exist. As it *does,* as it’s been confirmed multiple times already by people who worked on the film. That has stooped being a debate a long time ago. Wanna know what else happened a long time ago? A fella named Bob Fritz wrote an article about the “WB insider that was confused about this fabled cut that doesn’t exist”, citing things like “unfinished score and effects”.   Let’s just politely say that article isn’t exactly looked back as the magnum opus of accuracy or honesty these days.",1
"I'm mostly talking to the people who bitch about Snyder's ""bad writing"". Him purely as a storyTELLER is just personal preference. On that side, I think he has a lot of good (MoS, a lot of BvS, Watchmen), but also some bad (Sucker Punch, Sucker Punch, Sucker Punch. Have I mentioned I really hate Sucker Punch?).",0
"Jesus, people I'm only talking DCEU here. Sucker Punch sucked, I know. 300's sequel sucked, I know. Guess what, there are tons of movies otherwise good directors or writers have done that suck. Goyer wrote the scripts for TDK trilogy. He also directed Blade Trinity. Am I saying one negates the other? No, I'm saying that the situation is much more complex that ""good writer or bad writer"". Richard Lester was known for great movies. He also made Superman III.     Not to mention that I don't even think the script was the 300 sequel's problem. The problem was there never should've been a 300 sequel.",0
Going into that thread is like going into a whirlpool of depression to me,3
"I liked those moments in the score, sure, but I didn't like the way that Elfman shat on everyone who came after him.",1
I don’t know if there’s a part 2 in this...,2
Not sure how to PM can you PM me first?,1
He also said this about Henry Cavill https://twitter.com/GeekVibesNation/status/1197657341069582338?s=19,3
Not a fan of this doughboy,0
Who is the artist? This looks sooo good!,1
The fact we’ll never see these three onscreen together again saddens me :(,3
"Leto is my favourite. I loved the direction they were going with him, such a shame we didn't see more.",1
I don't know. It could very well be fake. If it was fake you think they would make it less wild though.   He mentioned that the designs came in in 2016 so it could easily be before WB wanted a softer Steppenwolf. Also who knows where JL 2 and 3 would have gone.,2
Them cape points are on point!,3
"I could see it being about a man who wants everything yet feels as though he can never attain it all.  A good chunk of the movie should show his childhood and why he acts the way he does, taking inspiration from Smallville by showing his complicated relationship with his father.  Over the course of the movie, he gains more and more power, going from a genius stuck in Kansas to a CEO of a fortune 500 company to the damn president. However, he's always followed around by the mild-mannered Clark Kent.  Even though Lex has much more than Clark, he still can't help but be jealous, thinking there's something Clark's hiding, some secret to how Clark has what he considers a happy life. I don't think we would really see Superman on-screen but it is left ambiguous if aliens do exist in this world or if Luthor's just going insane",2
"That's not a bad shout, I didn't even consider that. Anything would be better than what they're doing to Cassandra.",2
"As far as we know, he’s still in contract negotiations (I’m assuming since Henry has said he’s not done yet, even a year after reports stated that he was out).",3
There were rumors of JJ Abrams doing a Superman movie. Take it with a grain of salt though.,3
Fuck harry potter lol why are you bringing this up lol.,1
"I agree, MBJ is overrated.",1
What do you mean back???  His status is still in limbo.,1
"Besides the skin tone, I don’t see what difference it would make.",2
I didn't like in JL how you could see the muscle suit on Cavill. It broke immersion...,1
That doesn’t really matter to those fighting for it anyways. They’ll defend it to death.,1
Arguably the best batman run,3
"As Cavill said, BvS is a Batman movie.",1
They are actively looking for a director based on the rumors (by top trades),3
I have never heard of Deadwater prior to this thread. Thank you for sharing :D  He looks awesome!,2
"Sure, why not. At least its Superman material and not.. Harley Quinn.",1
Yes it’s a known reshoot.  The League of our Own line was green screened in from the reshoots.   There’s BTS footage of it with the clapperboard mentioning “Dir: J. Whedon”.  Not sure if all the Lex stuff in that scene was a reshoot.  Not sure if any of the Deathstroke footage was reshot.,2
they're not quite jeans. his whole costume is militaristic and the pants are more like fatigues,3
WB's restrictions are really dumb at times.,2
"> I don’t know about that second disagreement. Her death can make you bitter, yes. But her leaving you after losing your legs because she can’t or doesn’t want to deal with you? That can make you bitter because you’re not just losing your wife, you’re pride as a man and belief in love is hit.  Uh... I mean this would make sense if Lex lied to Wally and said his wife left him when she actually died, causing him to feel worse and more insecure about his legs.  In the context of the story, it literally makes no sense lol.  We’re talking about Lex controlling the narrative on Superman right?  Superman causing his wife to die would make people hate him for taking everything from Wally.  His wife just leaving him and taking their kid with her for him losing his legs would just make people think the wife is a heartless asshole.  If anything, the lie only helps Superman compared to telling the truth.",1
This movie was suppose to be grand and epic. Its so sad to look at what WB did to it. Hopefully they make it right and #ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
"You haven’t stressed the opposite at all, not in this conversation and I don’t remember every single one we’ve had the past few years. And no, it’s not bad storytelling if people don’t buy it. Too many weren’t going to buy it anyway because “not muh Superman”, they don’t care that it makes sense, they hate that it even happened. And to try and justify it, they try to talk about how it doesn’t make sense when it actually does.  Just look at the start of this thread.",0
"I found this today and have not seen it on this sub before, apologies if this is a repost. I was completely blown away by the attention to detail from both movies and never realised they lined up perfectly. The more I watch these movies the more I love them.",2
Ur welcome :) Loved the design and that story arc.,1
I mean. That whole Mera scene could have been reshoots. Whos to say there was just multiple bubbles popping open?  And honestly it wouldnt bother me one bit if everytime an atlantean spoke one of the mystics opened a bubble for me.   As long as I see the film,1
Now THAT is something I can get behind. None of that blue/grey and yellow oval bat-symbol crap.,0
"I trust Variety much more than I trust Ray Porter, that’s for sure.",0
He does. IIRC Jay Oliva confirmed this.,2
I agree.I don't think he's a bad director but I don't think he's amazing and I totally thibk Joaquin Phoenix elevated the script and direction a lot.,1
nothing about this looks like a run of the mill chick flick lol but ok,0
I feel grateful everyday this abomination and a disgrace got fired.,0
"There Will Be Blood has long been on my list of films I just never got to and still intend to see...  I've seen the ""milk shake"" scene and it actually makes me laugh out loud. Now so does this one, lol. I know I'm seeing it out of context, but I'm like wtf? lmfao",1
I have spoken,1
It's coming bois,0
Whatever you need to tell yourself to sleep better I guess.,1
Esai is such a great Deathstroke. And his suit is definitely awesome looking.,3
"But why? The panel isn't really clear enough to definitively say he did shoot them, let alone kill them, again, there's no entrywound but there is a hole in the wall (though I will say that could already have been there from the previous gun fire or any number of things). And with the fact that him shooting them isn't mentioned again by anyone, and him saying he didn't kill anyone, I think there is a valid case to be made that he didn't shoot them at all",1
"oh, I missed that! I'll have to check it out",1
X9,2
This is good PR. It's a positive article despite what you are taking from it.,2
"has happened just like it was going to get released at comic con, right?",1
"Well the new fans couldn't get Shazam to a 400million but the Snyder fans got AQ to 1 billion, along with the rest of the world. Also a movie doesnt need to reach one billion to be successful. That's just flawed logic. Profit is a profit",0
"Wan called dibs on the golden scale armor, which is at least one reason why we didn't see it earlier. They really made it work in *Aquaman.*",2
Justice League: Colorized by Ted Turner.,3
"i want cillian murphy again, his scarecrow didnt get enough attention",2
"I really hope that The Rock uses his influence to nudge WB to keep Henry around for future movies. Under the same agent and the fact that the two are friends, he should be able to at least negotiate for it to happen.",3
Pops him like a balloon,1
"It looks like plastic and then adding the eye ridge/bump on the eyeless side of the mask, rather than keep it smooth also makes it look awkward.  Buy everything else about the suit works.",1
That stuff is ridiculous. He went out of his way to put Easter eggs for Snyder's DCEU when he didn't have to. To think he deliberately used a double while not showing a head over the actor is unbelievable.,1
"Joker with the rocket launcher that batmobile,breaking,I love it.",1
"Superman is the physical embodiment of the american dream, that a seemingly average person could come to the country and be super. To properly represent this, Superman has to be white. He is supposed to be the average American, and most Americans are white.   Also, your language is worrying. Is the only way to shake up a character by erasing their racial history? His writing doesn't matter, but his skin colour does? With all due respect u/thefalcon85, you sound like a real pathetic person. If you're white, you're trying way too hard to be liked by black people. If you're black, you're being a child.  Check your zipper, your idiocy is showing.",1
Aka: I gots bills to pay,1
We were robbed.,1
"Because he has a particular personality with being particular, and that guy would do that for fun I'd imagine.",0
Outside of 300 all his movies he’s directed have been trash which is sad considering he’s had some amazing properties to work with,0
"""i DoNt aPpreCiaTe aNy Of TheM"" you're not being obvious, infact you're obviously gunning for sarcasm against snyders interpretation. Don't play the victim here. So don't get offended when someone calls you out on crap like this. If what you're saying is exactly that, say it 'why can't there be both?' but you didnt. Don't just play a game of context and sarcasm twister. Plus saying Snyder doesn't have any of those things in his movie, is false, if you actually watch it.   If you want your heart warmed watch a Pixar movie. Superman isnt written to warm your heart. Unless you're talking atleast 30 years ago. He's an inspiration to some more so an admiration. The world is bigger than walking old ladies across the street. Which is the point of the modern relevant reiteration. People and the audiences need that element of escapism.",1
woohoo we get to see Batmans parents get shot again!,1
Aqua man sucked as a story and the script was weak and overall a bad movie  But it had cool action stuff and all the ads in people supported it so it made a billion. It’s the Asian black panther,1
"Poorly narrated, lackluster final act, joyless and visually too dark? I know people wanna see it, but I simply afraid it may not live up to the expectation.  But fuck, I would rather watch that 100 times then watch Justice League one more fucking time, I swear the god I will craw my eyes out and I’m not even joking.",1
Imo his original design was sick. Unfortunately the only complete footage we have of the original Steppenwolf is in BvS.,3
"> And he later clarified on Twitter that it was a part of the DCEU but would focus on Batman.  No he didn't, he never again used the term DCEU, he simply says Batman is part of the DC Universe. Reeve's has been dancing around this question ever since he first made the statement.",0
the black canary critique is something i actually sort of disagree with. I mean what exactly is she supposed to be wearing? In the comics she typically wears street clothes.,1
">	This won’t get someone killed or harmed. It’s a movie.   Yeah, it’ll only cost them their job.",2
"If this is true, I would’ve cried like a baby starting off JL. I am not ashamed to admit that. LOL",2
You’re right there’s always hope. It’s going to be interesting to see how this all shakes out.,2
"the only reports I can find on it is from CBR, are they trusted or not?",1
Also why would you think trying to cancel an entire streaming service because you didn't get a product is fair?  It's honestly a petty and dickish mood,1
All over the place? Where? Pretty much every person was too busy bashing BvS when it came out to actually look for details like this.,3
I mean they CGI'D abs on to him during the training montage.,2
"Some characters are just too important to change whether its race, gender, or the costume itself. I’d say Superman is one of those characters. It wouldn’t surprise me at all though if they casted him as Superman because the DCEU is full of race bended characters, most of which I actually like: Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Commissioner Gordon, Catwoman, Deathstroke, Black Adam, Black Canary, Deadshot. So honestly its probably not a big deal either way. Betty White could be Supes for all I care as long as we get a good Superman movie",1
Good but too old,1
Still get goosebumps whenever I see that scene,2
How did I not notice this before lol,1
All true.   but that argument was about if WB execs would push for 'boob jokes and ass shots' -- and they've clearly done that in previous movies already with different directors,1
Is this true or not? Because now some news sites are reporting that the sequel rumours are false.,1
"It can be changed if they really wanted to show that the Snyder Cut is very different. I talked with my VFX friend of my, he said it would take 40-60 million dollars to have a new Steppenwolf design.",0
That first shot is Arthur talking with Vulko and Mera. Warning him of Orm and the threat coming to the surface. Arthur dismisses them to go see his father. This ending would have perfectly preceeded the solo Aquaman movie but Vulko's look is totally different. More like the concept art released by Michael Wilkinson.,2
"That’s literally the definition of masculinity. Muscular, leadership, courage, figurehead. The word is “masculinity” not Mansculinity. Plus she didn’t need to be so muscular, neither was the ones portrayed in the comics. I mean Clark Kent is so much smaller than Batman but he can obliterate anything in front of him. Same reason as Wonder Woman, they’re not human.",1
"The film won't come out until 2021, this shut turns me insane. If the DCEU started well at the start, we would've gotten something like the batman before 2020 for Ben, but no fuck this shit.",0
I'm a firm believer everything said since Zack stepped away is just Henry playing ball with the studio for his future in the role. Understandably so. Ben shows support even though people were somehow convinced he left because he didn't like this Batman. He left because of the shitshow behind the scenes and studio politics.,3
Omg who cares? It's a 1 second gag.,0
"Wow, I like, REALLY like this. I’ve never been a fan of the undies, but they actually look good here. It just fits the suit. The cowl is cool, the blue and grey looks fantastic, the logo is new and nice looking. Great job man! I would love to see something like this in the film",2
"Thanks dude. Can't find the SnyderCon one. But will keep searching, cheers for the link.",1
Click on username and start chat....anyway I sent reply check that out,1
"Yeah people reacted negatively towards Leto that’s why WB let Joker happen imo. If Birds of Prey turns alput to be good, I don’t think we will see other Harleys.",1
Stop. I can only get so hard.,2
The people’s anti hero,1
"2 great, 2 meh...okay",1
The only time he's killed was during the chase scene,0
Yes JP is nominated,3
"DCEU was okay when Wonder Woman hit the cinemas, sooooooooooo....",0
"I really think TLH is gonna be even more than just inspiration. However with that in mind, I think that a lot of the villains are going to be different, I think someone may replace Grundy (or just omit his small role from the story). I still would like a live action Grundy in the DCEU, maybe as a small villain in multiple movies, with a redemption story a la Justice League Unlimited.    Also as much as I would love to see Bardem take on Darkseid, I think Darkseid technically already has a voice actor, I do not remember his name though.",1
Jordan can be Clark Kent... there’s nothing about Clark Kent that says he has to be white dude.,0
"It shouldnt be a problem considering pattinson is a better actor than Affleck and has a larger fan base,plus affleck isnt that popular with general audiences, THR did a survey with people most beloved batman and affleck was at the bottom, he is nowhere as popular as keaton or bale in the role, if the batman is good pattinson will already be more popular than him",1
Yea Joss you can go suck one.,1
Balanced.. has potential to be seen as 2 different movies if seen from Batman's perspective once and supes' at another viewing.,1
"I don't know if I see Thanos with that same Iron-seid vibe.  Iron-seid was a kind of Darkseid who was scheming and incredibly threatening, not to mention petty.  Brolin Thanos was always more sympathetic.",1
"no, he's just satting that each portrayal was better at certain things than the other",1
"I laughed at pretty much everything because I like Whedon's humor in general, but that part where Batman was stuttering when Superman showed up as if he was too shy to talk to his crush was a low blow.  The Pet Sematary bit had me in stitches and so did the one in the beginning with Barry drawing that guy's face with the marker. Flash was comedy gold to me in JL and I enjoyed the movie as a Saturday morning extended episode, but it just doesn't fit with the other two.",2
This article is literally a panel of speculative commentary from outsiders. They have no idea what DC is doing. That's funny to me.,1
Should pass 700M OS real quick.,3
"I guess I'm viewing it as a separate issue from the theatrical release at this point. But the replies here make me realize it's not nearly as simple as I've thought, I've never considered exactly how much completion a Snyder JL cut would still need",2
Is it that fucking hard to do a Superman/Shazam vs. Black Adam live action movie??,0
"Lol, wut?",1
"This is absolutely awesome but there’s still a thing  I quite don’t get:  Okay, bring in the Justice Society of America, love that. But if Black Adam is in the same universe as Shazam, and Shazam is in the same world as MoS and BvS, and if the events of JL are in the same world as MoS and BvS, how exactly are they gonna explain this group of superpowered people that possibly existed even before Wonder Woman battled in WW1?   Are they gonna be undercover? From the future..?",1
Yay! Dr. Fate love,1
"Aquaman was certainly not a film that I enjoyed, but I’m glad the movie has made some DC fans happy. It just sucks we can’t have films like Aquaman AND BvS, though. With the “Snyder Era”, it felt like we could only have one type of film while post-Snyder feels like we can only get one type of film too...although, perhaps I’ll be proven wrong with darker films in the form of The Batman mixed with lighter films if we ever begin to see a resemblance of a shared continuity.  Excluding Joker simply because it’s far and away from any DC shared universe.",0
"> nstead of using the original director's footage, reshooting 3/4 of the movie from your previous experience in a similar field but with a completely different aesthetic, ruining it, and delivering an entirely different end result.   That's what WB want: Different direction. Otherwise they would let Zach stay.",0
I got into both characters with Injustice weirdly enough.  I've been more of a bits and pieces person with the character than grabbing comics.  Just the lore itself is pretty interesting to me.,1
Well then you need to get your eyes checked bud.,1
Diana Ross & The Supremes   Beyonce and Them  I mean....I get it..... I get it,2
Didn't see that so didn't catch that . Thanks for clearing it up though,1
They did see it fit to bless us with a Jared Leto Joker though... How bad could it have been....,3
I think you misspelled pedophile ring that the elites and government are running,1
How? Reeves has all creative control over it. Studios cant interfere. That was the only reason they were able to get him to direct batman. He initially declined it because WB wanted to interfere in his work.,2
Very similar to how the Snyder fans use the word “deep”.,1
Shuffling off Cyborg makes me uncomfortable especially since Katana is not a leaguer.,1
The full cut is 214 minutes. The intended Theatrical Cut would've been 170 minutes.,3
"Exactly.  And both companies can experiment with different genres and themes, so long as they do them well. That way there is something for everyone.",3
"Last time I checked, normal human beings living in Gotham age like real people and can't magically change their race.",0
I was considering Helena Bonham Carter for Granny but I didn’t see it. I think that Kathy Bates would be better suited for that role.,1
Then just watch Superman 1,2
Cool. Doesn't mean he has to participate in the Snyder Cut movement. He clearly wants to move on from that. Let him.,3
"Maybe Mr. J is a member of Falcone's goons and Batman is indirectly responsible for his origin?  And we see a fully formed Joker going against Batman in the 3rd movie?   With the numerous villains already existing in Matt Reeve's Batverse, I'm pretty sure Arkham Asylum will be teased.",3
Of course it will be connected as matter of facts wait see character form that movie popping up in Aquaman 2.,1
C'mon already JJ!. I need to see him save a cat from a tree!!.,2
Hell yeah! Superman is back!,0
"> I think as a movie this looks great. I just wish as a comic book adaptation it'd look a little more recognizable.  That's exactly how I feel.  I'm excited, but by the looks of it, it feels more like a student film homage or something.  ""Eh, none of my friends look like the heroes and I don't have good costume budget, let's re-imagine them...""",3
"Oh, so Zack Snyder is just some blogger, and it wasn't official until a well known clickbait author posted it on a site that you personally deem as respected.  Gotcha.",0
"> There's not even a need for that, dude simply has to have a basic understanding of human psychology.  Hi.  > BvS clearly implied that the Joker killed Robin and defiled his suit, that Gotham has a long history with him.   Yeah. His killing / being ""mean"" is relatively new. I got that part.  > If Batman was that far fallen that manslaughter of nameless criminals was no longer an issue to him, someone with as personal a beef with him as the Joker he would keep alive, just to make him suffer on the long run.  I think that's a reasonable position to take on the matter. I don't happen to agree but it's not nonsensical.  > That, or the Joker laid low during the time Batman started killing   Yeah, this was my go-to justification when I bothered trying to explain it to myself.   The issue is that this discussion usually ends up being BIGGER than the specifics of the BvS manslaughter and devolves into *""if you think Batman can dish out all those beatings to criminals over his career without committing manslaughter then you're crazy""*. That's just too far for me and what I originally thought the comment I responded to was getting at. I may have been wrong.",1
I think he’s a good actor so definitely!,2
Missing quite a few but this looks dope,0
If BvS performed well they would have. Even Zack said in the video he felt insecure about his ideas after seeing how BvS performed.,1
Didnt they have Isis in legends of tomorrow but had to change her name?,1
"Yeah, when the JSA rumors first appeared, I wondered the same thing. The JSA are a public team, that is not hidden from society. The DCEU kind of established that superheros and metahumans were a new phenomenon, much like the New 52 comics continuity did. Batman was was an exception.  Regardless, I'm excited for the JSA appearing in the film. I was never a huge fan of New 52 inspired decision to make metas and superheros a new occurance.",1
"It's possible this is looking through the boomtube at the end with the justice league looking at him. Maybe Diana ends up saying something to him?   Fan theory dialogue time. Supes ""who is that?"" Diana ""Uxas"" Uxas ""No, Darkseid"".  Does that work?",2
You got it dude.,1
"Yeah. Yet people hand wave the Earth turning backwards in Superman 1. No, this is what needs long explanation.",1
"So, what exactly is gatekeeping?",1
"Any movie can work if it actually looks good. The movies you just listed were genuinely awful and didn’t bring much of anything new to the table. As for BoP, I think having that John Wick dude coming in to oversee the fight scenes will appeal to a lot of people. Not to mention it’s a known comic book movie so it already has an insane advantage.",1
I think there was a rumor that Pedro Pascal will be Doctor Fate but we’ll see,1
"If things work out for the foreseeable future and movies like Black Adam, Suicide Squad, Aquaman 2, WW84, Shazam 2, and Batman (hopefully it’s still in the DCEU) are successful, then you can likely anticipate crossovers again.   Right now the move for them is to focus on their own little corners of the universe and get the ball rolling on telling good stories that General audiences can enjoy. When they do that, they can get a little more ambitious and do major crossovers again. Hopefully right this time.",3
"Preach it. Nothing screams “I’m not a mysterious entity of the night, just a dude in a fancy suit of armor” more than wearing a suit of armor.",1
"Actually I was not dismissive, only when you began insulting my stance on the situation as well as peoples preferences for something versus something else. Sorry, nice try. Have a nice day!",1
Yeah its like 50 days old.  It'll age way better if they don't make a franchise out of it.,3
Superman 2 wasn’t a flop it was a well reviewed box office hit.,3
Chad Stahelski did WB/DC a favor by doing uncredited reshoots for Birds of Prey. Maybe he can convince Keanu to take on the roll and in return he gets to direct a Doctor Fate movie?,1
YESSSSSS!!,1

What’s this a movie that isn’t the Snyder Cut? what is this doing here?,0
"Small demographic. Comparative to the hundreds of thousands of people that enjoyed Batman on BvS, regardless of if they liked the movie or not. That's how strong his batman was. Considered the best.",0
I love Jay so much. He takes zero shits from anyone.,3
I think he can probably have anything he wants now.,3
HE LOOKS SO FUCKING COOL,3
"The one that came in that morning was a newspaper clipping with what was assumed to be a check. The other ones were checks sent back with the same red writing. And Lex said little red noteS. Plural. Lex himself was responsible for the Big Bang, you really think he wasn’t responsible for the others? Lex Luthor was intercepting Keefe’s checks, otherwise Keefe wouldn’t be defacing statues and going full conspiracy theorist in a shitty apartment. Bruce asked Greg why he hadn’t seen those checks before and Greg didn’t know. Lex Luthor chose him because his situation would push Bruce, hitting his sense of guilt and powerlessness for not being able to save Keefe, just as he was not able to do anything during the Kryptonian invasion and save his employees.   Think about it, the checks were telling Bruce to open his eyes, that he is blind, that he himself is Bruce Wayne’s ghost and he haunts him. Now why would Keefe think Bruce Wayne apart from paying his medical bills would be able to do anything about Superman? Why would Keefe put so much responsibility on Bruce? He doesn’t know Bruce is Batman, he doesn’t know the personal issues he’s been dealing with. But who does have the means to find out who Bruce is? To figure out what he’s feeling? Lex. And Lex most likely saved the notes for after Wally defaced the statue to match up with his writing. And Bruce is dealing with his own personal hell, if he has no reason to suspect that Wally isn’t getting cared for, he’s not going to check. Batman’s obsession was with Superman and his own feelings of rage and powerlessness. He was pretty much having an existential crisis in the film, doubting his whole career as Batman.   Lex has controlled so much of the story. He controlled the situation in Africa, making a situation and making sure Lois would be sent there in order to lure Superman. Then he had KG Beast set up bodies to look like Superman killed them with heat vision and paid a women in the village to lie about it in court. Then had KG Beast kill that woman to keep her from ever telling the truth. He took the criminals Batman was branding and had KG Beast set up THEIR deaths to make Superman think Batman was an enemy. He invited both Bruce and Superman to his benefit for the Library  to not only lure Bruce into hacking his systems so he could learn about the Kryptonite, it was also to get Bruce and Clark to meet and further build tension between them. And he also used Keefe to further turn the world against Superman in the bombing but to also further push Batman. And there’s even more than that. He was using and playing everyone from the beginning. Do you really think he didn’t play a part in the checks?",1
"Waltz is exemplary in every role he’s in, but I have a hard time imagining him as Mr Freeze.  Although, most of the cast in this movie is intentionally challenging the norm of these characters so I’d be open to his interpretation of this character.",1
That’s all I want. Embrace the future people!,1
I know I was.,1
"REleqsing it and shutting the fans up would be the sensible, simple solution.  But WB really are intent on being the biggest cunts possible.",2
"Yes, you'll find I excluded about 98% of the video, because I'm referring to a specific portion of honest dialogue.   If I'd been aware I was dealing with an idiot, I would've just moved along instead of commenting in the first place.",1
Shazam is part of the Snyder universe but good ahead. Keep being bitter buddy haha. And he probably has more going on then you do buddy haha.,0
"That Bat-chin has a life of its own!   Goddammit WB, it deserved its own movie too!",1
Oded Fehr as Ra's Al Ghul? Hell yeah.,2
That is the single dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.,2
> somber  I don' think you know what that word means.,1
"Nope this is WB we're talking about, proven to be one of the most reactionary studios making movies at the moment",2
"Keanu supposedly has a role waiting for him in the MCU, and Hugo seems pretty done with comic book movies. Fassbender would be a good snatch since they killed the Fox mutant films except maybe Deadpool.",0
Damn.. thats correct.   Here's an upvote,1
"Oh true, Wan apparently actually saw it. Forgot about it. Some articles reported that after Aquaman",2
"Maybe it’s just Vulko’s?   And on the costumes, it’s clear that whatever original plans may have been, Snyder chose to go with non-official/final costumes for all three new characters in JL (Flash/Aquaman/Cyborg) to leave it open for the solo film directors to go with the costume designs they wanted as the characters’ “official” costumes.",1
☝️ 💯,2
Nothing beats IJ2's [design](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/5c/fc/5c5cfca0c8f27865b4657535df4106e8.jpg) for me. Helmet's sexy af.,3
"Exactly this. I really enjoy the movie but Pa Kent's death is just so stupid to me. I hate it more than ""Martha"".",0
My hopes for this movie is and I love The Rock and what he's accomplished so far but hopefully Black Adam isn't just Dwayne. I want Adam to establish himself. I want to see the character and his traits come to life. I'm still skeptical for this movie but if Doctor Fate is appearing in this then my hype will go up a little more.,1

Trashing the studio will only hurt his chances of appearing as Cyborg again. Not the most diplomatic approach,0
"Sheer and utter bs. If they wanna get political in a damn comic book movie, then they might as well participate in actual politics at the Senate.",0
Let’s not post un-reputable sources or reposts here. This is a report and spam from me. No offense.,0
"Well this is the reason why WB's flops this year aren't really big loses to them. They've only been covering only a 3rd of the budget or only financing distribution costs just in case the movie bombs.  [https://variety.com/2019/film/news/warner-bros-flops-doctor-sleep-goldfinch-1203400046/](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/warner-bros-flops-doctor-sleep-goldfinch-1203400046/)  “Some are only distribution deals, some are co-financed, so it’s tough to get a sense of how much skin they have in the game.”  If WB were to put out TSC, I would think WB would have Snyder's production company and whoever else cover the bill with only WB just releasing  the movie",1
"Well its not impossible though. I knew a guy, mother white father black, he was pale as the moon, frackles and red hair. He had many defining features of his father for sure, but well,  pigment disorder  is  pigment disorder",3
"You have to be cautious when praising Snyder.  Always make sure to add the old *""I know it's just my opinion...""* or *""I understand that most of you disagree...""*.  You have to make sure that other's are aware of how little you think of your own opinion. If you don't others will do it for you.",2
Then wouldn't that be a plot hole? Granted we don't have the full context and it's nothing compared to the plot holes and inconsistencies in the theatrical cut lol,2
Agree with you and I would like to add an honorable mention from TDK; Batman's first appearance in the parking garage. When Zimmer's score kicks in as Batman bends the barrel of the gun held by the imposter is pure movie gold for me.,1
"Basically, the Variety article was a round-up of all the rumors both present and past with most of the DC movies going on right now, but the big thing that riled people up was it said that the Snyder Cut is basically a dream, would cost too much, and would never happen.  The Forbes article is from a writer who had previously questioned the validity of the Snyder Cut being thing but after being shown stuff by a credible source (probably Jay Olivia) is convinced it's a thing and basically says anyone who says otherwise is irrationally not looking at the facts and/or has an agenda.",1
"Wonder Woman was an amazing addition to the movie and was pretty awesome in every scene she was in. The mystery at the party, the playful banter with Bruce at the sword of Alexander, and her entrance and fighting against doomsday all went well The only JL advertisement in the film was the QuickTime videos and that honestly feels like a studio guided decision Also I don't understand why killing him in the second movie is inherently a problem. It gives actual stakes to the movie and presents real danger to the situations they're placed in. Tony's death in endgame was lessened to me because I knew going in that either him or captain America we're going to die. Civil War didn't seem very high stakes because no one really suffered true consequences from the film. Even Rhoades had his ability to walk artificially restored in his next scene",1
Yeah I know that. I meant he would be comparable to Thor from the mcu. He is not a literal god. His appearance is pretty much a human.,1
Each page is usually a minute so that’s almost an hour an a half of new footage,1
Lol! That’s the only time I’ve been good a superman movie didn’t get made!,1
BLASPHEMOUS!,2
I watched 3 times in a span of 24 hours. Never watching it again 😆,1
This was history lesson first. The same one shown in pieces in London to the press I think.,2
Wildcat and Hawkman castings are really good,2
"Yeah, an old interview that contradicts things he's said before and recently and was done mostly to save face while his standing as Superman was up in the air. Definitely his true opinion!  The SC would change many things. WB releasing it would show that not only do they listen, but they admit their mistakes. Us getting it would finally give us closure. It would signify WB finally learning not to do this anymore. It would give us a better sendoff to Affleck than theatrical JL. Blu Ray sales would make them tons of money.  There is literally no reason not to release it.",3
"I loved the design of ""The Batman"" Harley... just wish they did more with her in that show  though I do understand it was before the Harley fandom exploded",2
"Who knew that when Geoff Johns started the hope and optimism narrative it was the beginning of the end. Remember the interview where he said instead of 2 parts he wants to bring it together sooner? That was probably when the story line was fucked. Mind you, I'm not blaming Geoff here, I'm using the familiarity of this event as a timestamp of the story's inevitable demise. Back when people thought things had just kicked off, it was actually the beginning of the end. WB probably made a collective decision to shut it down, while spinning the narrative as coming together sooner.  Even though Terrio rewrote the original 2 part script with Zack to lighten up the story, coming together sooner was a WB mandate. IMO, neither of these guys knew what WB's real plan was. When they saw the loose ends and Easter Eggs of Zack's cut (where some might even see as fan service), they had to pay an enormous amount of money to remove them. Sneaky fucking bastards, lol. Hopefully Sarnoff keeps her transparency promise because we all know KT had secrets.",1
"I’m not sure. There’s this https://heroichollywood.com/zack-snyder-justice-league-green-lantern-ship/  And there’s been some buzz around an actor, Sam Benjamin : https://twitter.com/sambenjaminnow/status/1197235159847882755?s=21  There’s reason to believe he was Hal Jordan.",1
Because the video is not just about JL. It’s also about JL2! Do you read??,1
"Releasing a Snyder's cut, the way the fans meant it, will interfere with the plans of all other directors working on DC projects right now. First of all, with Ava Duvernay and her New Gods, which is a high budget film, and also with the new Batman trilogy. The rest of the films and ok, but they have proven that they can survive on their own.",1
No red trunks or cloth suit please!   I think Michael Wilkinson's suit design was outstanding. I loved the whole Kryptonian aesthetic that was so wonderfully realized in the opening scene of MoS.,2
"Short answer :Yes. Long answer:Those who fight for this cut, do it because they liked Snyder's previous film, so it's safe to say they would enjoy his Cut. Also, every movie he made that has a director's cut, people say it's the superior version.",3
bullet dodged,3
"While I agree 41 isn’t old, this film would essentially be Superman I. All that happened prior to Justice League etc most likely won’t be mentioned ever again due to its reception. So you can’t really start a franchise with a 41 year old, it just doesn’t happen.",1
"You're right, he's not a bad actor, he's a terrible actor.  I have zero faith on Johnson's ability to do Black Adam justice.",0
I totally get what you mean.,1

"I didn't say they were the same, I said it would be just as time-consuming. Maybe even more. Regardless of what happens to his marriage and his vices, he still needs to pay bills, hence why he has continued to work.",0
I think the lenses need to be a bit more angular. I don't like the idea of something that looks like white contacts. It should be an angular design akin to the comics.,1
You're right. Nothing Snyder made is as bad as Battle of Five Armies.  Okay maybe Sucker Punch. I love Snyder and even I admit that movie was bad.,0
"""yOu HIjAcKEd BeNS moOViee""",1
"I don’t have a Snyder bias,  Dawn do the dead is one of my favorite Saturday night in movie and MoS is a good movies as well.   But there’s a spectrum my friend; it’s not you either adore that director and everything he does or you’re hate him and everything he does. As much I like some of his choices I realize that his model was not sustainable.  You just can’t have a Trinity movie being a laughing stock and dropping 65% on it second weekend (even more worldwide). A movie that opens at $420M shouldn’t be a  “hit in its own way” it should be one the biggest movie of its time.   My loyalty is to these character,  they deserve  the glory and prestige they had in the golden age of the comics. I’m not gonna  be a yes man to a director just because I’m a fan of his. Especially when his track record is problematic.",2
"Of course taken with a grain of salt, but I would like this direction. Show off some of the other JL members, look at the success of WW and Aquaman. GL would be a great opportunity, and I think Superman needs some love as well.",1
WB is making the wrong Superman spinoff show. Tyler Hoechlin‎'s Superman isn't nearly what Routh's was and still can be.,3
*squeaks in MY MAN*,3
"I assume you have problems with James Gordon being black, then? And why not Selina Kyle being played by a hispanic?",1
After all these BtS reveals. I’m starting to understand why WB wanted to cut it up. There was WAY to much going on in this movie,1
That little guy is about to fu*k a lot of shit up! And I don't think people realize how much fun they're about to have at the movie theater with this film 😂,2
Mmhmm you're right about that.,1
Can I downvote this more than once?,1
I mean this looks like a batmobile was their intention. Cybertruck was just meant to be a powerful new kind of truck. Pretty different goals. Both cool in their own way.,3
This is why the MCU is vastly better. Commitment to their plan until the ENDGAME. *pun intended,0
I mean that would work. You avoid controversy and still give an accurate name to the character. Considering this will most likely be set in Egypt naming her Aset is more true to the Egyptian pronunciation,1
That's actually a very good fan cast. Chapeau.,1
This is not a Snyder Cut toy. This already came out months ago and you can find them on Ebay right now. This post is very misleading.,1
So cool that there's a connection! I was noting the similarities between these costumes as well as the differences.,2
Would love that too,2
"Regardless, it's still a sequel to Wonder Woman that establishes it as a kind of person she once was, the line, ""I used to want to save the world."" Which implies she went away, for them to make WW a public hero would kind of be a cop out. I hope those rumors turn out to be false and still remain somewhat consistent in that respect. And while yeah, they're going in a new direction, it still takes place within the DCEU. The Suicide Squad is the same cast basically, even as far as to the same character designs and outfits.",0
Oh my God. Zack you crazy motherfucker. This would have been the most epic series of superhero movies ever and WB fucking ruined it.,3
Why'd you spill yer beans?!,3
I also really like the BvS version with the Kryptonian Joseph Campbell quote running though it,3

Helena Howard if his daughter. Elle Fanning if Niece.,1
Can we get something substantial?,1
"Its not about blaming Superman specifically for his wife leaving. It’s for both showing how Superman’s actions/negligence had lead Wally’s life to being shit, and it makes Wally SEEM more bitter to the point that he could be a Suicide bomber and no one would ask too many questions.",0
Luke Evans is spot on. Maybe because that mustache suits him well,3
They should just turn the thing into a mini series with like 4 episodes. I'm sure they can pull it off.,1

"I think that's not horribly uncommon, but it might be fun for you to learn about the phases of the moon.",1
"Variety said that it releasing was a pipe dream, not that its existence was a pipe dream.  You’re having a full blown breakdown because you didn’t even read a quote correctly.  The Snyder cut can exist and WB can also be 100% sure they’re not releasing it. Both can be true. Calm down.",3

"I get that it's probably one of the more goofy looking takes, but I wish they had at least incorporated more of the original Kirby design. Maybe mix that with the Earth 2 version.  But I take it from this then that this is one of the scenes that wasn't changed much in the theatrical cut.",1
"Both 2 and 3, although his appearance in 3 was quite short.",1
Looks like it’s just a tribute to the suit using BvS models.,3
"That in the DCEU, the Justice League was formed, defeated Steppenwolf and then Batman went into retirement (this explains Affleck’s departure from the role, Pattinson’s casting and his Batman being in a entirely separate continuity a la Joker). Superman has repaired his damaged imagine to the world and is now boy-scouting across the globe but we just won’t see that ever (unless Cavill actually returns to the role).",2

"So I guess they'll go for a 90s vibe this time?

Also wonder what kind of designs they'll go for. Maybe Batman goes for a neo noir Gotham while Joker goes for a slightly updated version of the previous movie's colourful design.",2
Agreed. BvS is a rare case of a movie overwhelmed by its own potential. JL is underwhelming in its intent and purpose. MOS didn’t fall off the rails.,0
# #ReleaseTheSnyderCut,1
I NEED to see this pic in colour. I bet Mera's outfit looks fabulous in IMAX! 😢,2
I wasn’t even aware of that much of the BTS drama. I still thought it was gonna be like the trailers :( I was so sad and disappointed that day. I just felt empty,1
"> I think the scream sums it up nicely.  Sums what up? Having to kill Zod? Him being responsible for bringing Zod here by triggering the scout ship? Him having to destroy the last hope to resurrect krypton? Thousands of people dying during a fight that he brought to earth?  A lot of complex and monumental things happened that day. A single anguished scream doesn't really count as meaningful or interesting reflection on that imo. There should have been some sign in BvS or the end of MOS that he actually still gives a crap about the things that happened that day. Eating his hero cake but dreaming about the horses.  >I he did try to convince him, Batman laid on the guns and the noise machine and screamed in his face!   Sure. But none of those things mean it makes sense that he'd push Batman down a street and then smash him through a building instead of the obvious option to just hold him down and tell him that his mother is in danger. Showing us him trying to reason with Batman doesn't carry water if his efforts to do so are totally nonsensical.  >In regards to this point whether it was coincidence or not doesn't matter. When he picked up the spear it was time.  He didn't know that at that point. He decided it was time for.... reasons.   >We know that Doomsday gets more powerful every time he is attacked or blows off an energy wave. It's already a difficult fight. We don't know how powerful he would become.   Not powerful enough to stop Diana chopping it's arm off. And if you go back and watch it Superman is shown looking in the direction of the fight when she does that without krytonite right before he decides to fly off with the spear. So if you want to argue that he used his supervision to assess the situation then he clearly made a bad assessment because he saw doomsday significantly damaged by WW right before he makes that choice.  >He was about to blow again. Superman would rather end himself than Doomsday take out Bruce.  He rolled the dice on Bruce surviving the first time Doomsday exploded. If he was worried about the safety of Bruce or Lois or worried about Doomsday escaping then they should have shown actually shown that line of reasoning either through dialogue or visual cues. Have him arrive with the spear, see Bruce cowering without cover, see diana struggling to contain Doomsday and *then* decide to fly directly at it.",1

"And yet you just made another Snyder Cut post, as did somebody else saying exactly the same thing.",0
"Fuck this!. If Johns and berlanti are on board to do movies, they will just end up being like marvel driven tones with crap stories where you have to fill the gaps in yourself. Titans is the same and season 2 was such a step down. Johns fucked up suicide squad and justice league with whedon.   Warner are mental... I hope they learn but this just seems like a step down. I hope proper r rated movies like joker continue to be made rather than 'themepark' shit and superman helping old ladies cross the road. Smfdh.",0
"Again, what's the difference? We're never gonna get the Legion of Doom, we're probably not gonna get Darkseid. Plus, JL did wrap up a lot in itself, otherwise it wouldn't have been a 214 minute movie. Even though Darkseid was teased, it's not like Infinity War where it's clearly just Part 1 of a 2-part contained story. JL1 was more like the third book in a 5-book series where most of its own story was self-contained with hints to the future.",2

"Oh, absolutely. I think they _could_ recast, but I don't think they _will_, but my opinion may change if Leto's deleted scenes do not appear in Birds of Prey.   Still, the point still stands that when people picture Harley Quinn with a Joker, it's Leto's version, because that was the version of the Joker her character was designed for.",1

Has he even confirmed the Colin Farrell casting?,2
"Blows me away that some people refuse to see the thematic work Snyder and co put in MOS through BvS. I get how the theatrical version had issues with pacing and the script but the directors cut of BvS is doing so much cool shit. Weird comparison but it reminds me of Kanye in how it’s very artistic but bc of its genre or whatever people expect it to just be entertainment, and not even try to look deeper into things to understand",3
" ""flew over so many heads"" hahaha   He took away one of the greatest Batman's monologues and delivered a piece of shit line.  It didn't go over anybody's heads. It was a poorly written scripted. How can you even enjoy it? We had one of the best battles between two brothers brought to us by Frank Miller and instead we got this shit??? And somehow y'all praise him for it.",0
I really liked him. I didn’t like Returns that much but I was really looking forward to seeing him in the sequel.,2
"Another MoS nod could be ""You're a monster. And I'm going to stop you.""",2
"Snyder said he had shot everything before he left, so likely would not have those scenes.",3
Face/motion/voice  Solved,1
Yes. Which is why this is important. If you read the article he details that he was literally shown proof of film completion percentage and proof of its existence and detailed the behind the scenes drama.   He changed his mind. It is a good thing. It has always been what we in the movement were working for. Knowledge distribution,2
"It absolutely does make it a better movie. Sorry. You’re just objectively wrong here. You can like the movie or not, the UC is a better movie. To say otherwise just proves you weren’t really paying much attention.",1

I feel like Snyder releases some of these photos to clap back at the ‘sources’ claiming WB are calling it a pipe dream and saying it’s never going to be released.   Maybe just me,3
"Yeah I'm not a fan of Whedon generally but this isn't really on him. It was a work for hire role, the producers were always going to dictate what they wanted.  Sure we can blame Joss for some of the dumb stuff he personally added. But the overall product of the film lays squarely at the feet of 2017 WB.",2
What social network is he sharing this?,1
This is in the trailer right?   In the movie they CGI’d the glasses off.,3
Deadline or whoever broke who shes playing and its not Babs,2
Hard to believe it’s the same guy sometimes haha,2
"Yeah I think the point is that he’s not done, there’s just no movies with Superman in them currently in the pipeline. When/if Supergirl starts production I could see them bringing him in.",1
"I still always see it as a Superman film. The entire plot is a conflict between Superman struggling to be a symbol of hope for the world while Lex is trying to tear down that symbol of hope and power either literally or metaphorically. Batman is just a character that gets caught in the middle and manipulated to Lex's ends. But it's still a classic Superman vs. Lex story, just set in a larger DC universe with other DC characters",1
"Yeah. All he did was say Ragnarok is awesome. It's not like he left Marvel on bad terms to go work with DC & this came out of left field. Wasn't James Gunn Tweeting about how great Infinity War & Endgame were *after* he got fired? Directors praise movies they like. Whedon wasn't ""promoting"" Ragnarok. He was saying his friends made a great movie.",1
"Geoff also constantly talked about how DC needs to have more jokes (Even Batman), threw off the course of JL, and killed Ben's interest in playing Batman. I wouldn't be surprised if Geoff's WW rewrites included making Ares a video game villain.",0
That’s usually what pre-vis cg looks like there guy.,1
"> I didn’t put words in your mouth, saying you have no issue with him killing Zod is not stressing that you like the story.  ""Are you really trying to say that because what YOU wanted to happen doesn’t make any sense in this story""  This comment chain started with you saying ""what YOU wanted to happen"" in relation to my comment specifically about the death of Zod. So yes. You did put words in my mouth. I have no problem with the decision to kill Zod or the wider story either. Me taking issue with the storytelling *isn't* me not liking the story.   >Now I’m not saying liking a story means you have to agree with and defend everything about it, but you’re very negative about it most of the time.   I understand that it seems that way but I'm mostly arguing in terms of trying to understand why so many people didn't respond well to the movies.   >You’re always arguing against something about the movie.   But it's always the *execution* that I'm arguing about. Not the story.   >The stuff from you about Zack being able to come up with an alternative to killing Zod was kind of weird.  It was more of a flippant remark to a pretty flippant comment made by someone else here.  >And as for the rest, it’s just ignoring much of the criticism that these movies have gotten.  I see it more as trying to get at where that criticism is born from. And I think the GA and critics would have really enjoyed the controversial choices Snyder made if he could have crafted more engaging movies from them. I've never said that ""save martha"" was a bad idea. Just poorly executed. And when you drop the ball for some of your biggest moments people aren't going to find your movies particularly compelling. It's pretty much a basic requirement for dramatic moments to be dramatic rather than unconvincing or dull.",1
There was a mini BvS comic line that served as a prequel to the film. I vaguely remember it showing Lex using drones to follow Batman and Superman around to help him identify who they were,1
"He did via bvs. It’s critical and financial performance kind of doomed his own plan and consequently, the dceu. I know a lot of people hear love it, which is fine, But many (along with myself) thought it was a hot mess. That’s his fault.",0
3rd in the trilogy and hype of the whole series. Of course it was going to make more. They built a brand of the Nolan movies. Remember Batman Begins made shit for money.,0
I mean that’s true if what the president releases is pictures of a movie he directed. Otherwise that comparison makes zero sense.,1
"> Whedon's were cartoon jokes, even worse than the embarrassing Thor and Hulk in Endgame.  Yeah but at least Thor and Hulk made sense in the context of the story they were telling.  It made sense for Banner to merge Hulk and himself.  He turned a struggle into an asset.  His entire character arc is basically showing how he goes from a total wildcard in that he may be helping or hurting their cause, to becoming basically useless in Infinity war, to then becoming literally their best all around asset in Endgame.  I understand some people may not love how they glossed over Hulk and Banner becoming one, but I agreed with the Russo brothers when they explained why they didn’t film that.  And Thor I actually really loved because it showed just how egotistical he really was before Infinity War.  Like he had gone through a lot of shit in his movies, and throughout all of it he always still held his head up high because he knew he was the man and the “strongest Avenger”.  But letting Thanos get the best of him rocked his world so hard that he became a shell of himself.  Even in the beginning of endgame you see him still having it together because he’s holding out hope that they’ll eventually undo what Thanos did.  Finding out Thanos destroyed the stones completely flipped his world upside down.  But Batman... I mean holy shit where did that come from?  He went from “I failed Superman I won’t let him down” to like a buddy cop comedy character.  It’s like he completely brushed off that he got played by Lex.  If anything you’d expect him to be more brutal with criminals after how Lex played him and instead he’s making small talk on a roof with them.  Literally baffling how anyone at WB green lit that.  Superman... honestly I kind of liked him under Whedon.  Zack did a cool deconstruction of the character, and while I’m not defending what Whedon made him say a few times, it did feel more like Superman.  It was just a lot more cringy than it needed to be.",3
I mean JJ had to work with/for a person who thinks that it's hard to come up with new SW material 🙄,2

He's not the only actor who I think could play the character, but I think he's my favorite choice at this point",1
Suddenly I'm slightly interested in this film.,0
Is this movie made by the creators of Amazing Spiderman 2 and The Mummy reboot? What makes studios think that their audience wants a room of spinoffs. Or a hall of spinoffs. Or an asylum of spinoffs.,1

Super-strength flying heatbeams breathing talking underwater and co are ALL SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES. They don’t call them Superheroes for nothing. There’s absolutely no difference in a suspension of disbelief between seeing Superman fly and Aquaman talk underwater.

They look like action figures lol,1
I am in as well.,1
"The Snyder problem started long before JL. He is a divisive filmmaker that couldn't connect with audiences. He's a visual person, not a storyteller.   They went from MoS to him fighting Batman, to everyone fighting a resurrected superman. They rushed it to compete with Marvel. No amount of footage can fix that.   In came JL. Already in trouble with production and rewrites. That is again on Snyder cause he lead production. So what makes you think JL will turn out differently?   And a 3 hour movie? That's just throwing pasta on the wall and see what sticks. No clear plan.   Whedon was a paid replacement of Snyder both due to the bad reception of BvS and as he deal with his personal life. He was hired to fix an already bloated film and he failed.",1

You're acting like it's super easy to pass on a couple of million dollars,2
"I generally enjoy the film, plot and pacing is good, acting is good. But for me: get a script doctor for the dialog. Make Pa Kent a bit less morally ambiguous. Kill Pa Kent another way, Clark could've survived the tornado and saved the dog *without* using his powers so the scene is nonsensical. Add actual emotional weight to the collateral damage (ala BvS). Have Clark be more concerned with civilians. Don't have them kiss romantically and with a joke surrounded by 9/11 level destruction. Don't have a background character reveal Superman's name (one of the worst details in the movie). Probably more but that's most of it",1
Muuuurray. 😏,1
"Superman is an alien living among humans. He doesn't need to feel represented to feel like he belongs. He just is. He just does it. He doesn't care about that. He cares about about being the best he can be.  I've been the odd man out before and yeah it's not fun. But you know what, I dont care or didnt care enough to force people to think the way I think. I just moved on. Any friends I made were welcomed to stay.  And you are essentially saying the same thing in that paragraph about ""I'm can't relate to people like me."" Doesn't matter what it is. Someone represents you as a person. Not as a color. I'm someone's friend because they are able to connect to me and vice versa. Not because me and them have the same color.   You're looking at things at too complex of a situation. It's really simple when you look at it.  I have had a learning disability but that doesnt make me feel better when I see people with other disabilities represented in shows or movies. Doesn't make a difference at all. Doesn't change my life or your life. Is it cool? Sure. Is it neccessary? Debatable.  Do I want to see Superman with a learning disability? Absolutely not.",1
To each their own...,1
This is so out of hand. Nothing like this has happened in movie history.,1
"If you show all that has come before (excluding SS, not all the fault lies with Leto though), more power to you, but he may get fatigued if you plan on doing this in a short duration of time. Though TDK is recommended.  Alternatively, just touch him upon Batman basics and let him know this Joker movie is about a man's descent into madness who while is not someone you need to root for, is someone whose circumstances you cannot help pity.   1) Joker is Batman's nemesis.  2) He is fairly unpredictable.  3) He does not have any fixed origin and has had varied interpretations across all media.  4) Thomas and Martha Wayne are Bruce Wayne's parents.  BTW, I'm Indian too.",1
"Say what you want about JL, it was at least mercifully briskly paced. Superman Returns, on the other hand, is like watching paint dry.",2
Eh it's just Snyder fans shitting on everyone's opinions.  It's like we're not allowed to want our own version of Superman. Only Snyder's Superman should be allowed to exist. Everyone who disagrees can go to hell.  This place has been this way since a long time. The recent push for the SC is just empowering such kind of behaviour even more.,1
It seems more likely now then ever. I don't want to get my hopes up but it's never had traction like this before. I also think it is far more complete than we were lead to believe.,1

"The whole reason Lex invites them both is to pit them against each other. He invited Clark specifically, Perry calls Clark a nerd for getting the invite.  Mercy even catches Bruce in the act trying to steal information of Lex's servers which is also pretty self-explanatory.  Lex's plan had him taunting Bruce the whole film.  So yep, very much a ""well duh"" situation.",2
how? I mean I understand everyone has opinions and all but what about her could be possibly be so NOT Selena Kyle to you?,3

It is obviously wonder woman is busy tied up doomsday and batman is shooting doomsday with grenade in order to give the perfect opening for supes to impale him with spear  Which would be fine if Superman knew any of that was happening. He didn't. And they didn't know he was coming either.  >Plus you can clearly see doomsday keep building energy after wonder woman chop off doomsday hand so the situations is definite very dire there and no time for supes to keep delaying around.

"This is what Variety says:   >Logistically, however, there’s little appetite at the studio for spending the millions of dollars it would require to finish visual effects and editing work on Snyder’s version, particularly as “Justice League” was a commercial disaster. There are currently no plans to release a Snyder version either in theaters or on HBO Max.  >“That’s a pipe dream,” said one knowledgeable insider. “There’s no way it’s ever happening.”  This is what Hughes says:  >While Warner could indeed spend some additional money to finish a few elements or tweak a few others, Snyder’s version could be released as-is without additional spending and viewers would get the full film with 90+% completed footage, VFX, and sound.  These 2 statements don't actually contradict each other. <10% of a $200M+ film would literally be millions of dollars, anywhere from $2M (1%) to $20M (10%). And even if the film was picture locked (meaning 100% complete), releasing and marketing the film would also cost millions of dollars. So they're both right, but neither add anything new to the existing narrative presented by the trades, which is that Warner Bros. is hesitant to spend millions to release it.",2
60s Batman is clearly the alpha among of all the fight scenes. Snyder comes nowhere close to achieving such realistic and intense fight scenes smh,1
"Apples to oranges. Are you trying to insinuate that War Machine has the same pop culture merit as Batman? Are you comparing Terrence Howard playing a role once to Ben Affleck playing a role twice? Again, if WB felt like they were going to bring back Cavill they wouldn’t have filmed a headless Superman cameo for their new franchise. Spare me the scheduling conflict because if that was the case then the cameo would have been cut out.",1

Synopsis? A disturbed man on the pursuit of power at any cost. His demons slowly consume him as he finds success and potential in every opportunity. Man-turned-machine-- the path of becoming heartless.   Imagine a world where a man constantly warned his people of the coming of aliens-- yet they laugh in his face-- and comes what they believe to be the fall of man and the rise of extraterrestrial power-- of which the man so wants. I'd also be down if they gave it a sub plot where Martian Manhunter (but disguised or shapeshifted into a political candidate-- ordinary human being) would be Lex Luthor's political opponent-- where Lex constantly treated his nemesis as ""an alien""-- sort of have the movie build up to his introduction to the Superman as well if WBs is feeling bold.",1

"It's nice to hear the words ""shared universe"" again and, more importantly, that there is an actual  plan for team up films. . The last time we heard something official from WB was that they are focusing on standalone film, so I think it's great news that shared films, even if it's just with characters in the ""magical"" DC part, are still in the picture.   Hopefully, they will do the same with Batman and his world.",2
"Most people do, according to Rotten Tomatoes, Shazam! got a 90% review, 83% audience score... Aquaman got 66% and 75%. For a comparison Spiderman 3 got a 63% review rating, you know, the one with emo Tobey Maguire. I'd prefer to watch spiderman 3 instead of Aquaman again because spiderman at least has some charm and doesn't take itself absurdly serious. I guess people really like Jason Momoa?  Edit  Here's a pretty good list of the top 50 superhero movies. Aquaman is ranked 35th and Spiderman 3 ranked 34th, so I'm not the only one that felt like these 2 movies were comparably good/bad. My favorite part is that the Spiderman review starts with   >""So this is how you torpedo a franchise""  And it still beat Aquaman.",0
That’s some Nathan Drake shit right there quick turn the image and see if it unlocks the lost cut of Snyder. If not we may have to go to Tibet. Lol!,3
You NAILED that comic book feel dude!  Also this dialogue is a perfect middle ground between Snyder’s Superman and “Mainstream” Superman it you get what I mean.   Still serious but uhm.. how can I put it.. a far superior version of “is this guy still bothering you?”.,3

"It was in line with the theatrical cut in terms of desired tone. The execution of that tone was different. The first trailer gave me a lot of Donner/Jenkins vibes in terms of a serious optimistic tone. Whedon's is more like Superman III and IV (And I'd argue theatrical II, but people like that one for some reason. I never did...). Comedic for the sake of being comedic.  The point of the 5-part Superman story was always to lead into a more optimistic style. And JL was going to be the transition movie.  Instead we got ""Hope is like your car keys"". Again, who let the Quest for Peace writers on set?",1
"I think they're discussing [this](https://www.cbr.com/watchmen-r-rated-animated-movie/) - I wonder if WB are retooling it slightly to be closer to the HBO series (voice cast, slight continuity alterations) so as to act as a prequel. The comic exists already so a flat out adaptation doesn't necessarily scratch any itch that isn't already satisfied by that.",2

">Warner Bros. film chief Toby Emmerich has met with writer and director Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver to explore possible ideas for a sequel to the drama about the early days of the Clown Prince of Crime. Insiders caution that the talks are very preliminary, no deal is in place, and no script is currently being written. Phillips is also eager to make sure that any follow-up meets the artistic level of the original, which garnered strong reviews and Oscar buzz for star Joaquin Phoenix. Initially Phillips was pretty clear that he saw “Joker” as being a one-off.  >Insiders did shoot down reports that Warner Bros. and DC are talking about having Phillips do origin stories for other comic book characters, revealing what went cracked on their trek to the dark side. Any “Joker” follow-up will take years to pull off and DC has a busy slate. ",1

"They even had Steppenwolf roar in that BvS scene, which officially makes him just another big spiky CGI monster. It's just too similar, especially mere minutes after seeing Doomsday on the screen.   If I'm being honest, I don't think the character works with either design. Regardless of how he looks, he's just another generic CGI monster hitting the big screen shortly after Doomsday and Ares, who were both generic CGI monsters. On top of that, Steppenwolf doesn't have anything particularly interesting about him in terms of his character. At the end of the day, I would've preferred they foreshadow Darkseid through an entirely different character.",3

"I'd bet that he doesn't,  that Reeves Batman has his own Batverse but no DCEU connections. I think they learned from their mistakes and are avoiding the Marvel route. That massive expansive story. Maybe a tenuous connection at best, like small Easter eggs. It's hard to have filmmaker driven movies when they are beholden to other people's creative visions for the sake of consistency. So in essence I kind of agree with the pocket universe idea, I just don't believe Pattinson will join the the other DC characters. Just Batman characters. I don't think Reeves or Pattinson would have done it if it was going to be in that Marvel vein with a potential for more than a trilogy. I imagine they have a rather specific story to tell. I don't think we need buildup to get a JL movie. Yes WB needs to get a string of hits under the DC banner to build confidence to fund the movie, but I think they could just film a JL movie that starts with them already established. Without having all the intro movies, like JL Mortal was going to be.",1

"The biggest problem with Dark Phoenix is that Fox had no idea what to do. Kinberg wanted to make a giant two-movie epic that would begin a new era of X-Men. Then Fox saw bad reactions to all the other darker CBMs at the time and demanded one movie with a more triumphant tone. Then Fox decided it was too long and wanted Kinberg to make it under 2 hours. Then the Disney buyout happened and they threw a fit that it was so similar to CM (Even though Dark Phoenix had been in development longer). So then they reshot a ton of it. You can see the level of interest in the actors fluctuate wildly (Except for Lawrence, but she hasn't put in effort since DOFP).     Ultimately, I think what would've saved Dark Phoenix is if it had followed up a better movie. Yeah, I'm gonna rag on Apocalypse here, but with how that movie handled the Phoenix set-up and how DP basically ignored it, there was a lot that just went nowhere.     Thing is, I think that Apocalyspe could've been that Phoenix Sage Part 1 if they had focused it on that more, and Dark Phoenix as the Part 2 would've been received better.     It's one of those movies that I can see the potential. The script is good (Kinberg showed massive improvement from his X3 days), the cinematography is great, the finale actually being on Earth in a regular location was refreshing after so many space finales. It was definitely better than X3 and Apocalypse if you ask me. But at the same time, I can't ignore how Josstice League'd the movie got by Fox. Kinberg was so enthusiastic about making a dark epic (AKA exactly what the Phoenix/Dark Phoenix Saga was), and it saddens me that given the reception this film got that Kinberg may never direct another film in his life. There's a reason Claremont himself looked so positively on it, he saw underneath the rewrites that his story was still there.     All I can say is, if it exists somewhere in Fox's vaults, \#ReleaseTheKinbergCut",1

It’s simple,  Snyder couldn’t deliver a homerun DC movie for 7 years between Watchemen MoS and BvS. And a right after he got the boot WB delivered 2  widely embraced billion dollar films in less than year.

That's the difference between Wan and Zack. Zack wouldn't have the octopus playing drums and it isn't about suspension of disbelief. It's about world building.   The DCEU used to be relatively (the key word being relatively) grounded. Kind of like how GOT was grounded fantasy. Like the supernatural stuff was still there but there was a mystery and realistic aesthetic about it. It's a sci-fi universe but the individual elements have internal logic preventing things like octopus playing drums.  Anyway I miss when we had this identity. A grounded comic book world. Not the dark Knight which is our world with Batman but the actual comics written with similar logic and rhythm as our world.,0

"In my opinion there's a clear bias towards Batman. It's built as a Superman sequel yet Batman name's comes first in the title.

Surprise, surprise he wins and gives him a speech about how much better he is. Batman's my favorite character but I hated how Superman was treated in that movie.

They're not going to market it as 'Justice League', they'll market it as 'Justice League Directors Cut' or something, with full intention of making people know this is not canon and not how they want it to be played out in the actual canon story line going on now.

"Dune is a official project and he can speak openly about it because of that. Answering a question in a interview isn’t the same as directly promoting a project. He’s also not doing social media promotion for Dune.    The Snyder cut is not official.

Either way it’s no huge deal. He personally may not agree or want the attention from that.",1
Not really JSA will mostly be supporting cast like how the Shazamily were to Billy.,1
"That's the ""problem"" with The Dark Knight as well. Heath Ledger stole the spotlight at every one of his scenes to the point Christian Bale was overshadowed and his arc by the end felt like a subplot.",1
Go for it man. Drop it and move on with your life. Let other people do what they want.,3
Snyder: I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.,1

In my opinion Rises is a worthy finale.,2
This doesn’t make any sense.,0
I remember seeing him in Transformers. Guy is funny as hell.,3
"Jeesh, I wholeheartedly wish it was as simple as you’re making it out to be. Affleck eventually confirmed he was done as Batman. WB still has to directly release a public statement (like what they did in regards of Joker’s press premiere. And no, surprise surprise that wasn’t from *a source.)*  No one here thinks its just around the corner dude. But sure, if simplyfing things to make SC fans look stupid makes you sleep better.  The people you’re claiming to deliver  “ThE biTTeR trUtH 😫👌” said in the article that JL “needed reshoots”, which got debunked by Jay Oliva (yknow, worked on the film, might know something) not too long after. So much for the “truth”, this is as “truthful” as the “it doesn’t exist, its fabled” thing people loved to parrot last year.",1
He considered PEDs but planned to do it natural.,1
"This comment section is so shit. Smarmy and obnoxious from both sides of this conversation. Snyder sycophants and haters both fucking suck. The movies were good.. they weren’t everyone’s cup of tea. We will hopefully have 3 movies of Snyder’s Superman if this HBOMax rumor comes to fruition. it is time for someone else to carry the torch. If they want to do this, fucking go for it!",1
No sequel is needed.,1
"Generic CGI monster??, and what we got wasn't?. You're loco.",0
"Yes, because wanting to feel represented and included by your society is being fragile...",0
N U T,1
When the NDA stops and that’s I believe( in this case around 10 years) then WB might actually address and release this movie.,0
The DCEU suits never got black. A dark blue yes but never black.   A thing I notice is some people never consider how blue is going to look in daylight and at night. The light blue some people desire is going to look too bright in the morning and out of place at night.,0
"He was supposed to be training in secret, introducing us to Arthur who hates being Atlantean yet still loves one of his people and wants to learn his own ways, even if he has no direction, just to establish Aquaman's combat training. Then Aquaman would have delved into their past, itself why Arthur sounds so cheery to see Vulko again, we were supposed to have seen them together already.  Since it was cut out, we just assume Aquaman was always a skilled badass until his solo gives us his origin. Snyder had thought to at least show why Aquaman is a fighter, whereas the theatrical cut now makes it seem like he gets trained only when he loses the first fight against Steppenwolf.  Necessary building blocks were shaved off. Ares's original design in WW before it was changed heavily resembles the ancient Ares armour of the 5000 years ago battle. Snyder had *introduced* us with world building but was gonna let the solo directors do their thing. But due to the aversion to Snyder, all of the buildup was changed. Vulko was removed entirely, same with Iris (presumably setting up the Flash movie headed by Rick Famuyiwa).  Basically, #ReleaseTheSnyderCut",2
"Why? How?   You say that it doesn’t apply to other movies so why does it apply here?  There’s literally no consistent logic to what you’re saying, nor is it based in the content we’re discussing.",1
"Nope, no fuckin way. He can't even finish a screenplay and his own character arcs.",3
"1. So Darkseid was supposed to be wrapped up in 1 movie and Steppenwolf in 2? Sounds made up and not based on reality but okay. And of course he'll say ""it's crazy"". He got told he couldn't do it.  2. Anyone involved with BvS and the backlash it got would make proclamations about next one being optimistic and so on.   You're giving way too much credit, blame and power to Johns based on rumours you've heard. Typical.  3. They actually are. I've seen Watchmen. The movie that copied the novel page for page and missed the entire point of it by a mile. Good thing we now have a show that gets what the novel is about beyond ""it's so dark and edgy!""  4. I'm pretty aware of it but that only works if you believe he was gonna become the character people know him to be. I don't believe snyder gets or likes Superman and hence never would have let him become that.  5. I'm literally going off on his past works and words but you do you.",1
"A Todd Philips DC cinematic universe would be akin to something Christopher Nolan would have done.  I had heard, though, that Nolan's scenario was the other way around.  WB asked him to oversee a DC universe of films and television, and he turned it down.  I feel like if WB was smart (and they're not) they would build off of what Phillips just established, even if Phillips steps away.  Hire writers and directors that share that same vision, and then build out a DC cinematic universe that not only stands in stark contrast to the MCU, but is great on its own merits.  But the cynic in me says that'll never happen.",1
"Hell, it’s the same on certain sites as well. I know a guy who convinced himself that Snyder’s doing this just to satisfy his ego. Seriously, the guy freaking lost his daughter and watch his work go to waste. Any artist would be pissed if they were in his shoes.",2
"...Why would there be a Thomas Wayne Flashpoint Batman? That's the one that indicates this is fake, also the BvS Steppenwolf didn't appear in Snyder's Cut at all.",3
"The core of the character is hope, that didn't changed until the New52. I like what Snyder was aiming for, and did you miss the part where I said I like MOS? I really like the end of BVS too, because that showed us the hope he's supposed to inspire. My opinion isn't clouded by what came before, I have watched every version of Superman and Superboy except for the musical, read an astounding amount of the comics. I love what Shuster and Siegel created, I love what they intended him to be, a symbol of hope that can overcome any obstacle.  I'm not sure why what I said is getting downvoted, especially with my own admittance that Snyder was going there and was stopped by studio meddling, and that I liked MOS and BVS. Hell, I even want to see the Snyder Cut released!",1
"I don't love it, but considering what we got...",1
"wait Henry doesn't have the moustache here... and this was the scene towards the end..  edit: apparently it's spelled mustache... ive been spelling it wrong.  edit #2: and I guess the moustache problem took place during the reshoots, and this scene was shot in the initial production?",3

"He did announce it though. In October 2016 filming had finished. Picture lock (meaning edited into a timeline which won't be further edited and past the ""assembly cut"" stage) was established as being done in January 2017 at the time. What he screened wasn't his assembly cut. He screened it in January. He was past that stage by then which is why Kevin Smith's insider was able to make claims about the cut.   If you were following Zack's posts you didn't have to guess. This has been the most infuriating thing about this. The willful ignorance. It was never mythical. It was never hard to get evidence. It was never hard to use common sense but because it was Snyder people jumped through hoops and performed all sorts of mental gymnastics to believe literally anything but the truth. Imagine hating someone so much you willfully engage in deception and promote it as fact. You take the word of some ""inside source"" which remains nameless over Zack Snyder himself? I'm not exaggerating when I say some of the worst behaviour in our society was on display here.",2
I mean...  Calling the Snyder Cut a pipe dream isn’t the same as calling the idea of WB releasing the SC a pipe dream.   Sounds like WB brass is perfectly fine with not releasing it right now.,2
I loved Lex's puns. They were actually clever.,3
there's no chance in hell that they would have a DCEU and NOT include Batman in it. And there is even less chance that they'll have reeves batman not be in it and a 2nd batman be in it.,1

I don’t want to be the one that compares marvel with DC t what marvel does right is managing the character development of the marvel universe. I mean dc does alright but they just all don’t make sense in the same universe. Because of that they don’t really have a long guarantee in the movie universe.,1

True and same with you too btw on being biased. And yes we will see.,0
And there will be lens flair,3
"In case anyone was wondering, if you’re familiar with “All The Gods” t shirt design that Zack released highlighting his Superman plan... then the image should stick out.   And now, with that Stunt video coming out, another image was revealed in that, of which I also captured.   When placing both images layered, they were almost identical with how everything was arraigned. And that is what you’re looking at above. 🙂",2
"Too early for The Joker.  MoS is not my favorite and it did not age well for me, giving us a very boring Superman just because Snyder though making things ""dark"" will play out. It didn't   BvS... Ugh where do I even start... Just no. That movie is not good.   I'm excited for the DC to step into post-snyder era. It will be much more successful.",2

But rewatch every single Batman film and every time he hits or otherwise injures someone, I want you to pause the movie and consider what that injury could do to someone IRL. Then for each one, think how likely it is that someone would get severely injured if that damage was inflicted on them by someone with the training and hardware of Batman.  Then reconsider if you think it's ""living in a dream world"" to imagine that people never die at Batman's hands and (more to the point) that you've never seen him do anything onscreen that would lead to a death that he could have prevented.",1

"So, did you miss the whole part where Batman gasses and then beats the absolute dogshit out of Superman before nearly harpooning him through the face?",2
"Idk, I'd say Into Darkness is still closer to MoS than this, which just looks overly bright. Hell, even Donner's Superman feels less distractingly bright than this picture (Mainly because it has a softer image. Which I personally wouldn't be against, but after people raged about the 4K release of Superman 1 being too soft and grainy I don't think it'll be well received). Honestly I had no problem with MoS' palette, it had a nice range from darks to lights. It actually looked like a real city rather than the overly lit green screen New York Avengers 1 had (Which is why I'm glad the Russo movies have a more tempered palette similar to MoS).",0
I do remember people posting about it on this sub after the dvd came out. Don’t remember seeing it outside this sub though,1

">Ah. a frequent response from someone who got their Batman history lesson from a YouTube video.  This sentence comes across as gate keeping and a little insulting to me. Fair enough if you didn't intend it to be either of those things.   The reason I believe it comes across that way is because  you dismiss the other person outright, by assuming a higher position based on your personal level of expertise with the source material.   >Look, you can’t deny it’s the truth with some people, youtube and Wikipedia is their history lesson with so much left out and catered to preference that it’s nearly impossible to have a legit discussion. Pointing that out is hardly an insult, rather a reality check. I’m just not afraid to call it what it is.  I agree that not everyone has the same amount of knowledge in regards to the comics and a character's overall history. But I think it's important to be welcoming, and to try to educate someone through meaningful discussion. If the person becomes rude, and doubles down on their incorrect assumptions, then it's okay to move on as that person is not willing to adjust their world view when presented with new evidence or may just be a troll. As fans we need to be welcoming to each other and accepting of each others opinions about characters as well.",1

I'm gonna say some unpopular shit here but I'm ok with a sequel and I hope they do as many of those joker movies as they can as long as they have good story ideas.  I'm kinda ok with joker staying in his own parallel universe away from the justice league and all that. In a live action setting sure he can fuck with batman by exploiting his moral code but nowadays theres no reason batman cant just call up flash or supes and joker would be put away or dead in seconds.,2

"I always wonder what's wrong with telling a clear self-contained story. Why should we have whole Superman trilogy before something interesting starts to happen? Snyder had 5 films clearly planned out that were tied together with Superman's arc. Why we need solo trilogies for each character before they form Justice League and face a big villain? People are so closed minded that they only see Marvel's way as recipe for success. Snyder didn't want to do anything like Marvel does, that's why he had planned self-contained story and then very likely be done with it while other filmmakers  would do whatever they want.  It's like complaining about LotR trilogy not exploring every character in spin-off films. (Oh and they killed Gandalf in the first book, only for him to return in second. Hmmm.)",1

"Did you happen to miss where Superman died for a world that hated him, betrayed him, and completely turned their backs on him?  That to me, is incredibly inspirational.  Doing the right thing regardless of who approves or not, willing to die unaccredited.  Also, the message of ""if you seek his monument look around you"" was beautiful to me.  We don't need a Superman to save or destroy us, we can help each other, if only we cared enough.    Once the invulnerable God is put in the Earth like the rest of us, that ideal of Superman is heard.  He had to earn the admiration of the people.  So the problem isn't that Snyder missed Superman, it's that audiences have become used to Marvel's version of a ""superhero"" and reacted strongly to something that was being its own thing.

"Its not at all. Man of Steel is Earth One, BvS is Superman from Birthright/For Tommorow. JL is pretty much a caricature of Superman.",3
"You're basically just trying to silence the Snyder movement.. That's how it starts.. Giving people the option not to have Snyder means you're not supporting everything he stands for.   You have to remember, with the exception of the black label properties like *Joker*, this is the Snyderverse, I think you're in the wrong place if you don't want to hear about him lol.",1
This is perfect.,1
Doesn't look anything in line with his movie. You believe what you want to tho.,1
I blame WB as well but no one forced Whedon to accept the job. It's not like he needed the money. Since their plan was to marvelize DC if the Avengers director said no where would that leave WB? I think there is a good chance they would have postponed the film until Zack could come back and they couldn't as easily spin their B.S. narrative.,0
"I watched it with my friend while high off our asses. We just couldn't stop being in awe at that it existed. ""Wow, it looks like they worked really hard on this... but it's *aquaman*...""",1
The SC doesn't hurt any of that though. It's not like they're getting rid of all t hy e WIP movies and saying they're just going back to Snyder. It's just releasing something they already have done so that people will finally have closure. There is absolutely no downside to releasing the SC.,1
Keke Palmer. She 🔥🔥🔥🔥,2
Yeah and he said he didn't want to have a conversation about the movie. That he just wanted to make it but a movie who touched these themes does that to start a conversation and make people think. Makes me think he lucked into it,1
So excited for this,1
I need Helena Bonham Carter in more things,3
As long as its an adult Lex and not Jesse Eisenberg...,0
What negative stuff did Snyder Cut fans do? He mentioned it breifly in the sticker like article. What have we done besides believe?,1
Nope Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet are her parents,0
That's valid. If he doesn't want to participate that's up to him. I wish people would just stop harrasing him about it.,3
It really doesn’t look any different than Suicide Squad. Just has more of a ‘fuck Jared Letos Joker’ vibe. Lol I wonder if he will throw a fit over this movie too.,1
Wow really? Wait he had a suit in BvS ?,3
"Yeah, this is exactly when I realized there was more going on than what we were told.",1
Knowledge is Power,1
The only people who talk about him being out as Superman are the fans.  I see everyone saying to let him be Superman and give him another chance.  Literally no one official has said that wasn’t the case.,0
Not as Superman . Fuck that noise,3
That's the whole point though! It's supposed to be similar to the comics we've all loved reading whilst growing up.    Without those key elements of familiarity this is simply another run-of-mill chick flick! lol,1
"The DCEU is going through a soft reboot right now, with those R-rated standalone movies like Joker are gonna be separate from the DCEU.",1

"Granted that's embedded as their features.  But giving a bunch of monsters from a planet called apokolips human features is hardly outlandish or attempting to be true to the characters background. I mean, not at all cliché is it??. Especially the one we got!. Let's give everything human features shall we while, we're at it?.   Martian Manhunter, he is intended to look alien as is Kryptonians to look human. Steppenwolf is intended to look like a menacing being from another planet... Humanising the features makes it look shit and unimaginative.",0
"The runtime, the CGI, the story, its all so weird and I’m surprised someone like Joss Whedon was involved",2
At the very least it will have the color scheme of the early trailers. That's a massive step up from the visual vomit of the theatrical cut.,3
A society that abandons and treats people like trash!,2
A black villain? Are you trying to imply african americans are evil? /s,2
agreed!,1
You mean that depiction of him when he has grey skin all over him?.,2
You'll believe a man can shave.,2
My personal vote is Kirk Langstrom/ Man Bat. Pretty compelling story.,1
"While I prefer Steppenwolf look more like the comics, I think this is a really great design that’s in between Snyder’s design and the comics. The armor looks great.",3
"???  I know, that's why I said they removed that part and changed it to Bruce bringing her.   They say they added more stuff for Amy and she appears to literally have less to do than she did in the trailers.",1
So what did mean then???. Lol keep circle jerking.,1
The thing is that Pattinson is not even athletically built righr now.,2
Phoenix hates doing franchises though. He has never done a sequel.,1
"> And think about it again ... he was also keeping Bruce from knowing that Wally wasn’t getting them. When Bruce asks Greg “why haven’t I seen these?” And Greg said he doesn’t know and they are working on it, THAT was Lex.   You’re just assuming this lol.  There’s literally no point in having a discussion about this if anytime a plot hole in your theory comes up you just say “that’s Lex”.  If you’re right about this theory, then it was executed miserably and without any thought to how such a lie would unfold in real life.  That’s the bottom line.",2
"This. People who are thinking of subscribing are wanting to because of what they know they would get, not something tha hasn’t even been teased by WB.",3
"I doubt Ezra Miller's support for RTSC will make a difference because he isn't all that valuable to WB. Miller's performance isn't as universally acclaimed and he hasn't proven himself as a bankable solo lead. In contrast, WB would care more about Gal's opinions because she headlined Wonder Woman to great success. Miller isn't valuable enough that WB would care about his opinions. The harsh truth is movie executives only listen to creators that are useful to them.",0
"Honestly Luke for the most part. He was always my way into Star Wars. But I also found the furthering of Rey and Kylo pretty interesting.   I don't care for the ""side story"" of the Resistance pretty much at all. Finn, Poe and the rest are lost on me.",2
Everywhere you look in the DCEU there is wasted potential. I didn't like Leto's Joker but I think they could have saved themselves and made a great movie if they done something along the lines of 'Leto's joker is actually Robin after the original Joker drove him mad'. I think that would explain a lot and give them the opportunity to cast a new Joker while also fitting in with the story.,1
Wrestlemania 32 was the beginning of the end for me. Thank God for AEW,0
"All these puns and references, using Greek mythology and etymology during the Gala speech etc cleverly suggest how well read, well informed and genius Lex is; instead of using other characters to constant refer to him as a 'genius' or a 'mastermind' which is a trait in many movies. Some of the true characters of a genius are to remember all that he has read and seamlessly use that in daily conversations in different ways and that was very well depicted.  Also by doing this, they put the audience in a position to be smart enough to get these references.  I was mesmerized by the writing in this movie, especially Lex's dialogues and I was bummed when my friends didn't share the appreciation.",1
"So they did ADR and had the pre-viz back in January, the VFX must be at ***the very least*** the level of theatrical-cut Steppenwolf, wouldn't it?",3
"pretty much. I don't think it will be a bad film, but it looks like a terrible comic book movie",2

Sigh.  When is everyone finally going to realize they’re not starting in January?  Think March.  At the earliest.,1
"Be sure to participate, folks. It lets you vote even if you don't have a Facebook account.",1

This article feels like Kroll having his way with the fandom.,1
"I mean, to be fair the Joker doesn't fight Batman physically and in the Arkham games (one of the best versions) he's around 50.",1
"1. Just because it's in watchable states as Momoa claim doesn't mean it's finished. There need to be a lot of editing, CGI and sound mixing not to mention the score might need change as well. These thing are not come free and it would cost a lot.   2. Snyder era already over and you guys need to accept and move on. DC are go with different direction and a lot of cut content in JL can contradict with their future release.  3. There are high chance Snyder cut gonna getting even more negative feedback and with DC slowly coming back. That is the last thing they want.  4. There are high possibility that JL Snyder cut is instead of give Snyder fan closure, it will spark another of their movement instead... like going back to Snyder direction or demand studio for Ayer cut. Which again not something studio like to bother with.",3
That’s not how this works. That’s not how *any* of this works? Are you not familiar with the comics at all?,1
"I apologize if I’ve misused the word. Whatever it would be called when you change something about a character or a story or even a world. That’s all it would be. A single change, for whatever reason it may be, does not mean the film is in a different universe. Creating a string of connected movies isn’t always going to be a perfect process, there will be missteps and creators have the power to make changes without it being proof of a disconnected.   I know it’s fun to get in, to connect and believe and people want clear continuity, but at the end of the day we all know a movie is getting cast and being made- and with that some inconsistencies may arise from time to time. Again, not perfect, not ideal- but certainly not proof of anything other than these movies not being real life and me potentially misusing the word retcon.",1

"In his original incarnation, Khem-Adam was the son of the Pharaoh Rameses II. One of the Pharaoh's high priests, the wizard Shazam, is impressed with Adam's good deeds, and gives him the powers to become his champion by speaking his name. Adam serves as Egypt's champion for centuries until he is corrupted by Shazam's evil daughter Blaze, who convinces him that the two of them should rule Egypt. Adam kills the Pharaoh and appoints himself ruler of Egypt. Shazam is enraged by this and strips Adam of his powers, encasing them in a scarab necklace. Adam's de-powered body rapidly ages and he dies. Shazam locks Adam's corpse and the necklace inside the tomb of Rameses II, where it is found thousands of years later by Theo Adam, an archaeologist, and his companions, C.C. and Marilyn Batson. Theo Adam becomes obsessed with the necklace, and kills the Batsons in order to steal it. After Billy Batson is drafted to become the wizard's second champion, and Theo Adam sees that Captain Marvel looks exactly like C.C. Batson and the lightning bolt on his chest was the same as the one in Khem-Adam's tomb, he realizes the power of the necklace, and speaks Shazam's name to become Black Adam.  He tells Billy that he killed his parents, and they fight. Billy defeats Adam and de-powers him by taking the necklace. He takes Adam to Shazam, who wipes his memory and steals his voice so he can never say his name again.  In the New 52, Aman is a slave who is transported from his cell to the Rock of Eternity and granted power by the wizard Shazam. He uses his power to save Khandaq from the Seven Deadly Sins and then vanishes from history. It is later revealed that Aman had an uncle (who helped Aman escape slavery), whose name was Adam. Adam was injured during their escape, and when Aman was chosen by the wizard to be his champion, Aman shared his power with Adam to heal him. Afterwards, although Aman wanted to use his new power to help his people and cure his former slavemasters of their evil souls, Adam only sought vengeance against those who had enslaved them. To this end, when Aman called down the lightning, Adam seemingly killed Aman so that he himself was the sole recipient of the power. However, the details of Aman's ""death"" are not shown, leaving his fate open to speculation. Black Adam refers to Aman's ""sacrifice"", and tells Billy that he will go to any lengths to ""free this world from those who enslave it"".  The rest of the new 52 origin story for Shazam goes just like the movie, except replace Dr. Sivana with Black Adam. Billy shares his power with his foster siblings who fight the Seven Deadly Sins, and Billy fights Adam alone. He realizes he cannot beat Adam, who is more experienced using Shazam's magic, so he changes back to his normal form. He convinces Adam to do the same so it could be a ""fair fight"". Adam is convinced, but upon returning to normal, he rapidly ages from the millennia and turns to dust. He is eventually revived by Khandaqi revolutionaries to be their champion again, in the *Forever Evil* story line.   These days he's more of an anti-hero than a straight up supervillain.",3

"Junkie revealing he finished his JL score was HUGE. We already knew from the production timeline and a few telling remarks that he was well into the scoring process, but learning he finished it was a bombshell for many fans.  It truly is. I remember when such information was far less centralized and alternate and complete scores/cues were largely hearsay and fan dreams. We have had absolutely zero indication elsewhere that Junkie scored SS in parallel with Price.  Didn't know of their involvement in JL, but it doesn't surprise me. The eleventh hour nature of Elfman's involvement cannot be understated. It was an unenviable position, and I'm sure he needed the help to make the deadline.",2

No new movies for while, Joker hype seems to have died down. So right now this is the topic. We don't tell people to stop flooding this form with Pattinson related stuff.

This was only in the UE so only people interested in the Blu-ray caught it I think,2

I don’t think any of you read the article. First of all it’s just a pitch. There are tons of pitches sent to studios that don’t happen. Remember that Garett Evans deathstroke movie? Lol me neither. Also the article specifically said MBJ has moved on because the project would take too long to come to fruition and warner bros are still looking at all prospects.

That'd actually be really good.,3

I’m so hyped for The Rise of Skywalker",1
"I see why they changed his design to a more human look, because the one in BvS, concept art that's online and this previz, he looks like a monster and would probably just be seen as another Doomsday.  On top of that, their reasoning might have been that you, as a viewer, can't really see him emote because of that look, but the version we saw in theaters was thinly written, so it didn't really make a difference.   I don't know which one I would prefer. Maybe a cross between the two of them or a more polished version of the film, but having another monster figure without any sort of depth to it that just wants to destroy stuff would have been really bland.",1
"Because the director's cut was never released and had been totally ruined. If it had been left alone we wouldve had a different result,,good or bad.

Like y'all kept saying for Affleck being out until the day it was confirmed and made people who were in denial look stupid,2
I predict to you be  But you need more than that to beat marvel. DC is very close to beating marvel.,0
"If they do another joker movie, I hope they go the multiple choice option for the jokers origin and do a different story.",1
Well people said joker wasn't possible without batman. Venom wasn't possible without Spiderman and here we are both movies outcrossing the main hero movies,3
"Why wouldn’t they make more solo villain movies after the success of ‘Joker’? And it’s hardly as if that’s all the article is suggesting. It talks about R-rated movies in terms of ‘The Suicide Squad’, not just solo villain movies. And they have the option for spin-offs if characters are received well. I think it’s unfair of you to complain about them being reactionary when the article talks about Flash, Black Adam, Green Lantern and Superman as future movies, not just more ‘nitty-gritty solo villain movies’.",1
There is no way to improve upon Cold cold heart.  I don't think remaking a story already on TV is worth his time.,3
TIL that a WB insider thinks a lot of high profile professionals in the film industry have a pipe dream about the Snydercut. LOL,3
That would be perfect?,1
Same. Came here to say that ahaha,3
Why can't I  *c o n s u m e*,1
*What killed the dinosaurs?*,1
"Well this was earlier this year/near the end of last year and it didn't go anywhere. Since then MBJ, who is a totally overrated actor, has had his plate full with other projects. Variety is just reporting of old rumors and stories and compiling it with new stuff. I mean, isnt it odd they dont really talk about Black Adam, Shazam two or even WW84 much, if at all.",1
Take a look at Hail Caesar. He's really funny in that movie.,1
"what are you talking about? Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam.. have not been ""Dark and gritty""  i dont understand people like you who keep saying that, then you completely lost me with Schumachers bullshit",1
Now we have to find him a new director.,0
Isn't he that comic guy from. Transformers movies??,1
All major blockbusters have reshoots or some form of pick-up shots so I highly doubt that.,0
Movies about genies where people make wishes can go fuck themselves.,1
How is it a waste if it’s a present-day Hawkgirl? It would’ve been a waste if they showed her in the past and never mentioned her again. Unless they go the reincarnation route.,2
I would go for a more mature Hal but yeah this is solid.,1
I NEED TO SEE THIS.   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
"Agreed, I enjoy them both and feel fortunate too. There’s more to look forward to, more content, more flavors and less strain. As you said, it’s fair if someone doesn’t like one or the other for their particular merits, but the rivalry thing makes the most sense at a corporate level, I see no reason for a fan rivalry, especially as opposed to support from a fellow fan base who are the most likely to understand how it feels to be a fan and be excited about these hero movies.",1
This is what the next superman movie needs to be,3
So...this again...,2
"He was great in the movie, too bad the material was really dumb and not explored in any meaningful way",1
Pretty straightforward what I said. What are you confused about?,0
I'm hoping it's called Joker & Harley with exactly this.,1
"Awesome edit!   I don't know how I feel about the curl, though. It doesn't look natural on Henry Cavill, which is a shame as it's the only Superman-related thing that he doesn't have naturally.",3
So he can just freeze the stairs and waltz into the Batcave?,3
"It's a point of controversy for fans. People like to laugh at it, and hail it as horrendous... I don't see a problem with this?. Maybe you may need to think about getting over it?, or ask yourself why this seems to be such an issue for you?.",0
Today was like a pre-Christmas. I dig those bat-goggles too. They just make so much sense!,3
Did you get depressed by this? LMAO new generation gets depressed by everything wow.,1
"Variety , LMAO , nope !!",0
Oh man His design in BVS was definitely going for a realistic approach cause I can picture Aquaman looking like that if he existed in the real world.,2
Boo him! Boo this man!,1
Hinted? He outright said that version of the character was not the way to go and he wanted a more optimistic and hopeful take,1
"So you saw the cut then? First it didn't exist, then it needed $$ to be completed... Now they won't release it? Keep trying hard and keep moving the goalpost.",1
We don’t know if Reeves Batman is a different universe. The only official confirmation we have is that it’s DCEU.,1
"Facts hurt, I guess.",2
That's our Superman!   \#ReleaseSnyderCut   Gimme that MoS sequel with Brainiac that we've all been waiting for!,0
Hell yes that's good casting. I retract my other suggestion.,1
I’d bet some good money she’s just going to call everyone ‘box office poison’,3
Like you said yourself it’ll be a soft reboot so yes you are starting the franchise again. We forget that Man of Steel was also divisive although I personally loved it. So I don’t think there’d be anyway they mention any call backs to that film,2
Batman is with Superman.,1
To be fair that was the OG Director's Cut which we're not likely to get   The OG Theatrical seems to be cheaper to finish and at 2:45 hours it's not bad,1
All-Star Superman,1
"He’s awesome, love him, would be great",1
Interesting. People were theorizing that snyder talked to the cast about hashtagging it but this suggest he didn't unless Cavill refused which would be damning.,3
"Fighting terrorists in a mall doesn’t sound like a world shattering canon inconsistency to me, but again we’ll see.",0
So Aquaman just randomly going to the Motherbox temple for no reason makes sense to you?,1
"Calvin Ellis. He’s said before if he plays Superman, it’ll be that version.",1
it’s more of a studio vs trade war.   I think there’s obviously talks of a sequel but neither WB and Phillips will  announce such thing until after the Oscars. THR probably jump the sharks  hoping that WB will confirm but instead they used Deadline to counter reports. It happen often.,3
"I don’t get paid to teach you some basic human decency, so no",2
"Whedon can be good if he works on TV. His MCU movies aren't really interesting, and JL is just an abomination.",1
"Nice article. Good news overall. The only negatives being Superman (and Cavill) being in limbo. And that Flash being delayed yet again. 😑but, it’s hardly Surprising for both. I just was really hoping for some traction by now.",2
"Kickass is a great movie, I don't know why the comparation should be negative",0
I'm actually down for that,2
"Oh nah, essentially the owner / admins just compiles information on RCP scores. Since they have official sources in RCP -- meaning they know Zimmer and other RCP composers -- they're also a source of unreleased information themselves.   How they release is entirely separate to Hans-Zimmer.com. They're essentially sold and traded in a ""score black market"", which are then leaked on the internet when they lose enough value in said circles.",1
Announcing it now hurts it’s Oscar chances.,3
I think that batfleck having such a short run saddens me more.,3
"She also did Selma and When They See Us, both of which were brilliant.",1
"Yeah, something isn't adding up.  Dude will direct the new Superman movie, imo. I mean, his childhood friend and longtime collaborator Matt Reeves is doing The Batman. Figures that WB will pull from these guys to revitalize Batman and Superman. That 500 million dollars is going to be used, people.",1
Like why did he only post it on vero. If it’s real and proves the so-called Snyder cut is real why just post it on fucking vero of all places?,1
It's not a spam. They liked this post.,2
I love MoS!,3
"And now they're calling him like Peter Parker was doing to Happy in Homecoming.   ""Hey, Todd! About that Black Label you mentioned a while back. We'd like to hear more when you have the time to drop by the office. XOXO""",1
What?! Oh please release them both! Junkie and Snyder would make my heart burst with joy.,1
"""it turns good men, cruel"".",3
"(just my theory mind you) Maybe this is part of why no Cavill hashtag support ? Gal and Jason are safe, so they can hashtag all they want. Ray is on the oposite side, maybe he feels he's out, so only has the SC as his ""legacy"". WB may have given Henry hints that he still has a future and don't jeopardize it.",1
This is who I’ve always wanted Ava to cast! Love his voice in the animated film. As a big fan of Brooklyn Nine Nine it’ll just sound Captain Holt in Darksied’s body.,3
HELL YEA,1
Yeah this one looks actually like a bat mobile compared to that boxy one from Tesla.,2
Then go watch the Donner Movies.,3
"Superman being nice? Doing wholesome things? Warming your heart? Showing humanity in doing small acts of kindness as well as great ones? NO! HE SCOWLS NOW!!! LIKE A GROWN UP!!!  Honestly, this is why we can't have nice things, because people like the other commenters here are genuinely repulsed by them.",3
This should be the Snyder Cut Blu-ray cover if it ever gets released,3
Not gonna happen but it would be amazing,1
How is he in serious roles?,1
"Umm, Snyder fans love WW and Aquaman. Which don't have the same tone as BvS. Shazam! Gets a bit more shit because it's more immature style of comedy tends to not work with some people. I like the movie, but people have the right not to like it. And that's not because it's not like the Snyderverse. Hell, Freddy in the movie is essentially a giant Snyder fan. My point is that there is no criteria for a ""real DC fan"" other than they like DC characters. Whatever their opinions on tone are, it doesn't matter.",1
Sllllaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyydddddde,3
Christian Bale and Ben Affleck were the same weight in Batman Begins and BvS.,0
"When I saw the title about *Man of Steel* aging well, the first thing I thought of was the Sears product placement.",3
"One of the few things of his vision I don't agree with. Talking underwater is fine, these characters were meant to lol",1
I mean that is how it works. Imagine if any of them said during JL promotion that the film was bad and nothing like what it originally was and all the reshoots sucked. Good luck keeping the role or even getting hired by other studios for anything,3
“Vibe Check”,1
"Ugh, that's how Nelson was attacked and Cavill was scrutinized as well. We discourage militant reactivity from all sides of an issue here. Tribalism of any stripe is a recipe for cyclical conflict and willful ignorance.",3
See I can appreciate why they kill Silas but it really sucks since he's one of the few cast members Cyborg has,1
Surely not now.,3
I wasnt talking about social media. And it has an uncertain future but yes it has a future.,0
The true colors,1
And honestly all that needs to be done is an hours worth of getting a piece of green cardboard set up as a background and film Lennox reacting or looking pensive.  Just composite whatever background plate was surely shot during production.,3
"I'd love for a Man of Steel sequel to be titled ""Man of Tommorow"". Would keep with the ""Man of"" theme, and would be a callback to the comic series that had the same name.  Edit: Also I wanna see Braniac as the main villan in a Superman movie really badly",3
I see Mark Hughes is back.  At one point he was one of the “three is no Snyder Cut” people.,1
"haha cool, I'm glad the artist put her in anyway- that's the 2002 one!",1
"I think the scene in the sex traffickers place works because its our first showing of batman and if he exits upward like the light, it could show that even though hes ""fallen"" he still attempts to do good even though he's fallen. At the end it all comes together about his redemption. Just my 2 cents though. Well written op.",1
I wonder how that movie us going to go. The Scoob! Trailer looked prerty good. I wonder if they are still gonna do the Hanna Barbara shared universe thing.,2
"Yes, we do. We need to complete the Superman arc in our movie shelves.",0
"How exactly would that conversation go?  Keefe is an emotional guy who can't control his impulses.  If he could, he wouldn't subject himself to 40-years Federal prison.  He wouldn't desecrate a Federal monument in broad daylight in front of law enforcement.  He could also make his point without getting violent, resisting arrest, or making threats.  He's a hothead who blurts out whatever he wants to say.  He swears at Lex as the first thing out of his mouth.  He's vulgar and angry when he tells Finch about his piss.  When he's questioned by Soledad, knowing he's on camera, he can barely keep it together... raising his voice, bringing up blood and war, and decrying the nation's hero.  This is not who Lex would pick to reliably lie.  Much less be able to motivate Wallace TO lie.  He can't buy Wally off.  If money mattered to Wally he wouldn't have tried to deface Superman's monument in a way that he gets caught.  The legal bills alone are going to bankrupt him, not to mention being convicted and going away for 40 years.  Wally cares more about the message OVER money, which is why it's plausible that he'd return checks to send a message... and why he's a suitable patsy for Lex's plan.  If Wally was money motivated, then no one would believe he'd send back checks and no one would believe it was Wally and then he's be a terrible patsy for Lex's plan.  The story itself makes no sense in terms of a superior narrative to get him his aim.  Kahina proves that death gets you in the door.  Why would Lex tell Wally to give UP on the ACTUAL death story to replace it with a lesser living leaving wife story?  With death there's no hope of reunion.  With leaving you can always reconcile... there's hope of restoration.  Finally, the lie is faulty in its ability to actually hold up.  Kahina's story is already covered up three times over by Lex's conspiracy, the Nairomi government atrocities, and the CIA's classified involvement... it's impossible for the Senators to verify her story.  Plus the motive is given to us expressly... she was paid.  For Wally, it's a crazy story to say, ""My wife and daughter are alive and out there and I'm angry at the separation.""  When the wife can be DEMONSTRABLY PROVEN to be dead!  Moreover, there's a time differential in the story.  Keefe puts the departure AFTER he's dealing with the loss of his legs (""Half a man, can't even piss"")... meaning she left BECAUSE OF the legs (or, more likely, his seething resentment over their loss).  If we're suggesting she was actually killed during the BZE, she'd be MISSING during that part of his story and he'd be unable to corroborate.  She wouldn't have come to the hospital, checked him out, and dealt with his limb loss to be witnessed by anyone or others.  She would have disappeared day of the BZE with no corroboration.  Again, what would the conversation between Lex and Wally be?  How could Lex convince Wally to make this completely arbitrary, inferior lie, that subjects him to perjury for what?  A chance to confront Superman?  To talk before Congress?  Kahina got that with a death narrative already, why would a lie get him these things better and without subjecting him to criminal liability for perjury or discrediting his entire story once the lie was caught.  Plus there's the problem of Wally's attitude towards Bruce.  If the boss saved his daughter's life TOO... no matter how SELF loathing Wally might be or angry at Bruce for other things, it's hard to justify sending his angry checks to Bruce if the man saved your daughter's life.  It doesn't matter if you believe Wally actually did it, what matters is that Lex believes in-story that the WORLD will believe Wally was angry at Bruce enough to return checks and write notes.  That story completely fails to track if Bruce saved your daughter's life!",2
"Yes, I know, it's from the theatrical cut, but Zack shot that part, as opposed to any mustache-less Whedon reshoots.",1
Back to the same old agreement of not every movie has to mirror the marvel movies. Lord of the rings and hobbit movies didn’t have 10 movies before then for each character. They wanted to tell a story with those characters,3
Also surpassing Captain Marvel's $700 million overseas gross as well.,3
Thanks. It's awesome to learn that other people enjoyed this movie as much as I did.,2

No I think you're missing the point I was making. However we can agree to disagree.,0
"Are you DC’s publicist or something? Jeebus, you’re arguing over subjective bullshit just because you have a different opinion than mine. I don’t only care about comic accuracy. I just haven’t seen anything that makes me want to see the movie. It’s not my job to just blindly throw money at a movie because it has a comic book label stamped on it. It’s *their* job to make me want to. They haven’t.",1
"Where is it messy?  What exactly is the problem going forward with either where we are now or after Snyder Cut?  At what point are the past movies canon on not canon, where do you start from?  They did it right as far as I'm concerned. MoS and BvS wipe the floor with every Marvel movie. Sure some of them do some great stuff Infinity War for example.",0
>That’s 2 major trades.  It really sucks.   There's your answer,2
WW was more profitable than BvS. Joker is more profitable than BvS and MOS combined. The 50 percent argument doesn’t even make sense considering they worked with multiple production companies on all the DCEU movies.,2
i don’t think this is a shot from the film i think someone on the production took it,2
I'm sure she'd do it if they paid her enough money to. After all Chris Pratt did when he was cast in Guardians of the Galaxy.,1
Honestly I would love nothing more than Michael Ironside to do it or the voice at least,1
"ENDGAME not infinity war E N D G A M E. Inifnity was great, no doubt.  No problems with civil war?.  - the avengers were fooled by a guy in a rubber mask posing as Bucky, even with all that facial recognition tech and clearly would have been fake it fooled them?. Dumb  - BP constantly popping out of nowhere, dumb.  The ending was the worst way to develop it, having a security camera in the middle of nowhere in 1993, when before you can see there is literally nothing in the surrounding area, it was like a last minute addition before it went to cinema. It was an outrageous sequence. It was one the cheesiest marvel has done.  The character logic is stupid, vision can pick up Thor's hammer but can't apprehend a single avenger going against him, like Hawkeye, falcon, or even ant Man. Hell, he just take them all on and hold bucky. It's the most ridiculous concept execution marvel has done. But hey, it 'looks cool' riiiiight??.",0
"It wouldn't be limiting like that, though. They have full creative freedom to do what they want as long as they're within a determined budget that doesn't compromise the quality.",1

i'd take james wan any day,1
"To me, Infinity War isn't technically an Avengers movie cause it focuses on EVERYONE. But still great.  And I don't think it was Whedon's call to make those drastic changes. Everything I've read, WB wanted to do a 180 and make a lighthearted, cheery superhero movie instead of maintaining the course Snyder set. It was probably under those conditions Whedon had to accept the job.",2

So it’s fan art.,2
" >What this sounds like is just that you didn’t like his story.   Even though I've stressed the exact opposite?  >Because we’ve already showed how it makes sense, and you just came back with just “it should have been better and made MORE sense, and if it makes sense then it doesn’t matter anyway cause it’s still bad”.  But it’s not bad storytelling if you don’t like it or if you don’t get it.  It's bad storytelling if people don't buy it. And my argument is that with better execution/storytelling people wouldn't have such a problem with it. You wouldn't need to explain to anyone why it makes sense because it would just make sense in it's own terms.",1

I’m a DC fan, and if I didn’t know who the cast was supposed to be I couldn’t tell you who was in this movie besides Harley. It looks like a group of random club chicks and their hip “aunt” who tries desperately to relate and pretend she isn’t pushing 50.

Even after BvS he still seemed to want to try being the awesome Batman he was. It was only in the Whedon shoots where they wanted him to be Tony Stark where he lost interest.",3

"How much a character talks is not indicative of their character development.  Clark doesn't say one word in the Zod death scene but you get a complete wave of character in that sequence.  He has been forced into a no-win scenario, and went with his instincts.    This still causes him deep pain however, and lets out a cathartic cry.  Of course Lois runs up and he goes to her which shows his loyalty to Earth even though it came at an almost unbearable price.    It's called challenging the character.  If you think that Superman should be given easy ways out and not be tested than you don't have faith in Superman.  It's that simple.",0

clown and Queen,2
"If they went by the comic, he never really died. Just went into hibernation while his body repaired itself. Coincidentally, the older he gets, the less vulnerable he becomes. My take is maybe Green Lantern shows up and brings his body back to space to absorb unfiltered energy from the sun. If not, then who knows. The dirt on his casket floated at the end of BvS so like I said, I don't think he's dead anyways.  What is crazy to imagine is if they didn't remove Zod's head, he may have regenerated, too.",3
It’s a different movie entirely,3
Can I propose Arnold Schwazeneger (or whatever it's written) To this role???,1
"> I remember when such information was far less centralized and alternate and complete scores/cues were largely hearsay and fan dreams.  Are you familiar of a fairly infamous leak site starting with F? It went ""down"" the other day and attempts to automatically download malware now. I'm quite concerned to see how leaks operate going forward, as that'll decentralise the community quite substantially. In general, I can't say I'm a fan of how scores work. OSTs tend to be preened, people are forced to pirate just to listen to large portions of the music, and entire scores collect dust. It's a shitty way for music to be released, and it's irksome that there's not enough interest in scores to warrant proper releases for 99.99% of scores.  > I'm sure he needed the help to make the deadline.  For sure. Age of Ultron and Justice League are eerily similar in how their scores were handled. Whedon had finished scores ready to go, and instead chose to bring in Elfman at the last minute to rewrite the entire thing. Even if he did use Zimmer's themes, I can't imagine that the end result would have been too good. A lot of famous composers nowadays employ additionals too, and the amount Elfman used wasn't egregious at all. The first Pirates of the Caribbean was actually completed in 3 weeks with a team of 9 composers.",1
i get your point but i truly think it can reach the billion mostly if the movie got good marketing and good reviews but for now Reeves never made a real bad movie and it seems he worked so hard on Batman i have faith but let's see,1
"It's a damn shame.  The problem nowadays is that everyone needs to agree on these comic book films.  They must achieve a 95% on RT, they must make a billion dollars, they must be loved by the mainstream.  It's a business oriented, formulaic checklist approach.    Sorry, but that's not for me.  When I think of Batman and Superman I think of mythology, not popular celebrities.  I expect a story that's a product of our world.  I expect a cinematic tone.  I expect narratives that challenge our own issues in the modern world.    Zack was the only one with the balls to do it.",1

"I know right?! The upvotes feel undeserved. And same for other posts about details in BvS that ""everyone"" got. Should I start posting details now?   Maybe I'm jealous. Sue me",1

"No, I don’t. The MCU movies are hardly comic book accurate, but I love them because they were still done well. They looked fun. They handled the changes well and made sense for the adaptation. Even for all the changes, it still looked and felt like The Avengers. This doesn’t look or feel like Birds of Prey at all. Most of the characters were all but unrecognizable. The trailer was generic and boring. The real question is, why do you care?",1
Well he's still in so we might see him get better,1
He is literally shown to have fair skin colour since the beginning,3
Yeah there's no doubt there lol,2
Henry doesn’t care lol,3
"Yes, he looks like he can make adults pee their pants. I asked some of the people who aren't away of superhero movies to tell me what they think of this creature, and all of them gasped ""Oh god"", they said they were scared and wouldn't want to see it again - they were all adults, one of them my mom.",1
"yes, he has fantastic voice",3
"If you can't look at your own comments and see when you did that, then I feel sorry for your self awareness. I am giving you examples of what you said and you refuse to listen.",1
Still a profit and was only the second movie on the series. Beat all the phase one marvel movies except the Avengers. All about progression and build up.,0
Stephenwolf is a god tho so making him look like an alien made no sense.,3
"Wow, that is actually a very good pick ! How did you come up with that ? I think he would rock as the joker !",1
"When I saw that finale shot of Bruce standing over his parents bodies I knew it, I just did. PHOENIX WILL FACE BATTINSON down the road.",0
"I mean, sure. It could perfectly be like you said.  Then again, I did read about a screening of a version of the film where  [POSSIBLE SPOILER]   apparently Diana is powerless for most of the story and so she doesn’t draw too much attention on her. Then again there’s the whole shiny golden armor, which is visually as stealthy as a grenade, but who knows how it’s gonna play out.",0
They could make the second part as a graphic novel or animated movie.,1
"I lolled so hard at this, I feel you haha",1
There's no way Zod was leaving Earth.,2
"> It's quite common for a movie to end and us not see the verbal reflection a character has on what happened. Especially in the sequel if it's months/years later. We've been through the journey with them. A lot of it is implied.  A single anguished scream isn't a journey though. And in no way does BvS imply that he ever thought about the monumental events of Black Zero. Obviously we can assume he must have. But there's little drama or sense of journey in that. And starting BvS by reminding us how disastrous his first day way and having him in no way mention it during the film was a pretty bad call imo.   >Batman wasn't go to listen to any reason.  Then why bother to throw him around at all? Why not just rip his head off and be done with it if he was beyond all reason? (joke--ish)   After Superman smashes him through the building and the bat symbol he still attempts to reason with him ""Stand down! If I wanted it you'd be dead already"". But there's a difference between him attempting to reason with Batman and him making a *believable* attempt to reason with Batman. His efforts are just so nonsensical that people didn't buy into it.   >Superman was watching when Wonder Woman cut his hand off but then he swatted her away like a fly and then continued to grow and become stronger about to release another wave of energy.  He swatted her earlier and she just laughed it off. If she was supposed to be incapacitated by Doonsday eye blasting her then they probably should have shown a half second shot of her unconscious or at least struggling. (And I wouldn't be surprised if they'd actually filmed such a shot)  >Why does that line of reasoning have to be verbalised?  It doesn't. I just explained in detail how it could have easily been shown visually.   ""Have him arrive with the spear, see Bruce cowering without cover, see diana struggling to contain Doomsday and then decide to fly directly at it.""  >Why do we need to see Wonder Woman cowering? It might have made it better for but for me I simply don't need that.  Because you would have had a moment of effective visual storytelling. You'd have no need for conversations like this where you explain to people why Superman had to sacrifice himself. It would just be there as part of the movie. Superman's dilemma tangible through visuals rather than assumed because her being incapacitated makes the most sense.   >Did you see what the shockwave did to the city on top of Lex-Corp tower? The shockwaves were very powerful.   But we also saw WW and Bruce being able to withstand a much more powerful wave that the lex corp one.",1
"I was saying on another post how i think an Arkham Asylum movie would be perfect more then ever now, they would be able to showcase most of the major Batman villains during the film and hopefully even bring back Joker for a smaller role during it.",2
"Seriously, how the fuck has she not been punished for this?!  Atleast recast her. Won't be hard to find another actor of her type for this role. I would personally try to get Anya Taylor-Joy in the role.",1

Wasn’t Johns writing before the reshoots?,1
"you're right, Kevin Tsujihara was forced to step down earlier this year. So I guess there's really no reason (expect money) to not release it. I used to joke they'd release it for the 10th anniversary 8k edition but hell, it might come out with HBO Max",1

Either The JSA or Isis and Hawkman. All I hope is the storytelling is great and we root for the characters that are in the movie. I don't need another JL miss (character building wise)  Already devastated by BVS's somewhat bad reception and Josstice League.,1

"Pretty much all of Zimmer's scores employ additional composers. Man of Steel was worked on by Zimmer, Andrew Kawczynski, Junkie XL, and Steve Mazarro.  Batman v Superman was Zimmer, Steve Mazzaro, Andrew Kawczynski, Junkie XL, and Benjamin Wallfisch  Wonder Woman was Rupert Gregson-Williams, Andrew Kawczynski, Paul Mounsey, Tom Howe, Thomas Farnon, Evan Jolly, Halli Cauthery, and David Buckley   Justice League was Danny Elfman, Geoff Zanelli, Pinar Toprak, and T.J. Lindgren  Aquaman was Rupert Gregson-Williams, Andrew Kawczynski, Evan Jolly, Tony Clarke, Steve Mazzaro, Forest Christenson, and Sven Faulconer",2
Why can't both trades just get a simple direct quote i'm so sick of Insiders Say this and that,0

"I feel like it’s more Humor than News, so that’s what I went with.",1
Yeah this is where this theory completely loses me.  I don’t see any way someone can spin his wife leaving him because of his legs making Superman look worse than his wife literally dying because of Superman.  Her dying would create more sympathy for him.  Her leaving just makes her look shallow considering they have a child and she’s taking the child from her father.,2
"The hypothetical filter is optional, so it would not be forcing anyone out of Snyder Cut discussions. They would literally be choosing to not see them.",2
Well they shouldnt have done that is what im trying to say. Rewriting half the movie at the stage they were at is obviously a bad idea. Whedon fucked the script with that Bs avengers league. Again most of the blame on WB . I feel like my biased hate towards whedon in general is a factor for me being hard on him but yea.,1
It sort of brings light to the studios missteps (I know missteps is a wild underscore) while also going to be a little disappointing as a lot of the threads will be unresolved,1
"So depressing that they didn't follow that epic feel this had. This painting is so bad ass, and the music cue was amazing.",1
"That's correct.  It's insane what media has come to.  There has been some guy on Twitter posing as an employee of Hot Toys who somehow saw the original Justice League Part One, and Steppenwolf's original alien design was almost finished.    You can't make this stuff up.  Well, actually you can.",3
"And Lois being 'thirsty'. That one hurts more than anything. Seeing Diane Lane and Amy Adams having to deliver those lines is probably the straw that broke the camel's back for me ever seeing that version of Josstice League ever again. And I only watched it reluctantly when it was out on DVD because my then girlfriend wanted to see it. Otherwise I'd still probably not have watched it, waiting for the Director Cut as I did with BVS.",1

"I have yet to see a single one of these sources state any plausible reason for Gal and Ben's supportive tweets a week ago, if the Snyder Director Cut is never ever to be released.

But at the moment, I strongly suspect that they're full of shit.",1

"It will take money to finish, even if all the scenes are shot there are still expensive editing to be done.  They might have to pay some of the actors again to release the movie.  It can really only be released on HBO max and they might worry about it branding their service as a place for behind the scenes and directors cuts as oppised to new high quality content.",2
The movie would still be fucking garbage like BvS?,1

Exactly. Thank you,1

"Personally, I don't think a Lex Luthor movie would find the same success. Joker worked because of his huge appeal to mainstream audiences and pop culture. Lex Luthor doesn't seem to be at that level. That said, personally it would be great to see a political or rise to power movie starring Lex Luthor.   For what it's worth, I think the only villain that could work as well in his own movie would be Darth Vader.",3

It's weird because it feels like they purposely ruined the movie so they could say oh whoops guess we should move in a new direction but all they did was make Snyder a martyr and piss everyone off.,3

I'm just not ready to slam my hand down and say it's not true because I don't know either way.  We don't know when Steppenwolf's design changed but it was after BvS. Most likely late 2016 or later. Why is it so hard to see why they wouldn't have got the designs for the new Justice League Steppenwolf until later on therefore in 2016 they were working with BvS design (which was going to be in JL) until he was changed.  There's a link to sideshow on his twitter page in the youtube video.",0

Mos Superman returns so you get that to look forward to.

I think it is related. As soon as the fake luthor was revealed it went right to deathstroke,1
Disagree. Character actors are natural born chameleons you either have it or you don’t. Anybody can be a Great actor with practice and some talent. Character actors are few and far between. You know the last great character actor we had? Michael Shannon. I don’t need to explain anything else. Except Michael Shannon,1
"It's been a while since I've seen it but here goes.   I hold this opinion because Superman isn't a punch first guy and an essential part of his character is that he can't save everyone but he wants to. The Superman in MOS didn't care about saving anyone. He was a reluctant hero but there wasn't anything on the other side of his reluctance.   I know it's not terribly well regarded but I enjoyed Superman Earth 2. It was all about this push/pull. They made a point to showing that he was so smart and gifted physically that he could have a career doing anything.  Those other careers could have given him money and allowed him to take care of his mother.   Yet he chose to two paths, being a journalist and being Superman that forces him to help people and not give him fame or riches. MOS Superman was kind of a loser/vagabond before he got into Supermanning.   Regarding helping people, Superman isn't a wanton destruction guy. The whole movie there is very little care for civilians or regular people.  I think an essential element of the Donner movie was get introduced to Superman just saving people, no villains at first but he's saving people. In the Donner film died of a heart attack and he couldn't help him but he's helping the people he can. In MOS he totally could have saved his father's life without people seeing and he just doesn't for no reason.  Also ditching his secret identity for a relationship with Lois from jump is kind of a buzz kill as him trying to determine which version of himself she likes is always an interesting dynamic.",1

"1. Literally everyone I talk to in real life (Including complete strangers) at least liked (Not necessarily loved) MoS. Check the RT audience score. Hell even the critic score isn't bad, just meh. Again, it wasn't panned like you said.   2. It did better than Returns at the box office, so that was already a win for Superman. As well, people really overinflate the popularity of Superman now. The truth is the generations born starting in the late 80s either hate any version that isn't like the DCAU or they just don't care. By 2016, Marvel had the trust to earn money off of characters like Doctor Strange and Ant-Man, not to mention great marketing for both films (WB struggles a lot with marketing). By 2015, people would see anything with the Marvel name on it. Superman on the other hand only had two hit movies in his lifespan. So while he was recognizeable, the GA didn't really care enough. So when they saw reviews for MoS, they took that as fact and didn't see the movie.   3. Critics hated BvS. The GA on average thought it was, well, average. Again, RT audience score. And given the ungodly mess of a theatrical cut, I don't blame them. But Cavill wasn't the problem people had with the movie. In fact, the cast was generally praised (Minus Eisenburg). Critics hated the overall tone, and the audiences hated the fact that in the theatrical state the movie made absolutely no sense and they had no idea what was going on (Again, I don't blame them).   4. Again, the problems people had with Josstice League were inconsistent tone, phoned in reshoots, and absolutely abysmal VFX. Not Cavill's acting.   5. I see it all the time online from people who hate Snyder's Supes: ""Cavill would be SO good with someone else writing"". Or any variation of that sentiment. People like Henry Cavill. They like him as Superman. What put people off is what Goyer, Zack, and Joss all were doing with his Superman. Granted, the whole point was to build up to a more optimistic Supes (Just like the Post-Crisis arc...). But people didn't seem to get that when MoS came out, and theatrical BvS especially cut out basically 90% of his significance, making it seem like we were always going to be stuck with a dark Superman.   6. And you know what, I'll admit. The timing probably wasn't right for a deconstructionist, Post-Crisis long developed Supes. In 2013 people were kinda sick of darker CBMs, and especially after Returns people just sort of wanted Superman to feel a bit less sad (Though I'll still say MoS and BvS are 10x more optimistic than THAT gloomfest). But the point stands...   7. Cavill was never the problem people had with the movies. His potential is one of the most praised things. And you talk about a business perspective here, but the flaw there is that despite about 70% of Keanu Reeves movies flopping in the late 90s and 2000s, studios kept giving him money. And we ended up getting John Wick. M Night Shayamalan made disaster after disaster in the 2000s, but he ended up giving us Split. A studio pumped in money for that. Second winds happen, the GA isn't so stupid that they would think otherwise.",1

"I've seen articles where writers actually said stuff like ""it can't be compared to Superman II because that was in a much more polished state.""   There was a ton of work needed to complete that version. The entire Fortress of Solitude depowering scene for instance used stand ins for Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve. There were reused shots from the first Superman for the battle scenes, CG touch ups and inserts like for the prologue (the missile that big the Phantom Zone was completely CG), screen test footage repurposed to act as real scenes, ADR dialogue from impersonators (a particularly bad one being when Superman says ""I'm not a coward, Zod""), and even Richard Lester footage with new backgrounds (Superman climbs out the Statue of Liberty instead of a random window). The Snyder cut would probably require far less work to complete.",1

"For sure, 100%, Chris Terrio in an interview talked about how this film was heavily inspired by Early American literature, among many other things. One of my favorite uses of it comes into Superman’s character and Lex’s character. How they are literally opposites. Down to every tiny detail, their dialog, they way they are lit, color design, and score. Lex is meant to be a twisted ironic representation of Clark.   I won’t get into it because it takes a lot to write out, but the easiest example is in the score, where Lex’s score is literally Superman’s score played in reverse and distorted. This was confirmed by Junkie XL, composer of BvS.   So the painting furthers that exploration of irony, solidifying so many representations of it in the film.  It’s the final cherry on top that just really ties it all together.",2
What Whedon did with Diana hurts the most. He gets this credit for Buffy but has been an ass when writing for female characters for years and years. He was terrible writing for Black Widow and did the same with Diana. He’s the guy that wrote that terrible treatment for a WW film and yet WB brings that loser in to disrespect a female character that was given all the respect from Zack and Patty before.  But you’re incorrect with Affleck not believing in Snyder’s vision. It’s that vision that Ben wanted all along and a major reason why he left The Batman project.,1
"I didn't say he wasn't a good actor.  I said he wasn't picky, which is what I think Grace was referring to; the DCEU can't attract picky actors although even then she's wrong",1
"> Bruce wondered why he hadn’t seen them earlier and his employee Greg didn’t know, **that’s cause of Lex.**  This is literally not confirmed by anything in the movie.  You’re sitting here asking me why I’m getting serious and it’s because you’re trying to tell me things in the movie happened that you have no proof of.  > Much of this is just coming from you not understanding what I’m saying. I mean earlier you thought I was saying that Wally went along with the lie to make him look bitter enough to be a Suicide Bomber when I wasn’t. I was saying Lex manipulated him without him knowing what real purpose he would serve.  Yeah because your comments have consistently made no sense and I literally wrote that to try and clarify what the hell you were trying to say  >And again, you’re taking this too seriously. I’m not trying to say this theory is real. I was just going along with it, seeing how the theory could work, what it could mean. I’m not twisting things for some malicious reason or to troll you. Just theorizing. The stuff about Bruce and Lex though, I’m serious about that.  And I and many other people have spent way too much time telling you it doesn’t work at all.  If you want to keep going with it, that’s fine.  I’m not spending my Saturday continuing the single most unimportant plot point of this movie.",1
"Well the woman from the village was paid by Lex to lie. Wally lying could be used to make his story more sympathetic and paint Superman’s actions is a worse light and making it so that he could have a better chance of being allowed to testify, getting the bomb into the courtroom.",0
The New Gods movies is being made by the person who made Wrinkle in Time...,1
"Wait, *where* was there more for Amy Adams and Diane Lane to do?   They replaced one Lois & Martha interaction for another, cut most of the Clark & Martha interaction (going by what Cavill said happened after Clark's return),  and completely removed Lois' agency - being brought by Bruce instead of running to the park.",3
"Not a comics reader, but ive seen Doctor Fate only in Young Justice. I absolutely love his outfit, his magic, the music that plays when he arrives, and his storyline. He is not a big part of the show, but one of the coolest imo.",3
Very much so,3

Bubbles are to talk in private. Explained in Aquaman.,3
"Cinematic, not trash TV",0
You can't say I'm not part of that camp. You do not dictate what I am or am not apart of. That is trying to be the thought police. I even said that there are few ones o am looking forward to them. Just not all of them or alot of them. And you dont speak for everyone. Get over yourself.,1
A sequel is confirmed.,1
Utter shite is exactly how I'd describe that.,0
>resign him to direct more movies   Dear God no please...,2
Thanks (I'm into VS Debates so this comes up a lot),1
Meanwhile Tim Burton's take on redesign was a terrible one. Glad the movie got cancelled.  https://superman.fandom.com/wiki/Superman_Lives?file=Burton_S.jpg,1
It's crazy how many places this movie is killing. It's not doing over 100m in any of these places but it's  ww earnings is still double the us total.,3
"a list of villians for a movie not including Mr Freeze , aint nICE.",3
"Lol, yeah Spider-Man needs a quad bike for when he's tired of swinging",1
How many times can I upvote this??? FINALLY Dr. Fate!!!,1
"I don't think it's fair to say it only did well due to lack of competition. Movies don't make a billion dollars unless audiences are strongly behind them. And Aquaman also didn't have an amazing opening weekend, if you recall. It made 67 million domestically its opening weekend, which was the lowest of any DCEU movie at that point, and lower than 90 percent of MCU films. It wound up making so much money because it had incredible staying power which was likely helped by good word of mouth. People genuinely liked the movie. Even without China it grossed $858 million, which is a huge amount for an comic book solo film, especially one with a character like Aquaman who is not an top tier A-list character.",1
So just have Pattinson do a one off movie and keep Affleck as Batman in the DCU.,0
"I’ll give it this since you’re praising it for its uniqueness, making it feel unlike any other movie. I honestly can’t think of any movie with such a plot-moving character as *insert random explosions*  So eloquently well crafted into the story. Makes the transitions almost seamless.",1
The version in the movie looked really thin to me.,3
That was really well handled by Jesse. The blogger was being a tool.,2
I'd much rather see him as Icon,1
I love Snyder’s aesthetic. I also love Wan but an Aquaman movie from Snyder sounds so good.,2
"You know, Vulko is still in the JL poster.  They just enlarged one of the background characters standing next to him to block him out, but you can still see a small part of him and his trident.",2
Agreed. Kebbell has a gloom quality in him while Lightray is total joy. And you kinda made me wanna see him as Orion now.,1
"They didn't use all the scenes Whedon shot, either.  Additionally, a lot of what they kept from Snyder was re-edited and changed visually (effects and color timing), so even if technically shot under Snyder's direction it was also altered. Look at the differences in the final battle against Steppenwolf as compared to the first SDCC for several examples.",1
I generally agree though in this case we’re talking about a seasonal CW crossover gimmick where the whole *point* is to reference previous continuities and franchises.,3
"Because WB is hiding Snyder's cut and people want it and any information that comes out of the woodwork is jumped on. Doesn't mean any of it is true, doesn't mean it isn't either.",0
"Yeah, I own a personal time machine :)",2
"It could be possible than WB are moving TSS to some point towards the end of 2020, maybe a new release date could be announced at CCXP?, filming will be over in around a month, it's not vfx heavy movie so between finishing filming and the current release date is around 20 months, it's possible WB and Gunn decided to move it to something like October 2020 so Gunn can then go and make GOTG3.",3
In iceland? That's where aquaman was hanging out in the bar.  So there was another extended fight scene?,3
Depends on which version. The Theatrical Cut is a mediocre Batman movie with Superman in it. The UE is a great Superman movie with Batman in it. Superman is literally the core of the plot of the movie and is the catalyst for everything. I think Henry was just trying to get people to shut up about how Dark the movie was.,3
"JSA, so hot right now.",3
make him black you bigot,1
Well that does seem reasonable.,3
">These are standalone stories that don't play into the main narrative.  For the most part no comic takes place into any main narrative outside of events, this book is part of main continuity and Bendis continues parts of it in his Young Justice Run.   King likely views it in the same way, it is in continuity. Superman does stuff like rescuing cats out of trees.   >They aren't like you reading Superman Comics on the norm and within the pages you see him doing shit like saving cats and helping old ladies across the streets.  He does do it, not super often because there are 80 years of superman comics and they don't need to do it all the time, but superman does stuff like rescuing a dog from a burning building, or finding the time to find a child's lost toys, because the small things are important too.  >The comics don't go there cuz the shit is boring.   The comics do go there, but again, it's not that frequent because it's been done alot and when you have a superman comic out every week, it doesn't need to be done all that often, but if you're claiming superman doesn't do smaller things in his main books, you're wrong.   >If it's on screen it isn't going to make the audience lose their shit or it be memorable.  If superman does more touching and personal things, it's going to help audiences form a bond with him.",1
"The problem here was that they didn't take the time to not only introduce but also make us love  these incarnations of these characters.  The first Avengers film worked so well because every one of those heroes had been properly introduced in at least one solo film(two in the case of Iron Man) or as a supporting character in another film.  By the time they got to the group team-up fan anticipation was high.  Justice League felt rushed, like they were trying to play catch up with the MCU.",1
"I have a similar opinion about George Clooney as batman. I thought Clooney could have been the best actor to play Bruce Wayne if put in the right situation. He was tall, handsome, had a great voice, and he could portray bruce in a way that didn’t come off as pompous. I thought he was as close as you could get to a real life version of the cartoons voiced by Kevin Conroy, which I love how Bruce Wayne is portrayed. It would be cool to see him reprise the role of Bruce but in batman beyond. Also, I think it would be cool if Terry McGinnis was played by asian guy. Obviously have to change his last name but I think that would be a bold choice.",3
This is old and of course smells like PR for their company. Snyder Cut as we heard has a lot of different stuff so yeah it can change what we got in our minds.,2
"You're right, I should bail",2
You’re saying the Black Label isn’t official...DCEU isn’t either lol.,2
So....,3
Find someone that looks at you the way Cavill does with Affleck.,1
Which character is the person in the blue shirt?,2
I think they listened to his pitch and it was blown out of proportion.,2
Mark Hughes was once with the others saying it didn’t exist.   He has seen the proof that it does which he wrote about a couple months ago. Soooooo yea. He’s pretty damn reliable.   Ohhh and variety and THR quote NO ONE from WB ever. Just saying they wont comment or saying someone in the film world called it a pipe dream. Soooooo the guys who asked someone and got a no? Or the guy with first hand knowledge of the films completion?,1
Are you new here or being sarcastic?,2
I want MOS sequel.,1
Hopefully when HBO Max drops.,3
Wow. So cute. Is it just me or does BTAS Joker look like Klarion the Witch Boy?,1
"Right, I meant they each had white in their hair to some degree after the serum. Temples, salt and pepper, or just all over.",1
Batman's conflict wasn't a conflict. If he had been wrestling with the idea of taking a life instead of just... being a killer already... then the scene where he can't do it because Superman is calling for his mother would actually make sense. Batman is over the edge murdering people before the movie starts; that he would pull back because the guy is asking for his mother is a completely stupid plot twist.,0
It won’t,1
I am of the opinion they should have used sign language.,1
It was my favorite movie of the year in 2018. If you like DC you should probably at least rent it.,1
It's one of those things where superhero movies set in the future seems like too big of a stretch for audiences to enjoy but then you have to remember the most popular of the recent x men movies was Days of Future Past.,1
I’m not talking about explanations I’m talking about the tone of the character.,0
Still the greatest,3
"Well fortunately for us, he has a great record of making a good movie and then following it up with the Hangover 2 and 3...",2
Pretty sure J.J. wasn't writing the ending for Lost. Alias would be a more appropriate comparison but it's ending was alright.,1
Man that really is the best live-action Deathstroke suit,1
Forbes and their bullshit clickbait...,0
Same reason you need to comment on it.,2
"“Hey little dude, you got some crap right here.”  “That’s my face, sir.”",1
"And WB SHOULD know this by now after almost 30 years. They have a habit of letting directors have free reign on sequels to successful movies which gave us films like Batman Returns, Batman & Robin, and DoJ.   I should note though, Batman Returns and DoJ are somewhat guilty pleasures for me. I always like to label Batman Returns as a bad Batman movie, but a fantastic Tim Burton movie.",1
Plot twist: He brings back Nicholas Cage as Superman,1
"""One misses the days when our biggest concern was exploding windup penguins.""",2
"Thanks, that was primarily what I was trying to determine. Do you think with a 3 1/2 hour runtime WB could convince theatres to play the full Snyder Cut for longer than just one weekend?",2
"The article also suggests that any movement on the film wouldn’t happen until at least 2023. He’ll be about 41 then. No way they, for all intents and purposes, reboot Superman with him being that old. I think he’s done and has been for a long time.",2
"I wonder if they might go with that young, middle eastern guy from the New 52? I mean, Fate & Hawkman kind of seem like too good of opportunities to diversify the DCEU to pass up",3
I would buy these in sticker form,1
"Nah, get started. What you got?",1

I would even say that her theme song is now as Iconic to her as the Williams theme song for Supes... but maybe that's just me.,3

"No, it's not a piracy site. I can direct you where to download them if you PM me, though.",1
That was my thought too. Or Harvey Dent if he was younger,3
Haha ope! my bad....Sorry about that...it’s been quite a day..I’ll delete my comment.,1
Joker had a make up test clip. Birds of Prey had a smal  clip featuring all actors in their costumes.  I hope we get one similar to BoP with actors in their costumes.,0
I’d like to see Rooney Mara as Harley for Joaquin’s Joker.,3
No he wont.,2
"Obviously, still very cool 🤝",0
Could definitely see young Turturro as Alberto but at 62 nowadays he should be a good Carmine.,2
Then they should had used a different character. Thats changing all of Cassandras character.,3
"Helena is pure awesomeness.   Will never happen, but good lord she would make an outstanding Harley Quinn opposite Joaquin Phoenix's Joker.",1
The jar of piss joke is infinitely better than anything Whedon wrote for this movie,3
"I think it would have been interesting to see a Tim Burton vision of the DC Universe. I liked his two Batman films, and I think Nicolas Cage as Superman could have been as intriguing as Michael Keaton as Batman was: Non-traditional but very compelling.

They don't care about the Snyder films.,1
"Who said anything about masculine?  I used the words ""buff"" and ""warrior"".",0
Ah yes this new management that has begun working with Zack again and is releasing his cut?,1
I still don't believe they're going to make it.,2
"i need you guys to be 100% genuine with me.  is the UC worth a watch? the theatrical cut is one of my least favourite movies of all time and it made me dislike the characters for quite some time. it had the same effect on me that The Amazing Spider-man 2 gave me after watching it.   now, i’ve heard the UC is much better, but i mean, is it true?",3
"Perry is a non MAIN character, Diana is ambiguous, and Aquaman is....well. Aquaman. Superman, the KING of superheroes is too BIG a name to race change. Unless its a Multiverse Superman, you'll be upsetting MILLIONS of americans and some fans worldwide with changing Clarks skin.",1

Can u imagine that shit LOOL,2
"Goddammit, we could have had more DBZ. With the Supes trilogy, we could have seen these grander, larger than life battles. MoS amped up the realism. Future films would have amped up the scale. Seeing Ultraman or maybe Superman Lex, whew lad.",3
I have a question.  Do you guys want elseworld realistic origins of DC characters that take away all the comicbook magic?   I just knew if Joker makes money it has to get a sequel.,2
"I'm obviously talking about the interview. They didn't just pull it out of their ass, right?",1
"LOL Don't underestimate Sonic too!   But personally, while I'm happy with the redesign, that movie still looks shit to me.",2
"  >Either ignore that real criticism is warranted or get salty when it’s pointed out. Your choice bud.  You say, having just blamed him for:  >- justice league - 2017 40% (still credited as such)   That was not his movie. The credit at the front means fuck all - that was **not** his movie. Of the movie we saw, slightly less than 40 minutes was his, and a lot of even that had been fucked with (like how the Memorial Park fight was edited to be in the day rather than at night for instance).  >Heck, it’s more likely that JL would have been better received if Whedon actually had been there from the start. His track record is at least better than Snyder’s.    Lol, did you not see the bit where Flash fell on WW's tits? Or the bit where Diane Lane and Amy Adams had to have a ""hilarious"" discussion about how Lois was a ""thirsty"" young reporter? Joss has made some decent movies, but on JL he did not do anything even close to good work, even on the bits that were 100% him.",0
"every single issue from batman #1 to the end of the new 52, to metal ( ive sort of lost track after this) every issue looked better than the last. Capullo is hands down my favorite batman artist at the moment, and any snyder story without him feels lacking.",3
Shazam's posture reminds me of when he threw that Batman figure at the bold bad guy lmao  So static lol As if The Rock was toying around with a life-size statue of Levi lmao,1
You can have both.  Just don’t need to connect it with every other scene.,1
lol are you serious? he is the fucking source,2
What killed the dinosaurs though?,2
Oh hell no.,1
I'm talking about a fantasy. And it's in the news. Hook him up a lie detector.  Hang him over a pool of sharks. Use the lasso of truth. Because realistically he'd just walk away if I asked him on the street. At least in my dreams I can show someone their own words and say you're not leaving until I get answers.,1
He was cast on May iirc and the post is from february,1
"I really enjoyed her as Harley, and if Leto was in a better movie with a better team I’d have liked him too. I’m excited for this, but not anticipating much.",2
"Because WB told him to keep the film under 2 hours. Whedon at that point knew he was just a director for hire, so he didn't really care. He got the actors to phone in some reshoots, stamped approval to some new FX, and wrote some of his B material for new scenes. Whedon wasn't really given control, he basically just gave WB what they wanted for a paycheck. Age of Ultron and the restrictions Feige gave him there kinda broke the guy, so when he realized WB was doing the same, he didn't even try.",2
"He’s at the top of several people’s lists apparently. That guy is in everything lately.  That may be a bit of an exaggeration, but he definitely deserves it. He’s very talented",2
"The movie had a late Nov 2017 release date, so pushing it would've made the release date most likely some time in 2018, which means that those 2017 bonuses for released films wouldve had 1 less movie with BO receipts.  And to make matters worse, some of those people in charge were also leaving at the end of 2017 so they wouldnt have seen those 2018 bonuses.   All in all, they tried to reshoot half the movie at the ass end of production while not moving the release date.  Insanity.",2
China gave it $300m  The main reason is most people want to watch action movies and don't care about good story.,0
BvS for me.  Batfleck all the way.,1
Superman's dad committed suicide to make sure he got the last word in an argument.,1
"Snyder's movies did very well on home media  BvS made $53 million in Home Media sales  MoS made $112 million in DVD/Blu Ray sales  None of this includes digital purchases  If the Snyder Cut was released and proved popular, it make these numbers and maybe even more",3
"This is the most ridiculous reply ever.  First, tries to assert only teenagers like realistic superhero films. Then goes on to call them “shitty Snyder’s films” as if there’s no bias there. Real level-headed conversation. I’m sure Superman would approve.",3
"Why would it be a Snyder ’s  call? There is barely any Snyder Superman footage in the movie and the little there is has the colors changed to what it was supposed to look like, we have no idea how it would look in Justice League.",0
"Oh, yes, almost forgot that he'll likely make a SW movie too. That could be interesting as well.",1
"Yeah? It has a new lead as Batman too! There’s no doubt in my mind that they are keeping everything that works with the DC Universe and just redoing the things that didn’t. They’ll keep Wonder Woman, aquaman, Shazam and whoever else they think works still and then they will soft reboot Pattinson as Batman and whatever other characters they need to change. Affleck is out. He’s not coming back. So the DCEU is gonna need a Batman. They’re gonna make 3 with Pattinson and not have a Batman for their extended universe? They’ll find a way to get people to understand the change and nobody will care if the movies are written better and give the directors creative freedom. They are still fighting for a DCEU! Plus cavil is pretty much saying he’s not done yet. They are regrouping and bringing in people that know the content. Let’s get real here people. At the end of the day it’s about money for the studios and they’re not just going to let Justice League sit and collect dust.",3
True that.,1
"Oh god, are you really comparing Gadot - who had 4 Fast & Furious films under her belt as well as some other stuff - and Momoa - coming off of one of the biggest TV shows of all time and had been getting steady gigs for about 15 years - to a guy that in the last 7 years have done a total of 5 episodes across 4 different shows?  Ray Porter isn’t just small. He’s insignificant.",2
He really doesn't need to get bigger. Carmine doesn't really need to be physically imposing.,3
"Wait...you’re serious?! Lol, you need a moment where he saves a cat?",1
Are you high? Even I who have profound respect for Snyder’s vision know damn well after BvS that his JL would have flopped also. At least WB would have had the credit to stick with Zack and us fans who were there since MoS. Unfortunately people hate what they don’t understand.,3
Oddly specific but does make sense and sounds better,3
Remember Keanu Reeves so called Q&A at an art school in London that was later debunked?,1
Unfortunately that stuff can happen. People can’t handle the change or the stress. It’s not good but it’s out there.,1
Why isn't John doe on here? He's really good. His voice actor is amazing  (https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/The_Joker_(Telltale),1
Yes well i assume u either don’t understand that this is new information. Because there isnt just speculation behind it. Or i assume you looked at it. Stepped into this room. Screamed “clickbait” and left.,1
"I would want them to go a little younger Freeze for Pattinson's Batman, but it would have been awesome to see Affleck go up against Waltz as Freeze.",1
"If the Luchador getup isn’t reason enough for people, then there’s no convincing anyone haha 🤷‍♂️",1
"Regardless, I think WB needs to continue reviewing their DCEU plan. The spinoff thing isn't just some wild speculation though, prior to JL's failure they were planning to set up multiple types of spinoffs, like a Joker solo starring Jared Leto, and a Joker + Harley film.  I do think there's a place for spinoffs in the DCEU, but they would work better as limited TV series akin to Disney+ shows for Marvel. That's what WB needs to realize: not everything can work out on the big screen. Use DC Universe or HBOMax to make some DCEU series starring smaller characters, give them cameo/supporting roles in future films. Otherwise, keep the films to the big players. We need to establish a solid ground for DCEU with solo films for the JL members (and a truly successful JL film first) before thinking about all these wild spinoffs like The Trench.",1
For good reason. But at the same time go ahead and fuck off and dont feel some type of way when people want to try something fresh. Something of their own design.,3
Of course. That's half the reason these films get made.,3
">I provided evidence to back up my claim.  Your evidence is them referencing a quote Zack gave that countless other bloggers completely wrote off as just him talking or something else.  >You ignored it and attacked me personally.  I didn't attack you personally.  Don't know where you are getting that.  I don't know you personally in order to attack you personally.  I asked what is your purpose.  I asked why are you debating me.  What are you getting at because I sure as hell don't understand your stance on this.  I asked you:  >Is it that mark is just recycling old shit?  >Is it that he is wrong in some way?  I'm trying to continue a conversation I am now thoroughly confused on the purpose of.  >Would you like to stay on topic, or would you prefer to concede that you're being intentionally obtuse?  You are just running around being negative from what I can tell.  As I've said.  It doesn't matter if information is somewhere else.    What matters is, coming from a Forbes article there is first hand knowledge being discussed, that isn't just people speculating or questioning sources, but first hand knowledge of these events.  Of the state of the film.    Written out in an article.    Not just said briefly in a loud room with a drunk and exhausted Zack.    But a writer who worked closely with someone who worked on the film and is close with Zack, and was given this information from a first hand source and was SHOWN proof of completion.  This is my point.  These other articles aren't first hand.  They can't with certainty claim things are true.  But also our only point in why this is great is to help change the narrative.  If all parties begin to agree that this cut is basically finished all around, it adds that next bit of pressure.  It changes the information that people are sharing with their audiences.",1
"Remember when some random blogger on twitter tried to say Zack is sexist, and the Amazons clapped back haaaard. The news outlets never covered the response from the actual actresses. Not to mention Zack's costume designer Michael Wilkinson is gay so he wasn't trying to design these costumes for the 'male-gaze' like the blogger was saying. Here's what the actresses said in response to the Amazonian costume criticism: [https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbip\_CMno49/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbip_CMno49/?hl=en)",3
"Or, now this might shock you, the'yre just the same person and it's set in a different decade. I feel like you're only basing this of physical appearence of the actors IRL. Not the character in universe. It honestly doesn't matter since The Batman is in the 90s, not after or close to before JL.",1
"Aka literally what happened with Post-Crisis Supes. Bryne MoS series wrote him more conflicted (In fact a little more depressing than Snyder's MoS), and it was only after Death of Superman that they got Silver Age optimism back.  Plus, it could be worse. It could be Bronze Age mopey Supes. The closest thing to that in movies was the Singer incident of 2006.",2
Snyder is very good at visuals but it’s too bad he can’t tell a good story to save his life. Lindelof’s Watchmen HBO show makes Snyder’s film look like amateur hour.,0
"Crisis-like event that reboots the timeline, but some characters retain memory of the old world. This way, you aren't handwaving Zack's awesome trilogy out, but also are free to recast going forward.",2
If only Justice League was there...,1
"I understand that #RTSC has a very slim chance but this article never even mentions Dwayne Johnson and Black Adam, obviously a major production in the near future. Also flies in the face of the hints out of the Johnson/Cavill/Garcia camps. Seems less than authoritative and more of a rumor round up.",3
I don't think this is the guy you want as your Kevin Feige.,0
How do you know that this is the design Snyder wanted but WB forced to change it?,1
Someone tag James Gunn! He needs to make him a member of the Squad!,2
Kalel no,1
"I swear I don’t get these people. Despite so many of the actors and crew members saying otherwise, you still knuckleheads say “oh the cut doesn’t exist”. If it didn’t exist, why would these people lie about it? I get Momoa owes a lot to Zack, but he doesn’t strike me as the type of person to do this just solely to please someone’s ego.",3
"Agree to disagree, look how civil we are!",1
"And here comes the downvotes 🙄 seems like even on this sub the ""comicbookfans"" know just the Reeve version... They should really start reading some comics with Superman..",1
This......makes absolutely no sense....I don't understand what you're trying to convey.,2
"Or just use Stephanie Brown.  No one would fucking care if you made Stephanie Brown Asian, I guarantee it. And ""streetwise urchin"" would totally mesh with her backstory.",3
Meanwhile all the recent “negative” news about #RTSC is giving more and more focus and interest for the film. It’s basically free publicity for WB because EVERYONE wants to write an article about it because it generates clicks. Never seen anything like it to be honest.,2
"Half way through the movie (if it is 214 mins). This must be in the history lesson then, or maybe something else? Zack says ""face to face"" it might not be the history lesson...",2
"It's not necessarily that girl gang movies don't work. It's the story and tone of the movie.  'Go woke, go broke' is underlying point here. If BoP was about the characters, had a great story and not 'gIrL P0wEr!!!' It should have a reasonable chance of being successful.  I really think it can, so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. *fingers crossed*",2
"Explain. You're the one that made the claims, it's up to you to prove them right. As well, nothing I said was wrong. Lex was a mad scientist in the OG continuity and Birthright brought that back for early Lex.  I've seen most of the ""contrivances of BvS"". And most of the time the critics are confused about plot details that the theatrical cut missed, or they straight up get things wrong when it's right in front of them.",1
"Lol? How is it 'recklessly' killing or atleast intensively injuring a bunch of mercenaries shooting at him with mounted machine gun turrets?. Where's that issue, if you're going to keep trying to compare to other Batman's try and pick one that doesn't actually kill...oh wait. Yeah they mostly all do.

"To pin an action scene on I guess.   You're right that there isn't a specific character motivation (hell, if he were dressed as Batman, I could at least understand, he wants to ... somehow try to fight). The intensity at which he's driving toward .. something would make you think he's .. going to help evacuate his building I guess? It's strange. I guess they must've felt that they couldn't just have Bruce sitting at Wayne Manor in Gotham watching on the news, as they'd think he'd want to do something, but, they also don't really have a good sense of what he'd actually be doing.   A good idea for an opening and I like it for the most part, but, yeah, just a bit strange. Also, it's sort of unintentionally funny that his employees refuse to stop working until their CEO calls them specifically. *There's a giant alien space laser ffs, no one thinks to run for their lives?!*",1

Probably nothing.   Casual Audience who watched the theatrical version will be surprised by the changes in SC and definitely say it is better than TC.  CBM Fans who knew how disastrous TC was will be eager to see this and will understand how reshoots affected the final product.  DC Fans who complained about Superman being broody will finally see a better version the hopeful  superman.  Snyder Cut supporters will be enjoying the moment as they see all the above people recognizing wbat they've been fighting for 2 years.  The only con is regarding the bloggers and people who denied the existence of SC despite all the evidences for reshoots were readily available to them and now they gotta take back their own words.,2

"We don't need physical copies, I don't think WB would make their money back after mass producing them. The easiest way to profit from the cut would be to release it on HBO Max or sell it digitally without having to worry about the physical offsets of DVDs/BRs.",2
"It kinda depends. I mean yes, we are introduced to Batman in the movie, a lot of it also goes around how he reacts to the presence of Superman and the destruction Lex wrecks in Superman's name. By contrast Superman is more of an object that moves through the movie that everyone reacts to. It's only really near end Superman really starts to do things. But at the same time, Clark is sort of more in the movie, he is out doing things as himself and it's only near the end the two become one.",1

"Reshoots *are* an extra thing in Hollywood as far as the timing, funding and contracts - extra X per day *if* needed for reshoots - is concerned. *Especially if you tell your actor you don't need him.*   You definitely don't get to choose to do it when *you* want if he's working elsewhere. Otherwise actors and productions would be spending half their lives waiting for his/her previous production to finally officially finish which would mean Hollywood would grind to a halt.  Imagine if it was the reverse and MI needed him back, with a mustache, and now JL has to shut down for a minimum of a month to grow back the tache, plus however long the reshoots take. It would be madness.   Reshoots happen, but always fit around the actor's current production.   Edit: In some cases actors get recast if they aren't available for reshoots and their entire role reshot with someone else. Obviously if it's a main character then the movie gets delayed.",1

"I really don't understand posts like this. Whether you like him or not, Snyder was the chief visionary for the entire DCEU, and whether he's making any more films or not WB is still continuing on with his Wonder Woman and Aquaman. And most importantly, the film being discussed is an unreleased alternate version of a Justice League movie. The Justice League is the apex of all DC Comics, a team of DC's biggest heroes. Of course that's going to get way more attention than anything else, especially given the very public series of events which resulted in a completely mediocre studio cut of the film. And now the stars of the film itself are joining in the call for the original cut. What do you see as more important to discuss right now than this? As fans, we're all excited - or at least hoping for the best - when it comes to upcoming projects like The Batman, Black Adam, ect., but outside of the little bits of info that come out (which do get traction here), there's not much to talk about with them yet. Meanwhile Snyder and other crew members are dropping atomic bombs into this fandom on a weekly basis. I honestly cannot understand how a DC fan wouldn't be thrilled over the possibility of a basically all new and less compromised version of a Justice League movie.",2
"Less what “floats in my boat” and more what has actually happened, but okay.  Warner Brothers owns the footage and the legal ability to distribute it. As long as it’s unreleased I’ll blame them for not doing so, not the scoopy pants they’ll send as distractions.",2

People do things to get what they want.  >Anonymous sources  Those very sources kept saying Affleck was out for two years (which was the truth) but y'all kept being in denial. Something similar happening for snyder cut doesn't surprise me. You do you tho.  >Not hearing it from WB  They don't deem those to be significant enough to worth addressing I guess.  >Movie is complete  VFX team of that movie said work is needed on those but okay.  >No risk  But there is. If they caved in once, y'all would start spamming them with something else. Having him make the JL movies that were cancelled or releasing Ayer cut and so on. They'd know this works and double down on this shit. WB doesn't want to open that can of worms. No one in their right mind would. Furthermore it would clash with Ava's movie. They're looking forward, not backwards. They would also be criticized if it's better than the theatrical one.  They have no incentive to release it but people refuse to see it because they don't want it to be true.",1
How the fuck did Aquaman do that well lol I wonder if a significant factor towards the Jokers success is the repeat views/moviegoers,1
"I really didn’t like the incredibly fake-looking white hair. They should have just stuck with his natural black hair with grey streaks.

But there were also reports that they would often work out together and compete with one another, which makes sense - and of course would probably aid them to get into character and ""hate"" each other. lol   Especially since Ben is outspoken about hating exercising.",3
"Im on the train that thinks this movie will probably... Not be great. But so far I like what I see from Black Canary. I think people who are concerned about Cassandra Cain should be very worried.  I do hope I'm wrong, if this movies is awesome I'll be pleasantly surprised.",3
This suit is so perfect.,1
It’s difficult to want to support WB with their DC films when I know the studio robbed me with a fantastic JL film.,2
> He then rewrote it to be as trash as all of his other projects  His extremely popular and well received projects. I get that popular doesn't always indicate quality but it's not like he's only had a few hits in his career.   WB could have easily pushed the release without issue. Especially with a genuine reason like Snyder's situation.,2

"Agreed, and this is the crucial issue that whedon bashers seem to be missing. Not to forget that WB edited out whedon’s footage as well.  This is going to be an unpopular opinion,but the way I see it, it really seems like whedon tried to retain the major beats of the Snyder cut, albeit butchered big time by the suits. What we lost (admittedly good stuff) were character development scenes, connections to Darkseid and potentially evil superman as a brief plot point(which is again up in the air). I highly doubt the movie would have ended on a cliffhanger with the Injustice storyline like it was rumoured (that version is probably the ‘scary’ version of the film which Snyder stated they never shot).",1

"No, not really  JL was an ugly looking cheap CGI up the wazoo shitfest that had nothing going for it, no great reviews, it was short, it was following several movies that a lot of people either hated or weren’t overly impressed by.  Joker is a movie connected to the most famous comic book villain of all time starring a massively popular actor, and sold as a character drama/thriller inspired by Martin Scorsese’s movies.  Big difference.",1
Get Bryan Cranston and call it a day.,1
Looks fucking amazing,2
its not...,3
"Well see now my point makes sense? However, keep in mind, the overt profit sharing, wanting to make Joker a comedy and giving Todd Phillip's a small budget to ensure he doesnt make the film, trying to meddle with Aquaman while James Wan worked on it. Not really having a clear sense of where they want to go either these characters beyond just a bunch of standalones. Sounds more like WB on the verge of an Identity Crisis  And actually there is a step in my process that would mean the Snyder Cut is key. If WB took a moment to reflect on what they should do next, what did work in the past, what they did wrong but notice that clearly going with the current direction isn't as exciting as fans would hope, so maybe they need to step back and bring back some of the things that were working before. The Snyder Cut is part of that. Going back to a movie that they screwed up with with, after releasing the shitty Theatrical Cut, and going back to a formula that was unique or different and not the same old nostalgia stuff or woke stuff.",2

"I liked the whole TV 'psychologist' thing they did with her in **The Batman**. It did make her pairing with Joker seem a bit rushed and not as effective as 'Mad Love' but it worked well enough for the show.

"- If Finch would listen either way there's no motive to lie. - No, I said TWO governments AND Lex could TEMPORARILY hide a secret.  Lois still pierces Lex's conspiracy and the CIA cover-up, and happens to be out-of-Nairomi before the Nairomi government sweeps up. Kahina's circumstance is completely different from Wally's under this theory where his DAUGHTER is ALIVE.  Two years on she'd be a tween, her dad is making national news and claiming her mom- who she saw die- is still alive and walked out on them.  No.  Lex can't fix that.  He couldn't even fix his own evidence which is why he goes down for Capital Hill. - Lex has power, he's not omnipotent, psychic, or a time traveler.  He can't rope Wally into a conspiracy 2 years later and have it hold up.  For 2 years Wally has been operating under the reality that his wife is dead in the BZE (under this interpretation)... then he's just supposed to agree with Lex on his say so on national TV and in front of Congress?  ""Who the #$@! are you?"" ""I'm the smartest man in the room, I know you lost your wife in the BZE but I want you to lie to Congress for me."" ""What, why?"" ""Don't worry about it, because I said so.""  This doesn't satisfy Wally, much less the viewer to explain WHY Lex wants him to lie. - The checks, written as Wally, read:     1. BRUCE WAYNE OPEN YOUR EYES      2. B. WAYNE I AM YOUR GHOST      3. BRUCE NO TRUCE      4. B. WAYNE I HAUNT YOU      5. BRUCE WAYNE = BLIND  These make no sense if Wally loves Bruce and sees him as the hero that saved his daughter.  If they make no sense, then Bruce wouldn't believe Wally wrote them and he wouldn't fall for Lex's patsy plan.  It's precisely because the checks are plausible- that we can believe Wally would send them and be angry at Bruce- that Bruce too believes Wally did it... and DOESN'T suspect some larger conspiracy or mastermind behind Wally.",1

While I don't think the Man of Steel score comes anywhere close to that benchmark it's still a great score and is easily the best musical accompaniment to any film in the DCEU by a wide margin.   Much like Man of Steel itself, it's an underappreciated accompaniment to a movie that is way better than people give it credit for.",0

We've seen so many people claim about needing representation and needing representation Union representation that whenever you see these diversity quotas filled you can't help but all of a sudden be like all of this is part of that diversity representation that everyone keeps talking about kind of thing. Actually what you are saying about the whole need for diversity representation is still part of what I'm talking about. So if anything you're kind of enhancing my point. Like I said there is plenty forms of diversity in the shows and movies that we are exposed to today. Sorry it's not a hundred percent in the favor that you want or in ethnic group that you particularly want but you have to realize also there are demographics and percentages of people so it would make sense that certain groups are not in bald as much as others. Sorry that you don't understand that. We have plenty of diverse people and shows. You actually can't go two channels are two movies without looking at a fully Drapers cast nowadays. So I fail to see your argument I'm just saying that overly doing it and doing it to characters that there's really no needs to it or doing it just for the sake of it is quite frankly pointless. Because somehow making things diverse just makes things more relatable. News flash if something's relatable something's relatable. Doesn't matter if someone's black doesn't mean automatically more relatable. It doesn't matter if someone's gay doesn't mean they're more relatable. If anything saying that those people are more relatable is offensive to other people that may not be represented or have been represented but they're considered not relatable.,1

"That contradicts the movie prior? To you, you may not care but if they keep stepping over stuff like this over ""creative choices,"" it will start looking like a mess like the X-Men movies.

"Yeah the inclusion of Superman in the article's title is a bit clickbait-ish. It says that they've discussed different ideas for a movie, including a meeting with Michael B. Jordan for a version of the character, but that it isn't happening due to him having enough on his plate already with other projects. It also confirmed that there have indeed been talks with JJ Abrams, which of course isn't surprising, but it is good to hear from a big trade.",3
Thanks. Any news on whether the Snyder version will be released?,1
"It seems unlikely they used only 40 mins of Snyder’s footage. If memory serves me right, guild rules state that if a director is given credit, then 51% of his footage should be used (hence why they pretty much reshot solo to remove lord miller from the credits). At 120 mins of runtime, whedon would have gotten 60 mins in tops.",1

What were your thoughts when the MCU Hulk changed from a white man to an italian man?,2
"Granted, reposts are irritating. For instance, we already have two threads about Danny Elfman's thoughts on the Snyder Cut, even though it's technically old news since he was reported to have said that a few days ago. And most of the ""Will the Snyder cut be released"" threads are just as much a retread as the ""How I would have rewritten the DCEU"" posts, which I'd argue are even more tiresome.  However, most of everything else is reporting on articles and/or people with credibility (IE Snyder himself) posting new pictures or revealing more information about JL, which is technically ""News"" and related to the DCEU, which makes it just as relevant to post about as any new casting, screening, shooting, writing, etc. piece of info that comes from Flash, The Batman, Birds of Prey, WW84, The Suicide Squad, The Trench, Black Adam, etc.    So I really don't see the point in complaining as, like it or not, Snyder had a lot to do with the current DCEU which this sub is dedicated to discussing.",1

Look, I get that you want the cut to be released (and I’ll watch it if it is), but to say that his JL would be significantly better than what was released is not guaranteed. Given his track record...it might not even be true.    Heck, it’s more likely that JL would have been better received if Whedon actually had been there from the start. His track record is at least better than Snyder’s.    Either ignore that real criticism is warranted or get salty when it’s pointed out. Your choice bud.",0

I'm sure she will say yes.  But the girl from Queen and Slim looks great also",1
I don't know what any of this is supposed to be. I see a hyena on a couch and a bunch of post-it notes on a wall. I don't get it.,2
I simply don't like whedon in general. Obviously WB is at fault that's not disputed but I just can't help but imagine a finished justice league with Snyder's vision.Whedon as a director should've at least been somewhat original you can't sit there and tell me that he didn't at least have some creative control when he rewrote 80+ pages. Again WB is at fault. I simply absolutely hate whedons justice league and you can't change my hate for him bc I just don't like his work in general as a director and writer.,0

"DC Films appears to have hit its stride, rebounding from the commercial failure of “Justice League” and the critical drubbing of “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” with a few well-timed box office successes. “Aquaman” and “Joker” both generated over $1 billion at the global box office, becoming the first DC productions to reach those lofty figures since Christopher Nolan wrapped up his Batman trilogy with 2012’s “The Dark Knight Rises.” The studio also scored with last spring’s “Shazam!,” a cheeky spin on the spandex genre, and has high hopes for upcoming releases such as “Wonder Woman 1984” and “Birds of Prey.”  “They’re on the upswing,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “They had a rocky period, but they’re starting to find their footing.”  DC Films may have achieved more consistency when it comes to reviews and box office performance, but there are still hurdles to overcome. Namely, the company and its parent studio, Warner Bros., have yet to figure out what to do with iconic characters Superman and Batman. The studio is farther along when it comes to Bruce Wayne’s alter ego, having re-cast the role most recently played by Ben Affleck with the younger and edgier Robert Pattinson. The former “Twilight” heartthrob has moved beyond his tween idol days, appearing in indies for the Safdie brothers, David Cronenberg, and Robert Eggers. He will don the cape and cowl in “The Batman,” which will be directed by Matt Reeves (“Rise of the Planet of the Apes”) and will feature villains such as the Riddler (Paul Dano), Penguin (Colin Farrell), and Catwoman (Zoe Kravitz).  There had been chatter that the entire film would unfold in Arkham Asylum, the high-security prison known to comic book fans for housing super-criminals, but that is not the case, according to insiders. Only a handful of scenes will be set at Arkham. If the movie works, Warner Bros. and DC believe that any of these villains could headline their own spinoff movies. Key cast members in both “The Batman” and “Birds of Prey” have contract options to appear in sequels and standalone films.  The studio has less clarity on what to do with Superman, a character who has now been rebooted two different times in the last 13 years, once with Brandon Routh (“Superman Returns”) and later with Henry Cavill (“Man of Steel”) without landing on a winning strategy. Superman has also appeared frequently on television, in shows such as “Lois and Clark” and “Smallville,” which has led to some fears at Warners that the market could be over-saturated with hot takes on all things Clark Kent.  To help find a way to make Superman relevant to modern audiences, studio brass has been polling lots of high-profile talent. There have been discussions with J.J. Abrams, whose company Bad Robot recently signed a massive first-look deal with the studio, and there was a meeting with Michael B. Jordan earlier this year with the “Creed” star pitching Warners on a vision for the character. However, Jordan isn’t ready to commit to taking on the project since filming doesn’t seem likely to happen for several years and he has a full dance card of projects. Insiders think that a new Superman film is unlikely to hit screens before 2023, given that there’s no script and no director attached.  Internally, insiders are quick to credit Walter Hamada, the longtime New Line executive who was brought on board in 2018 as president of DC Films, with helping to plot a new, more sustainable course for the DC cinematic universe. He’s credited with having a strong sense of story and with keeping a firm eye on the bottom line, reining in budgets so productions don’t go off the rails. It also helps that he is closely allied with Warner Bros. film chief Toby Emmerich, with both men having worked together on past New Line hits such as “It” and “The Conjuring.” Insiders believe that under the former regime of top DC film executives Jon Berg and Geoff Johns and DC Entertainment head Diane Nelson, there were too many decision makers involved, leading to the lack of a clear vision. They also maintain that Warner Bros. erred by initially rushing movies in the hopes of making release dates that had been snapped up before scripts were even fully in place. Emmerich has made righting the DC ship a key priority since taking control of the studio in 2017.  “Their initial mistake was that they tried to do too much, too fast,” said Robbins. “They were trying to copy the Marvel model, but that took time and years of building up characters. You can’t start with a big ensemble movie. You need to earn that.”  Under Hamada and Emmerich, the studio has become more comfortable with backing comic book movies for adults. “Joker” became the first DC release to nab an R rating, but it won’t be the last. “Birds of Prey” is also expected to get a similar rating and insiders predict that James Gunn’s upcoming “Suicide Squad” sequel will also be R-rated. In the case of “Birds of Prey,” the film won’t be in the pitch-black, grim vein of “Joker.” Insiders describe the film has a more humorous, spirited, girl gang adventure, albeit not one for younger children. A series of recent reshoots dramatically improved test screening results and the studio is confident “Birds of Prey” will be a hit when it opens in February.  Analysts believe the studio has hit upon a smart strategy — 20th Century Fox had backed R-rated comic book movies such as “Deadpool” and “Logan,” but after being bought by Disney, which prefers its heroes to be cleaner and less prone to f-bombs, it’s unclear if it will continue to back those type of projects.  “There’s a huge appetite for R-rated superhero movies and if Marvel isn’t going to step up, that presents an opening for DC to tap into that audience,” said Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations.  Beyond embracing the darker undercurrents of the DC canon, the company is also revisiting characters that they believe were ill-served by previous big screen adventures. “Green Lantern Corps” remains a priority despite the fact that 2011’s “Green Lantern” was a high-profile commercial disaster. Johns is delivering a script at the end of the year. The project may be presented to Abrams and Bad Robot to see if the company would be interested in producing the picture. However, Greg Berlanti, another major talent on the Warner lot, is partnering with Johns on a “Green Lantern” television show. There’s speculation that relationship could lead to his involvement in a feature film.  Warners and DC also still have faith in Ezra Miller’s smart-ass interpretation of the Flash and are proceeding with development on a standalone film based on the character. DC has tapped “It” director Andy Muschietti to oversee the movie and has enlisted Christina Hodson (“Bumblebee”) to write the screenplay — Hodson will finish that assignment that before moving on to write a screenplay for “Batgirl.” Production on “The Flash” won’t be able to start until Miller finishes up work on the next “Fantastic Beasts” film, which means that cameras are unlikely to roll until 2021.  DC is also looking to capitalize on the box office success of “Aquaman.” It is currently looking for a director for “The Trench,” a spinoff about a group of vicious undersea creatures who played a supporting role in “Aquaman.” For the next film centered on Jason Momoa’s king of Atlantis, DC has once again tapped James Wan and is hoping to commence shooting in early 2021.  DC’s future won’t unfold entirely on the big screen. HBO Max, WarnerMedia’s upcoming streaming service, is currently looking for DC properties that could inspire films to premiere on its platform. It hopes to make DC adventures that have slightly lower budgets, requiring them to rely on up-and-coming actors and not established stars, with a goal of keeping production costs under $65 million.  The launch of HBO Max had inspired some hopes that Warner Bros. might allow Zack Snyder to release a director’s cut of “Justice League,” leading to a social media campaign dubbed #ReleaseTheSnyderCut. Snyder directed an earlier version of the ill-fated super-team movie and had planned to do some reshoots. However, after his daughter died, he was not able to complete production and was replaced by Joss Whedon, who injected a more light-hearted tone into the final film. Logistically, however, there’s little appetite at the studio for spending the millions of dollars it would require to finish visual effects and editing work on Snyder’s version, particularly as “Justice League” was a commercial disaster. There are currently no plans to release a Snyder version either in theaters or on HBO Max.  “That’s a pipe dream,” said one knowledgeable insider. “There’s no way it’s ever happening.”",0

"To be completely honest, Bruce at no point in the film views Clark as a person. He's an enemy, an alien, a threat - it doesn't even seem to cross his mind that he might live a normal life and I mean why would he? He's a god, he can lift buildings, and take a bullet straight to the face, why would this God, who Bruce believes to be a threat to the survival of the human race, why would he be a normal person with a normal life?  I think the key thing to keep in mind is Bruce takes any excuse he can the whole film to demonise Superman and justify his actions.  ""You were never a God, you were never even a man"" - This line is exactly what I'm talking about. He doesn't care who or what Superman is, he just wants to bring him down, whatever the cost.  He's angry, grief struck and suffering PTSD the whole film, nightmares over and over of his parents death or the hell Superman is about to bring, it's actually kind of believeable that Bruce, as broken as he was, wouldn't care *who* Superman is, he just wants to teach him that he's not a God and that he doesn't matter - finding out that Superman is just a regular dude in his day-to-day would probably break that tunnel-vision for him and break his disillusionment that he is a threat to humanity.  And then the first thing that happens during the ""Martha"" scene is Bruce's PTSD coming back, fucking with his head and causing him to break down and start questioning everything - only when Lois Lane comes in and clarifies that Superman was just there to save his mother he realises he was the villain.  Anyway, tl;dr he straight up didn't seem to care *who* Superman was, just that he needed to be stopped, and the film seems to back this up a lot",2

"Bottom line: consider the theatrical cut is 120 minutes in length.  35 minutes of that is apparently what Zack created and intended to be in the film.  His original cut of the finished movie was said to be around 215 minutes(!!!) in length.  We're talking nearly three entire hours of movie that got cut, edited, or thrown on the shelf.   Drives you crazy, doesn't it?",3

"The difference is that Star Wars is really popular in the west, it doesn't really play very well in asia. The Last Jedi also got a very mixed reception, especially among the fandom (not to disimiler to BvS). The Last Jedi's legs were awful for a Christmas release, in fact I think it has the worst legs for any major xmas release. Jumanji was the right film in the right place and the right time. The Greatest Showman also benefited massively.   Avatar on the otherhand was MASSIVE everywhere. Its also tricky to predict, was it a one hit wonder? I don't think it will be and I will never ever bet against Jim Cameron who delivered two of the greatest  sequels in the history of cinema.   Think about this little mind blowing stat, Endgame made over $100m in 4 countries, very impressive. Avatar did it in 9 countries and this was 10 years ago.  It also made $200m in China (4 times higher than any prior Hollywood movie) and was pulled from cinemas early because of its message and popularity. Btw when Avatar was released there was about 5,000 cinemas in China, today there are 60,000.  There is no way Avatar and Black Adam open together, WB will change that release date.",1

"False: WB previously released Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, very similar circumstances.   Except that the Snyder Cut will be a complete movie because Zack Snyder got to finish principal photography on Justice League before he was replaced by Joss Whedon, Richard Donner who directed Superman The Movie was fired by the Salkind producers while he was still shooting Superman II.   He got replaced by Richard Lester who they owed money from his work on the Three Musketeers if I remember correctly, Ray Fisher who played Victor Stone / Cyborg in JL also stated that Zack shot enough footage for almost two movies. There is a video of this where he says this on stage at a convention, it’s on YouTube.  I am 99.9% sure that Zack would never let a Workprint or Assembly Cut be released, if the HBO Max rumors are true then WB / Snyder should have enough time to put the final touches on the movie before HBO Max launches in May 2020. I really hope they also choose to distribute it on Blu-Ray / 4K UHD, really need that physical copy next to Man Of Steel and BvS: Ultimate Edition in my collection ❤️",3

The reason why Marvel movies are the only ones on the list that did a decent job with any of that source material (and I wouldn't include all of the ones listed as good) is because none of the Marvel movies tried to do it in one movie.

Why always him? He's overrated as fuck and play always the same bland character. He will never be at the same level as Mahershala Ali (less known but wonderful actor). Stop with the ""Mac Donald"" actors like Michael B Jordan, Tom Holland, Brie Larson, Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, etc...

Am I the only one fine with both ways. The whole thing with DC atm is that directors should get to do whatever they want and while honoring broad plot strokes is good the details and aesthetics don't need to be the same movie to movie.

Inspiring change in the most hardened heart and trying to remain steadfast in your ideology is as Superman as it gets.

"Even though it's in the Snyder Cut, I still don't like the idea of Diana telling Bruce everything about the enemy, like it's just a convenient way to make the characters and audience aware of the plot.  I assume that's one of the changes the studio made while Zack was still on board.  They forced mandates and ""fixes"" on the movie that Zack was still scheduled to shoot, and to doctored Terrio's original script too.  An absolute shame!",1
You know who can’t stand a person having his own opinions?  You.,0
And talking underwater is an ability shared by Atlanteans. Case closed.   Stop twisting yourself into a pretzel defending this bad idea he had. You're allowed to like him and still recognize a bad idea as one.,2
"I'm not familiar with WGA rules, but I've been wondering for 2 years how WB managed to get away with changing the film that much and still stamping Snyder's name on it for him to take the blame. It's bizarre.  Maybe if he'd insisted on his name being removed, he'd have forefeited his right to a director cut? That's all I can imagine.",1
"I agree, but it would have taken considerably LESS cgi if they just went with [this design](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dcmovies/images/e/e9/Steppenwolf_JLG%26M.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/280?cb=20151007145750).   Sure, it's not super scary or intimidating, but Hinds would have definitely made it up by adding gravitas to the character, since he could be more expressive with his face.",1
"Lol, I don't give a fuck. I'm glad it made 1 billion. JL before it was sabotaged by WB was already going to make 1.1 billion. For future movies, if we don't get the Snyder Cut, I'm boycotting the fuck out of them.",1
"Williams is older, but he still can write amazing scores, while Elfman didn't do anything great in a long time.",1
You’re fun,1
This was shot by Snyder.  You can see a fraction of how this looked like from the first trailer. ( close up shots for every hero ),3
>Movies that alot of people don't really care for. Except for a few.  I.E. The Snyder Cut of Justice League outside the hardcore fan bubble....,3
"Oh God, then does that mean Justice League 2 would have theoretically started with the League facing Darkseid in the Boom Tube portal since that's how Justice League was supposed to end? Damn just thinking about it makes me nut.",1
BvS is by far the best. It had possibly the best fights out of all superhero movies.,1
Hasta la vista Baby,1
Only if it's actually canon to the current DC film universe so that we can get a super fleshed out Scarecrow to take on an establish Batman.  Instead of a side pocket universe that can't ever cross over with either the 'DCEU' or the Reeves Batman (which may be its on stand alone series).,1
You dropped this /s I think.,3
Sucks for you then I guess. :p,3
"Nobody is forced to sort by posts via. the filter, so all it means is those who have no interest in discussing the “Snyder Cut” won’t have to see posts about it.",2

Thanks dude =),1
Love the idea.,1
"Those set of comments is what alot of fans dont understand. They want heroes to stay the same.  As soon as they're placed in our bleak world,  everyone loses their mind.  It's another version/ take on the superhero. And you can still find the core themes/ideology they represent.   ""I'm like.. wake the f*ck up!""",3
"> Cavill is immensely proud of MOS - he's said so numerous times both before and after the movie came out. ""I don't think I'd change anything"" about sums it up.   Don't you think there's a gap between ""immensely proud"" and ""I don't think I'd change anything""?",3
"I loved this outfit, it was perfect for that costume.",2
"I feel like Diana needs an upgrade.   Only Zack is the only one cool enough to give her a badass upgrade that goes against the grain of how other people would imagine her; Marvel-like and too conservative with their idea of her; that she’s gentle and political with grace, and not the rough hard ass side of her.",2
posted this on another comment but [this](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/05/20/johnny-depp-v-amber-heard-depp-submits-photos-black-eye-scratches/3450310002/) is a summary of what’s been going on between her and Johnny Depp.  TL;DR She accused Johnny Depp of domestic abuse during the #metoo movement and his reputation took a hit in a lot of people’s eyes and lost him roles. He comes out with substantial evidence that she was actually the one abusing him and people close to both of them have corroborated his story. There’s another article that details the people who corroborated his story but I’m in class rn and will post later if I get a chance.,1
"I prefer Selina's father to be the lion but Matt Reeves is really into Dark Victory and When In Rome ties into that heavy. It always bothers me, especially since the whole trilogy is about the falcone siblings. The Lion definitive storyline  for her felt better. Especially taking over her father's lost family.",1
god no,2
Fuck yeah! That’s inspired casting,3
Or they’re just using new scenes for a new HBO Max trailer.,2
I prefer the long hair Selina. Still excited to see her take though.,1
"https://collider.com/joker-2-sequel/   From August 22nd..   > “One thing I will tell you: I would do anything with Joaquin, any day of the week,. There’s nobody like him. If he was willing to do it, and if people show up to this movie, and Warners came to us and said, ‘You know what? If you guys could think of something…’ Well, I have a feeling that he and I could think of something pretty cool.”",3
They're not going to jump from a prestige actor like Joaquin Phoenix to Skarsgard or Wallstorm. Whoever the next Joker is will probably be an Academy Award Nominee or Winner.,0
I clearly mentioned Snyder Cut 😁  Just Kidding. I made it darker only because of my phone display.:),1
I'd never say that to such a well written and thought out response 👍🏻. I agree with everything you said.,1

Maybe we will.🤞🤞,2

"Ah crap 😣 Well, you bummed me out!",1
"I’ve always said that the main difference between Affleck’s status and Cavill’s status was that one actually wants to keep doing it. The other was ready to move on.  Sounds like Affleck was ready to go for a very long time. He may not have been totally happy with the Superman movies he got, but We’ve never heard a lick about Cavill being ‘unsatisfied’ with being Superman, and that’s the main reason why I didn’t want to say that he was probably gonna leave as well.   Does this mean he’s staying? No. But it confirms that he’s still interested in doing it, and that’s already a better starting point then what we had with Affleck. It would be different if Cavill stayed mum on this subject.",3

Depends on what source material they'll be using,1
"It's not about sexy, it's about quality.",1
"Yeah, if he wants to be onscreen with Superman and doesn't give a shit about Shazam, why not be Lobo or something? Or one of many other big imposing DC antiheroes that I'm sure people could mention?",1
My issue is more with your logic. Like someone doing something bad isn't an excuse for other people to do it.,1
So you don't think Snyder could have sold an alternative?,0
Alleged abuse.,0
"Not really interested in other villains. I mean villain movies are neat, but I want DC Black to do The Question. There are so many possibilities for non traditional comic book movies.",1
They decided to make their friendship completely platonic on the new animated series for some reason.,1
Also their choice on color led to a nice contrast of rich vs poor when Arthur and Bruce meet for the first time. They are both wearing the same exact color outfits only Bruce’s looks more expensive and Arthur’s more raggedy.,3
 Quite different example…  Sonic redesign is to prevent it from flopped due to huge negative feedback. JL Snyder Cut is about pour more money to finish VFX in order to re-edited one of the biggest disappointment box office 2 years ago which cost WB a lot.  Donner cut is not a great example either because Superman 2 was not a flopped or bad film to begin with.  The good example that you guys are looking for is Kingdom of Heaven where director cut is far better than theatrical released but I doubt Snyder is as good director as Ridley Scott.,2
Listen the end product sucked but WB owns everything Snyder filmed and that’s the way studios do business. Many films throughout history have always had large interference by the studio. It sucks but it’s not new.,1
"Ooh, I like that fancast!",1
You’re right. Sexualizing isn’t always bad but if Mera ever willingly goes into battle in her cleavage costume I will kill someone.,0
"Dude talked about TDKR like hes read it, but he thinks Batman kills in it so he clearly hasnt. Ive no idea why this sub rides the dude so hard. Im interested in seeing his version of JL too but the dude doesnt get the characters.  Also this painting is foreshadowing the good guys fighting bad guys that come from space. It aint that deep.",0
"I mean, if the hashtag got over 700k tweets, guess how many #CancelHBOmax could get if it isn’t a launch title....  The fans have campaigned hard and peacefully. Imagine the feel of betrayal if they don’t release it. Fans have an opportunity to hit them in the wallet and trend that hashtag on launch day.  Do they want to risk that hashtag trending when streaming wars are at an all time high? If they release it they not only reduce risk but will he on the positive trending side which pays for any additional effort the Snyder Cut needs.",2
"Wow, he has like an actual design and isn't just an uglified Loki. This is actually pretty cool.",2
"Aye, the Joker / Harley & Deadshot cues are all great. I'm quite intrigued to hear who Gunn picks up for The Suicide Squad. I'm betting Tyler Bates, which I'm all for: both Guardians of the Galaxy films had excellent scores.",3

"Wow, what a contradicting statement considering none of the three are trash",2
">the new fans couldn't get Shazam to a 400million but the Snyder fans got AQ to 1 billion,  Wut ? That's straight up dumb",1
Making up statistics like that isn't a proof you think it is,1
"Firstly M can you not swear? Not trying to be a prude but it makes you sound petulant.  Secondly no one's asking him to be magically fixed in the Martha scene. I myself would have just liked to see some more consistency with his whole epiphany in the previous scene. As in not starting by having him divebomb some randos.  Secondly we're not talking about other cinematic variants here, we're talking about Batfleck and his arc in relation to the film. Bringing other cinematic Batmen into the debate is a whack argument and I'm frankly tired of people using it  But since you wanted to bring other Batmen into this let's do that.  I would point out that the Burton Batman was pretty damn far removed from anything Batman (Guy himself has said he refuses to read a comic ever). Then you have the Nolan films which yeah he does kill in but there's two caveats to this. Firstly the League guys were before his becoming Batman and Harvey's death was clearly accidental (You have to be blind to ignore this). Other then that Nolan's didn't kill to my knowledge.  Also by killing in the comics if you mean the 30/s Batman or the assorted elseworlds you are objectively wrong. Virtually nothing of the Batman in the 30's got maintained (Many appearences were retconned to be Earth 2 I believe) and the elseworlds aren't even fucking worth mentioning. There's one where Superman is adopted by the Waynes, should that be his origin in Man of Steel?  Also pretty much every Batman incarnation at some point touches on the nature of vigilantism and it's positive and negative implications. It's not a new thing Snyder pioneered here, it is a basic concept in the genre. Snyder did have a good take on an older, bitter Batman but that's not my issue.  My issue is not even how Batman kills, it's that the ""Save Martha"" scene is robbed of it's poignancy by the next scene because Snyder didn't even attempt to show Bruce at least attempting to keep this in mind. Especially when his last scene in the film is him explaining his epiphany to Diana   That is my fundamental  problem with Bruce Wayne's voyage in this film",1
It feels a little weird without the capes!,3
"lol I fully agree with you, but it's still so absolutely bonkers to me that a fuckin mustache won out   Like, in terms of which is easier to replicate, it's GCI costing ~$500,000 & 100s of manhours vs a fake mustache.",1
"His comments are encouraging but it’s also worded a bit weird.  So someone help me out here: is he saying that they’re in the unofficially titled DCEU, or is he saying that they’re planning a sort of Shazam universe? Because the way he answered this question makes it seem like he’s talking specifically about the Shazam/Black Adam side of things.",2
"I think I looked at the image from a weird angle in the beginning, looks like Deathstroke is giving the finger to the camera!",1
I see it this way:  WB loses confidence on Snyder due to BvS.  They use a tragic moment in his life to fire him on the most cruel way posible proving they are pieces of shit.  They are aware that JL builds up a lot for future movies they now don't want to make.  They hire Whedon to make JL have less build up for the future since they don't want to continue this arc.  They let him such a low time because if they delay the movie AT&T buys Warner before the movie is released and the executives lose money.  And that's in my mind how that JL came to be.,1
"Well, Bane does wear a mask 9.5/10 of the time. They could hire this big ass bro and have Javier Bardem or Benicio Del Toro voice him.  Hell, probably Hector Elizondo since I love his voicework on Bane from Mystery of the Batwoman. Maybe Danny Trejo who did a good job on Young Justice.",1
i don't think this will be a bad film but it looks like a  really bad comic book movie in terms of adapting the source material. Caine seems to bare zero resemblance to her other than being asian. Huntress doesn't have a proper costume.  There are also rumors that EVERYONE in the film kills including Black Canary. Idk man.,2
Christopher Waltz as Catwoman.,3
"Isis as in the DC comics character, not the terrorist organization. I'm pretty sure she was linked to SHAZAM! (not the movie) back in the day.",2
"Damn it, Fallout has had more success battling the JL than Lex Luthor.",3
Excites for the film? Sure...maaaaybe. excited for what this film means for the greater implications of the DCU/first theatrical adaptations of the BoP/Cass? Not so much.  What are you excited or interested for? Are you a comic fan at all familiar with the Birds of Prey?,1
MOS is perfection. I always wanted the rumored prequel that was based on Krypton.,3
"Personally, I prefer it when a filmmaker makes one movie at a time. The more you dilute your attention the worse each of the products come out",1
I agree. A lot of people only focus on the mustache thing but other than that Superman in JL was classic Superman. He was my favorite thing in the movie. I can understand if people complain about the transition from BvS to JL being too drastic. But I don’t mind it.,2
Still curious if The Rock will have an accent for Black Adam,1
"Idk man The arkham Joker makes them seem like normal people,best version by far",2
"Both of whom are biracial. Lisa Bonet has a Jewish mother and a black father, while Lenny Kravitz has a black mother and a Jewish father.",3
Because the film probably needs an investment to finish special effects and they probably have already taken a big enough financial loss on the film and the embarrassment that ensued that they don’t wanna deal with it anymore.,3
You’re high. Not even twenty minutes are shots by Snyder.,3
They have money. They’re just  a bunch of dumb greedy bastards is all. Hopefully they listen and release it. Everyone wants it,0
">There are currently no shots of Ewan McGregor online helming the black mask which leaves a few concerns for me, i think it would be a massive missed opportunity if they only show the character before his accident for the duration of the film.  Hopefully its like Harvey Dent's transformation in TDK",1
"It's so weird. Everyone talks about how they want the campy Superman from the comics and old movies, and I sort of scratch my head. I think people's nostalgia makes all that seem more childish and campy than it actually was, because the Donner movie is NOT campy. The ""truth, justice"" line is literally taken as a mocking joke (It was post-Vietnam after all). The first actual scene of the movie is everyone on a dull empty planet dying. Hell, 90% of the MCU has way more jokes than Donner's Superman, which is actually pretty restrained and serious. Especially compared to the George Reeves show. Granted, that's just Supes 1, but I don't think anyone wants something like III, IV, or the Lester cut of II (Or they didn't until the Lester Cut got weirdly popular a few years back. Which I still do not understand).  As for the comics, Golden Age Supes killed a bunch of his enemies and wasn't afraid to get violent. Post-Crisis Supes was conflicted and didn't even want to save people until he was forced to and only became more hopeful after resurrection. Bronze Age Supes is just completely depressing. New 52 Supes... sucks. Meaning the only ""campy"" Supes is Silver Age Supes. Aka the shortest era of the character. And the one that was only that way because of the CCA neutering everything.  The only explanation: they don't care about the comics, they let their childhood view of the old movies shape their current view of them, and they base their interpretation of Superman basically entirely on the DCAU version. Aka the version literally written for kids. And unlike DCAU Batman, Supes was more censored by that fact (I guess because they wanted him to be more of a role model).  &#x200B;  But the guy above was also being sarcastic so this doesn't really matter.",2
"Why make MoS2? I enjoyed the movie but Superman seriously needs a soft reboot, not a continuation of the bastard that is the DCEU.",0
"The site is honestly a god send for leaked scores and keeping up to date with RCP releases. As far as credits and such go, it's absolutely pertinent for me. I'm interested in hearing if Hybrid will glean anymore information about Justice League. The Suicide Squad tidbit caught me by surprise, would have absolutely never guessed Junkie wrote a score for it.   On the topic of credits, did you know that Elfman actually had Geoff Zanelli (Pirates of the Caribbean & regular RCP additional) as well as Pinar Toprak (Captain Marvel) doing additional music on Justice League? I was similarly shocked to hear both of them had a tiny bit to do with the League.",2
"True but batman is a really really big role and a popular icon in culture, the biggest shes done is Charlie's Angel's and that's not even that relevant anymore",2
"TFA is well made, successful, well liked...but also safe. Safe to the point that it doesn't push the universe in any direction. He could probably make a successful comic movies, but the idea isn't exciting without a great writer on board to do something interesting",1

"We'll have to agree to disagree on that. I find a lot of his movies have a pretty consistent set of problems, though I did more or less like Man of Steel.",1

You wouldn't.,1
"I’d say the ultimate edition balances it,and the person who decided to cut out important story points should be fired",3

"Fatfleck is bigger than Cavill's Superman, and he's supposed to look tiny next to Bane",0
"It’s exactly the same thing. When they talk about D E P T H, it usually means that the film is shite.",1
This would be super good!! I feel like he can add the darkness of Mr. Freeze well while making it his own. Would love to see this!,1
Now THAT is a villain.,2
Didn’t know I needed it until I saw it. He’s perfect!,2
I really hope this sequel never gets made!,2
Trash I’m not excited for this film at all.,2
LOL I bet he was on set for like three days with Whedon given the quality but look how much of the film was changed. Insane.,3
Loved him in this,2
Because if Ben wasn’t satisfied with his script and he was struggling with his person life then why should they have let him continue?,2
This. Only if it's Rooney Mara as Harleen Quinzel.,2
That would be hilarious to see though,3
"WB offered to pay for and do the CGI to put it back on for Fallout, which would not have been hard at all, but Paramount refused. The reshoots happened because of Snyder leaving the project. Light reshoots would have happened anyways, as movies always reshoot scenes after all filming is done.",1
"I'm curious where you're getting your ""factual evidence"" from then.",2
"Micheal Wilkinson is the greatest costume designer. I hope he gets nominated and wins for Disney's Aladdin, because he hasn't won for any film yet (he was nominated for American Hustle).   The HBO show's costume designer is Meghan Kasperlik -- she was assistant costume designer to Michael Wilkinson on a few projects (American Hustle, Joy, Noah), who she described as a prime ""mentor and an amazing teacher"".",3
"The only con would be if hypothetically speaking the film turned out to be ""the unwatchable mess"" Wb said it was, on wich case wb would now have to really bad JL movies instead of just one.  But I highly doubt that the snyder cut is bad",1
Sounds like it's WB's fault for choosing Whedon then.,2
It wasn’t until Aquaman that I started thinking the DCEU would be okay.,2
Jesus fuck that suit is beautiful,3
STILL my Superman,2
Wait wtf he was talking to Mera and Vulko?,3
"None of that negates the fact that WB has no reason or interest in dishing out more money for a Cavill led Superman film when the past 3 didn’t work. General audiences don’t have the same connection with Cavill as Superman as they did with other comic book characters like Christopher Reeve, Hugh Jackman, RDJ, etc etc. You and your friends liked them, that’s great, but they aren’t winners across the board. BvS RT audience score is 63%.... thats 4% away from Rotten...   Split’s budget was $9 million dollars. That’s why they gave M. Night the green light. Not the $200+ a Superman film needs. It’s doesn’t make sense financially.",1
"I don't see why people are upset by this. Snyder also revealed that he had Dick Grayson in mind when asked about who the dead Robin was and also thought the Wayne Manor was long abandoned before Bruce even became Batman - these are headcanon ideas that Snyder was willing to allow other filmmakers to change it they so chose (Ayer changed the dead Robin to Jason and we already know Wan allowed the Atlanteans to talk underwater).  I personally dislike Snyder's ideas here, but they're easily dismissive in the long run. However, I do get personal pet peeves. I get really annoyed whenever someone talks in space without a helmet or comlink. It's just a pet peeve.",2
Hmmm I'm a little mixed on that one,0
Crossing my fingers for the WB origin story next.,2
He is talking about visuals and shots. Snyder knows how to tell a story with visuals.,1
Why am I being downvoted?!,1
He was saving face people. Everyone was hyping theatrical JL when it came out.,2
Henry Cavill got screwed over the most with the theatrical cut of Justice League. He should be the biggest promoter and supporter of #ReleaseTheSnyderCut so WB can redeem that movie.,0
I can't help but see my gear shifter when I look at that cowl,1
Frankenstein is not a shitty human being,0
"I think the original Parademon transformation was really scary.  There are concept arts which showcased scarier Steppenwolf, Hell-ish Apocalyptic designs, Parademon cocoons hanging from ceiling which Batman investigates.   It all changed as soon as BvS released.  Snyder himself said that they were kind of insecure at that time and changed alot of stuff.   Initial BvS reception had great impact on JL.  The studio should have waited for the Ultimate Edition to be released before making changes.  UE was well received by fans and made a lot of sense story-wise.",2
😻😻😻 trailer 2 incoming.,3
Wan did say his requirement for Aquaman 2 was he wanted a better script.  Terrio? Please?,3
"Well, that explains a lot!!!",1
It's a great superman story smothered by a pretty one note batman movie. (Even the UE is unbalanced),1
Wrote this is an earlier reply but relates to this  Despite however we all may view Amazons and whether or not Gal was will be subjective but I just like to point out how Gal has served in the armed forced for two years as a combat instructor and interestingly enough she also studied law and international relations. Gal may not be the WW that Darywn Cooke had at towering Superman but she is very much fit and active but most importantly she has this aura and charm about her. Regardless of Amazon heritage Gal's Diana is a demigod so that helps explain any further suspension of disbelief needed to believe Gal can be as powerful as Wonder Woman.,3
Look at what they did to my Cassie Cane,1
It's not like they have the same level of validity.  Variety > Deadline > THR  Why this sub thinks otherwise is baffling.,2

Well, keep asking for it and they'll continue not doing anything on it.",1
At first glance I thought he was giving me the finger,1
"Reeves wouldn't have to adhere to that if it's not needed. In the comics, Mera and Nereus were actually a couple instead of father and daughter like in 'Aquaman'.",1
"People usually aren't going to bother with smaller charcaters unless they're backed by a mega brand like the MCU, and bigger names are bigger draws.   That said, there are already examples of Black Supermen already, Calvin Ellis, Val-Zod, Tangent superman and Sunshine Superman  This isn't some conspiracy, and it's certainly not racist, if Jordan was meeting with WB about Superman, it was more than likely about Calvin Ellis or Val-Zod",2
"good for you analyze that. But i honestly don find it worth it to look into that given that I personally think this is very nitpicky and also this criticisms is very minor. So i'm not spending too much time looking too deeply into it. Plus i don agree with most of your statement  ""If we actually saw superman having to make a meaningful choice then people might not have found the death so hollow""  Actually we do see superman making a choice after he watch wonder woman being incapacitated, batman is nowhere to be seen and doomsday keep building up the energy. And superman decides to risk his life despite lois plea to him not to  ""There's no sense of him seeing any of that.""  Really?? I thought your problem is superman didn see wonder woman is down or situations become worse that prompt him to decides to risk his own life. Now you want to change it to superman didn need to see that?  ""We've seen her smashed across the battlefield and laugh it off like it's nothing and then chop off Doomsdays arm without the use of kryptonite.""  Im pretty sure there is a big difference between being punch by doomsday and being blast by the super laser beam and i'm pretty sure that laser beam did far more devastating damage than doomsday physical attack. Plus in the movie, you can clearly see that wonder woman have to use the bracelet and shield to block the majority of doomsday laser blast rather than taking it head on and shrugged it off like superman did. You don seriously really think that wonder woman is as durable as superman. Plus unlike superman, wonder woman did better because she is clearly shown to be a better fighter rather than just being a brute and keep on tanking a hit like superman  ""Are you going to argue that Superman saw something we didn't see, (wonder actually struggling), but didn't see something we saw, (Wonder Woman being able to inflict heavy damage)?""""  So?? The movie clearly shown that superman saw wonder woman being incapacitated and even if doomsday hand being chopped off, doomsday keep on building up energy and may gonna trigger again another explosion and does not seem to be stopping.",1

Let's not forget the drastic change of Edward Norton to Mark Ruffalo with the Hulk. And yet Marvel just kept pushing forward with the MCU.,3

">I only told you to fuck off because the fact that you were starting the aggression by being condescending and belittling anything I said and any opinion I gave.  But still, telling me to fuck off is pretty childish. Or we can be grown adults and not get mad when someone calls is a word we don't like.   >I was only pointing out my age because the fact that you were treating me as if I was a child who needed to learn things on and subject matter that you probably are only beginning to understand.   You clearly do need to be educated on the matter as you believe the opposite of what the evidence says. That's why I say your opinion is wrong, because it ignores reality by ignoring evidence.   If you actually did the research you would know that positive representation does help as simply googling ""the effects of representation"" comes up with dozens of studies that you can read.   >I wanted to actually educate you just like how you were trying to educate me on something that you didn't understand.   What about it do I not understand? If you are truly trying to educate me, please explain where I am wrong on this, please explain to me how positive representation is actually harmful?  >Oh I'm not storming off by the way understanding the debate and declaring that I won because you lost all relevance by referring to me as a boomer and by going and declaring that my opinion is wrong.   You disregarded my points and claimed you had won because I called you a word you didn't like.   How is calling your opinion wrong, wrong? Opinions are informed by evidence, and if your opinion is not backed by evidence, it's wrong.   Is the opinion that the earth is flat, wrong? Please tell me.    >so say my opinion is wrong automatically makes you the loser in this debate because you cannot accept my opinion was different than yours.  I can accept opinions that are different to me, as long as they are backed up by evidence, again, I'm not going to accept someone's opinion that vaccines cause autism because it is demonstrably true that they don't. Just like it's demonstrable that positive representation is a good thing.   Can you please show me why it's not a good thing?  >Actually I'm not a closeted bigoted.  Says the person who uses bigoted talking points like ""forced diversity""  >If anything you sound like a closeted bigoted to anyone that doesn't share the exact same opinion as you.  That's not being bigoted, I am open minded, I'm not intolerant of you simply because you hold a different belief to my own, but that doesn't mean I have to accept or respect your opinion as it's not based on evidence.   >That makes you sound like an absolute of fascist   Thanks for calling me a fascist, you clearly don't understand what that word means.   >because I can actually understand the fact that other people have different opinions than my own  I know people have different opinions than my own. Some are wrong because they're not backed by evidence. And some are purely subjective, like the quality of art.   >Unless you want to say that I'm wrong and continue to show your narrow-minded view on what all right opinion is versus the wrong opinion  You are wrong because your opinion doesn't hold up to scrutiny, you don't have any evidence for your opinions outside of lofty emotional reasons.   >Which by the way is a very narrow-minded bigoted mindset.  It's not, being open minded means that you are willing to change your beliefs and opinions when given good reason to do so.",0
He wants a producer's credit from what I've heard  A guy talked to him and Cavill mentioned wanting to have a more hopeful film with Brainiac,1
lmao no  take your company war bullshit the fuck out,1
"I don't cosider this as fanfic. Well, at least what I'm doing and I'm going to show you soon.",1
"Aquaman and Shazam just have that Marvel quality and tone to them. I admit, not a big fan of Snyder's vision, but I really give DC/WB credit for taking DC and giving it a unique tone separate from Marvel. I know some characters need to have darker and more serious tones than others, but I dunno. I wonder if those 2 films did really well because the GA just enjoys a good action movie with a funny and witty protagonist, which is what I feel like almost every leading character in an MCU is.",0
What he’s saying is negative energy is wasted energy.,3
Looks like Grace Randolph was right. Her sources are getting more reliable,3
I got a copy in NZ as well,1
Check out the original post on Vero for higher resolution.,3
"You’re placing the bar pretty high, don’t you think?",2
This is actually perfect.,2
It crazy to me that there's over two hours of Snyder footage we haven't seen yet.,3
"My view on Whedon has dramatically softened. If it wasn’t him, it would have been someone else. Maybe he thought he could retain enough of Zack’s vision while incorporating the new elements WB wanted.",2
So guys this isnt fan work. This is the image shared by the stunt team in their video yesterday.   John arryn i think made this fit.,3
That's like literally how sourcing works in journalism though. I get what you mean but are we really going to complain about proper journalistic practices?,2
I agree with you dude. I know the UE took out a lot of content that would clear things up but honestly the theatrical cut doesn't do too bad either. People are exaggerating.,1

"The [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/movies/snyder-cut-gadot-affleck.html) reveals this background info for the first time, as far as we know:  >After screening Snyder’s rough cut of “Justice League” for a small group of filmmakers including the “Straight Outta Compton” screenwriter **Andrea Berloff**, the “Wonder Woman” scribe **Allan Heinberg** and “The Avengers” director **Joss Whedon**, Warner Bros. hired Whedon to helm a substantial round of reshoots that included ***almost 80 new script pages***. This version gave Gadot and “Man of Steel” holdovers Amy Adams and Diane Lane far more to do, significantly trimmed subplots involving the Flash and Cyborg (one character, a love interest for Miller played by Kiersey Clemons, was cut entirely) and added more jokes.  It's apparent that the post-production writer's meeting included Geoff Johns, Jon Berg, Toby Emmerich, Joss Whedon, Andrea Berloff, Allan Heinberg, and [this video](https://youtu.be/m4b_4GLPQvs) also names Seth Grahame-Smith (who was briefly signed on to direct The Flash solo movie but [left the project](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/flash-movie-loses-director-888994) due to ""creative differences""). For the first time, we know that Joss Whedon wrote almost 80 pages of rewrites (in scripts, 1 page = 1 minute), which means, out of the 1 hour 59 minute runtime of Justice League, probably only about 40 minutes of Zack's version (33% of the theatrical cut) made it through untouched to the theatrical cut (which means audiences only saw 20% of the 214 min Snyder cut so far).  [Patty Jenkins liked a tweet of an article announcing Joss's departure from Batgirl](https://twitter.com/BatmanNewsCom/status/967477981554847746), and she didn't bring back Allan Heinberg as a writer for Wonder Woman 1984, possibly because of his involvement with Joss, so that was smart of Patty. I believe she is still loyal to Zack, as is James Wan, who showed Zack [an early preview of Aquaman](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/ac418a/article_aquaman_got_thumbs_up_from_zack_snyder/) despite the studio's objections. Zack Snyder is [still a producer on Wonder Woman 1984](https://batman-news.com/2018/06/13/wonder-woman-1984-press-release-reveals-zack-snyder-gal-gadot-as-producers-and-more/), and obviously Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, and Ray Fisher are loyal to Zack in standing with him.  Diane Nelson, former president of DC Entertainment, said ""\[Geoff Johns\] [is no buddy of mine.](https://i.imgur.com/D9A7WNl.png)"" and she tweeted out ""[\#ReleaseTheSnyderCut](https://twitter.com/dewnelson1/status/1196227881019432960)"".  Warner Bros following Zack again on twitter is a nice development.",3
"Maybe Justice League. Not BVS. But I could be wrong. Reboot is too soon man. Also, unnecessary.",0
"Isn't that the same as saying ""I shot a gun and the bullet happened to hit that guy""?",0
"Depends what you mean by bad, because this is subjective, not a mass murder spree. The fact that something is being criticised and feelings towards that thing are based negatively around a certain trait, yet is done by another, of which one would celebrate or have no problem with otherwise is less logical imo.",0
Would that i-twere so simple.,1
Thanks for the reply. I really don't mind when people say this movie wasn't that good or wasn't a fan of it. Its the ones that say it's the worst movie they ever seen.,1
"""The reshoots were minimal."" -Ray Fisher   ""We were fortunate that when Zack was not able to continue we got a guy who is very accomplished in his own right. [Whedon] he sprinkled some of his fairy dust on our movie and finished it. I dont think theres any way to go back and say 'oh that's a Joss scene, that's a Zack scene'. They were working together toward a common goal."" -Ben Affleck   It's all bullshit PR.",3
What does NDA means ?,2
I don't think he has social media. Maybe he'll get asked on the TROS press tour?,1
This is absolutely true and I can see that being an issue with some fans. Who knows what the future will hold if the Snyder Cut actually does come out and is reviewed more favorably than the version we got?,1
"“*Wingardium leviosa*” - science fiction quote, apparently.",1
"I'm assuming he thinks you mean JL, and hence he thinks there are three, the third being the Elfman one.",1
I think this happened because this version of Bruce was worn out mentally. The guy has been fighting crime for 20 years and he lost his Robin. Then with what happened in Metropolis when Zod and Superman faught just put him down that path. The destruction those two caused posed a much greater threat than any Gotham villian ever.,2
"I'll take 20 jars of piss over Flash falling into Diana's chest, the Super monstrosity, Diana being reduced to Steve Trevor's widow and The Batman acting like a 10 year old any day.",3
Hollywood hates redheads apparently.,1
Shit you already knew doesn't matter.  What matters is that someone with verified proof is saying these things.    From a large platform.  To the masses.  While other journalists are spouting bits about Snyder leaving before filming wrapped and other nonsense.  Im 90%+ sure you didn’t read this thing,3
I will!,1
Legend has it it's still climbing.,2
"The Ultimate Edition, that is.",3
So immature,0
"Or something more simple: when Superman drops Batman and flies away, have Flash zoom in to see if Bruce is okay and have say ""Wow, uh, you're definitely bleeding.""",2
For that Wayne Truck cameo.,3
He was teased from Umberto Gonzales,3
That or maybe they're floating the news around to test the waters while using Deadline to give them plausible deniability for either decision.,1
"You and me both, my guy..or gal. I think there’s a lot more fans than you think, that would love to see Snyder’s vision for JL.",2
I mean If I'm honest Whedon Supes did feel more like a fully formed Supes,1
"A few, sure. The difference there is they've done the homework to create both a strong overarching storyline, and the individual storylines of the movies. The development is generally strong and the effect work and action are generally tighter.   DC just hasn't put the work in there: it's like they keep changing game plans and throw whatever they have against the wall.  It's so fucking frustrating to see them squander these properties that are the most well-known superheroes in the world.  Truthfully, I kind of want somebody better to buy them out and show them how to do it.   That said, Joker may be the way out of this, but i don't have faith in them to do it.  Hell, if they had thrown money at Nolan to do the rest of the universe it would have done them so much good. They squandered the good faith that the Dark Knight series gave them.  The old ""Marvel is better than DC"" argument from the 70s shouldn't still hold up, but sadly it does in the cinema Universes.  Edit: Reddit's same old problem: try to have a real discussion that doesn't suck the dick of the sub and it's: ""LALALA ICANNOTHEARYOUICANNOTHEARYOU"".  DOWNVOTE.    Be a little less brittle and don't just devote because "" I'm sad now"".",0
Goddamn it you're frustrating.,1
"He should have been an antagonist for the whole movie in Suicide Squad, would have been absolutely epic to see Batman through their eyes.",1
I love AoU,2
Aquaman was critically mixed. Joker will only give WB 50 percent of the profits and is critically mixed. WW was critically acclaimed but couldn't beat BvS. Shazam was critically acclaimed but barely made 340mil.,0
"God, I hope Black Adam has a wayyy better costume than Shazam.",0
I'm not being biased. And there are facts that refute your claims too. So don't go and spout off facts when you you're only looking at the one end of it all.,0
Noooo remember RelEasE SnYDer CuT!!!! 😂😂😂 Directs a terrible movie then he is surprised when the studio cut him off lol,0
"Not a fan of reducing Brainiac to the name of a ship, least of all for the Dominators.   Speaking of, the Arrowverse already did the dominator invasion thing. We don’t really need to see that again.",2
I mean ngl this is pretty obvious cos Jesse stresses those words but whatever,1
He's probably Batman of the Birds of Prey timeline since they never really showed him on that show back in the day. I doubt they'd retcon the Donnerverse by saying Batman existed this whole time!,1
Movie details,1
Amazing. I really hope this means something. Great to hear he’s never lost his passion for the role. And probably the only reason he hasn’t said anything about the RTSC on Instagram is that he’s negotiating and playing it safe with WB.,1
"I knew he knew who both he and clark were after the first viewing of the Ultimate cut, and I always look to his slapping Clark at the party and telling Bruce not to pick a fight with this guy.  Which was him warning him not to pick a fight with Superman.",3
Is this a self comment?,2
"Lately THR has been very speculative, I only have blind faith on Variety, Vanity Fair, RS or Deadline.  And this makes more sense, because one week after getting released no one knew that the film was going to cross $1B.",1
It's too busy looking.,3
"Thor is still around though and Doctor Strange has a fair amount of attraction to it, as well as black panther 2 and guardians 3",1
GODDAMMIT,3
"Depends on the characters. Batman and most of his allies and rogues fit into realism pretty well. Just about any other DC character with mystical/alien/voodoo powers, probably not as much.",1
That's what happens with all the Star Wars films.,1
I'm pretty sure Keanu is going into the MCU as Kevin Feige has been after him for a while. I say he goes in both because why not. Utilize this man as much as possible,1
Start a kickstarter to fund the original design. I'll bring my monies.,2
I assume you've read the title of the movie.,1
If it’s as lame as the first one...,0
The Rock probably has a lot of star power. He is guaranteed money. If he wants Cavill in his movie he could probably get it. That may sway WB to take a look at getting more of Cavills Superman out there. So in a way he could have had a hand in them taking another look at Snydercut outside the movement.   Cavill deserves almost as much Justice for JL as Zack. They butchered my boys face on screen. It will never be forgotten and will never go away. Its a stain on his portfolio of work. That is unless they really step up their Superman game and put out some fantastic Superman material going forward. IF the Snydercut is well received that could be the first step in the right direction since it will at least mean no more fucked up lip for him.,2
That's how it always seemed intended and the consistent future movies coming out still clearly connected to the shared universe proved this.  Just a bunch of people here seem to think doomsaying cynicism is the same as being smarter than other people or something.,2
The butt cave is worth the price of admission,2
"Nah, they'd be fine if a Marvel flick on Best Pic (do you remember the hard-on they had for Black Panther a few years back?)",1
"it's an interesting theme throughout the film, especially with regards to Bruce - it's fun to see when Snyder shoots him ascending or descending into the frame.   Young Bruce is lifted into the light by bats like an angel in the Beautiful Lie sequence.   But then, as adult Bruce, he descends into the Batcave in the lift. Later, when battling Superman, he descends down into the basement, literally hitting rock bottom pretty much.   But then towards the end he begins to rise again. In the warehouse scene he comes up through the floor. In the final sequence, after witnessing Superman's sacrifice, he comes up through the ground and rubble.   The only thing that messes this up is the scene in the sex traffickers house - there he escapes upwards. So maybe it doesn't work lol. But an interesting theme nonetheless, and clearly intentional in some scenes, especially the painting.",3
Cassandra and that smug aura lol.,3
I heard Dr Fate and Isis will be introduced in Black Adam.,2
"I’m really looking forward to the batman film but, after recently discovering a wider range of DC characters through Injustice 2, I’ve got to say that I think a Jaimie Reyes Blue Beetle film has the potential to be a surprise hit for many reasons",1
Because TDK helped create the climate that consistently sees $1B comic book movies become a thing. Before 2008 hitting $1B was extremely rare and now it happens fairly frequently but only really for comic book movies and Star Wars.,1
"That's not what I was getting at. What I'm talking about is the habit of some studios/filmmakers start one movie and use that one movie to set up sequels and spinoffs and prequels and alternate universes. BvS stopped in the middle of it's narrative to go ""wink-wink, nudge nudge look at the other movies we're planning to make!"" rather than just making the one good movie.  Christopher Nolan did ""one for you, one for me"" with WB in between the Dark Knight films. He made one movie at a time and it shows.",2
"> I am not being disrespectful to those creators.  >We have fucking Pattinson as Batman man which is a disgrace  Your inconsistency is amazing. And no, MOS and BVS were not that profitable in the grand scheme. If they were, Snyder's vision wouldn't have been abandoned.",2
"He specifically said which Batman, not which Batman movie.",1
I agree completely. For some reason I still enjoy it but admit it has flaws!,0
That would have the perfect set up for BvS.,1
"Regardless, it’s insane to point to that one single example and now assume that every interview is just made up.",1
I'm pretty sure it will thousand times better than the load of turd that Snyder dropped that we called DCEU.,0
And people should realize that films are subjective.,1
Ship it!,1
Wow you get depressed so easily by something that pleases others. You should life check yourself,3
I'd like to think it'll be darker and more slower paced to fit with the noir detective style. Both of Zimmer's bat themes are amazing but they fit a more action based Batman,2

"I mean, there’s been an influx of Snyder related news so of course.",2
"The only thing I hold against it is the exposition is a little heavy. We see/are told about the destruction of Krypton three times. The scientist needing to give the textbook definition of “terraforming” to a high ranking member in the army. Other than stuff like that, it was great.",0
"It is, after all, a very big brain film. Pa Kent suicide for doggie, very smart. Watching justice league YouTube vids on plane, too clever. Martha, only savants can dream to decipher the character depth.",3
"I loved lex jr. He killed it in my eyes   It was such a smart idea having lex be this young, smug, mark Zuckerberg type",1
Came on just to say this. Aquaman isn’t even in the same league as Joker or TDK. Hell I thought Shazam was a way better movie than Aquaman.,2

"Ironically the MCU barely reflects the comics. Thor, Spider-Man and Hulk (Especially Hulk, dear lord) stand out as characters aren’t like their comic iterations beyond the superficial. This isn’t always bad (Except Hulk. My word Bruce what happened?). But it’s not a valid criticism is my point.",2

"Check your zipper because your racism is showing.   Superman is an alien from Krypton and can be any actor. The reason he’s been white is bc he was created in 1938. Maybe it’s time he gets an update. Why not just get the best actor to play Superman. If Henry Cavill or WB can work it out, why not keep him. If WB wants to go a different direction why not update Superman?",1
"A. I like watchmen fine, but it totally misses the point of the graphic novel. Visually it’s great though!  B. Are you joking?

wow. this is exactly why i shud not be continue in this conversation. So your problem is because the film never shown it in detail that she is unconscious to indicate that she is incapacitated even though it is obviously she didn been seen around for short while after get blasted off. This is exactly why I have problem with most of your criticisms. Either it is too sublte or lack of details or too spoonfeeding in certain things. Your argument is always borderline nitpicky on whole other level. And then with your how story shud have been done in order to make it believable in accordance to you  Also no offense i find you very arrogant when you dictate what is basic filmmaking skill or what you think is best for the audiences. Just who are you to decide on all this im not interested to know  I'm stopping here. I got other better things to do than to engaged in this conversation. I have no time or energy want to continue.   Apologize in advanced if i'm being too harsh,1

"It's a shame that this tragedy happened.  Snyder's Justice League would have made $3.5 billion at the box office, at least.  And that's just domestic.    Leaving Endgame and the other Marvel trappings to gather dust.",0
That is a good look. Damn.,3
"Superman Returns is definitely superior to Josstice League. At least it's a cohesive movie from one man's vision.  I think SR had a lot of potential that was squandered in terms of story execution and miscasting (Kate Bosworth, while she would have been fine as a ""young"" Lois Lane, was definitely not believable as an older Lois Lane who had been in a relationship with Superman and had a five-year old kid).  Making a semi-sequel to Superman II wasn't the issue. It was more so the fact that the story wasn't willing to risk fulfilling its own premise: What if Superman returned to a world that moved on without him? That answer is literally settled within 40 minutes of the film: The world instantly welcomes him back with open arms and the only ones who are salty about it are his ex-girlfriend and arch enemy. If the world actually reacted to Superman's return with indifference, uncertainty and even anger, then it would give Superman an interesting conflict to deal with.   Singer set up in interviews how Superman was returning to a Post-911 world, so something like that would be a dramatic question Superman would struggle with: ""Where were you when we needed you most?""   The very synopsis for SR prior to release set the story up as a ""redemption"" story and that just never came to fruition:   ""Following a mysterious absence of several years, the Man of Steel comes back to Earth in the epic action-adventure [***Superman Returns***](https://movieweb.com/movie/superman-returns/), a soaring new chapter in the saga of one of the world's most beloved superheroes. While an old enemy plots to render him powerless once and for all, Superman faces the heartbreaking realization that the woman he loves, Lois Lane, has moved on with her life. Or has she? Superman's bittersweet return challenges him to bridge the distance between them while finding a place in a society that has learned to survive without him. In an attempt to protect the world he loves from cataclysmic destruction, Superman embarks on an epic journey of redemption that takes him from the depths of the ocean to the far reaches of outer space.

"To those calling fake, They would have recieved these designs in early 2016.  Green Lantern is a given   There is literally pre vis of BvS Steppenwolf floating on the internet (I know Zack later changed it   Flashpoint Batman could have very likely happened in a short time travel sequence with the Flash hinting towards his movie OR it's a case like the Suicide Squad Joker hot toy wearing a Batman costume - just done for fun.   Cyborg also has a lot of validity because his hot toy was flat out cancelled all together. The only league member without one.    So yes, all very possible. You people who dont collect these dont realise these figures often come out A YEAR or more after the movies release. They take forever to finalize.  He could very well be full of shit, but it's also all at least probable",2
All of those things come with happiness and hope.,1
I get your POV but most actors would do bad under bad direction and a bad script. If you never heard of death note beforehand and just saw the movie you might’ve just been indifferent to his performance because he did well with what he was told to do.,1
*What* color pallet?,0
"Most villains don't have the depth for standalone movies. They took the biggest and probably one of the most well known villains in entertainment (Joker), that doesn't mean it works for every fucking villain.",1
"I’m sure we will see them again in the future :). Maybe a distant future, but I’m sure we will. Gal is still WW and second movie coming in 2020, and I’m sure they will do a third, Henry, as far as I’m concerned, is still Superman, and we will get PatBat :).",1
100% this.,1
Michael Wilkinson. I couldn’t tell you the name of any other costume designer. I think that says a lot about what he created.,2
Would’ve loved it in JL!,1
understandable if you don’t care about mcu movies,3
"If Phillips has more stories to tell he's definitely earned the chance to make more. I remember how adamantly people opposed the idea of a Joker solo film and now it's a critical and financial success. More importantly, I loved the movie.  I'm happy to see what Phillips does next. Maybe it'll flop, maybe it'll be great. If we don't give creatives the room to experiment we'll never get surprised by great movies, and yes, that means risking failure as well. It always does.",2
"When this info is produced by Forbes in the way that he writes it, yea.  Bombshell.",1
Finally someone calling out those “It DoesNt ExiSt” people. Absolutely insufferable.,2

"The UC is great. It adds in so many scenes that develop the characters and world and makes the plot whole.  The TC rearranged many scenes and sequences that the UC corrects  If you’re still not convinced, I recommend this:   https://youtu.be/IslGylvkjPE",3
"You need Superman and Batman to be huge part in the movie. Fucking Katana wouldn't fill this void...(and I don't think she should be in the team when u have HUGE DC characters  that are yet to be introduced to the team such as Green Arrow,Martian Manhunter,Blue Beetle,Hawkmam,Green Lantern,Firestorm,Black Canary). I think Atom should be Ray Palmer. Ryan Choi could be his intern as a nice easter egg/possible future down the line.  Part IV should be huge. Darkseid should not be the villain. Needs to be a threat to the greater DC Universe..something that'll include The JLA,JSA,JLD,Teen Titans..like Nekron/Trigon.",1
The bit with Arthur and the Waynes actually made me tear up a bit. Also I loved how the villains at the end were all time appropriate.,2
Yessssir,2
"> Snyder's JL was always going to be more optimistic dude.   You misunderstand.  The film would have been so bad that it would have been depressing to watch, imo. The guy was given hundred of millions of dollars and couldn't make a good Batman/Superman film with it. I have absolutely no faith that he could have pulled off Justice League, and neither did the studio.",0
"I'm always surprised when people pick Emilia for all these roles. I'm probably gonna get a lot of heat for this...she's too chubby. She played Sarah Conner, you know the absolutely ripped soldier and looked like the only war she had fought was for the last pie.",0
Sigh* unzips pants,3
A Superman that inspired a bully to be a friend and an enemy to be an ally throughout the film. I don’t see how you can get a “better take” on Superman unless you really wanted him to save a cat perhaps before he saved the world.,1

BvS itself was next level.,3
Just have the sequel be Joaquin Phoenix playing out a different origin for the joker. Making it multiple choice,1
Yea we'd much rather Lex and Superman be at odds over real estate!,2
IMO the only really comparable aspect to the Donner Cut is that they are both DC based films that differ from their theatrical cuts. It’s a totally different situation.,1
"This is why DC will continue to suck balls  They don’t have a plan and because of that they only had a couple good movies and lots of sub par ones   Love or hate them marvel studios had a plan and spent a decade building out a universe and keeping the same actors and introducing many minor characters along with the long time popular ones   In that time we’ve gotten what out of DC?  Batman Begins, Dark Knight and Man of Steel were excellent, the rest not worth mentioning They’ve at least had better animated movies and a few series, justice league dark and Constantine  were great  The only decent marvel series was the punisher",0
Can we just take a moment to mention that ***THOSE SURE AS SHIT LOOK LIKE COMPLETED EFFECTS TO ME?!??!?!!?***  Guess all the haters saying it’s unwatchable can fuck off,2
"I’m all for it. If they think they have a good idea for a sequel, I’ll trust them.",1
I never said he wrote the script. He didn't write any DCEU scripts.,1
He wants to stay but ultimately the decision is WB.,2
"He's a great Superman, we just need better writing for him. I can't wait for the future of DCEU. I hope they won't make a new Justice League until Green Lantern is introduced. I really hope we get to see Henry Cavill then.",3
"Lmao, the real trinity is Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor.",0
"That's what the ""etc."" is for, too many to list them all.",2
It's almost like the media outrage against BvS wasn't actually representative of everyone.  Oh wait.,1
"i just bought it and watched it in full for the first time 2 days ago; i honestly liked the theatrical cut, but the ultimate edition was just so much better",1
"Awful. And when they did, ""is she with you"" came out of batman's mouth lol. Just awful.",0
"Didnt say that Joker had subtle themes.   However, A lex luthor movie pointing it's fingers directly at US politics might bring unnecessary controversy.  Todd Philips can explore that grey area where he can include some good criticism on politics without taking sides.",3
So I'm not allowed to agree with you?     That's illogical.,1
Definitely:  [https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Before-and-after-Steppenwolf-concept-art-for-Justice-League.jpg](https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Before-and-after-Steppenwolf-concept-art-for-Justice-League.jpg),1
"But this is Snyder's point. The shooting one thing but through fighting, Batman would've killed many people, or disabled them permanently.",1
it seems like 4 movies were cut out of this movie at this point.,1
Superman isn’t white. He’s a goddamn alien.,0
" >If peter Jackson left during Return of the King and they brought in Michael Bay to ""finish"" the movie but instead dude decided to shorten the movie and make it ""flow"" better by adding 20 explosion.  And firing Howard Shore and having Randy Newman compose a new soundtrack.",1
in all 3 movies,0
"I want to give you five more upvotes.  Yes, it seems that so-called ""comic book fans"" don't actually have a problem with Batman killing, but they are uncomfortable about how the movie showed the unintended consequences of a vigilante going out at night and ""exacting justice.""    The film is a deconstruction of both characters, it shows that people are dying from his lethal force but Bruce is losing his way to realize it.  The point is to get to why this man does what he does, and what drives him.  It's the Watchmen approach, and if you don't like it, fine.  But it's still out of respect and love for the characters.",3
Just because someone is a great character actor doesn’t mean they can play every character great.,0
I figured. I just want a surprise Dick Grayson announcement.,2
I never said it was but he def knows if it’s got the potential to happen or not. If not he should set the record straight.,2
The empty theater demographic?,2
Stabbed a dude in the shoulder and threw a crate at a group that happened to hit a guy,1
I'm sure WB has done a fine job of that internally. And they've made some good movies since JL.  There's no step in your process that requires **us** to see the Snyder Cut.,1
"If Snyder made this movie, it woiod be all blood and gore, no story and would be a massive flop. Arthur would be a psycho killer.",1
"You know what. You guys are right. It’s zack Snyder’s fault.  He’s got the look, just wish they let him be better",1
"Nothing preventing it other than priorities.  Is it worth the time and money to update the design?  Not a VfX artist, but it may also not be as simple as a cut-n-paste of one design vs the other, if there are size and shape differences to the character model.   Also, possible creative-related question: did the approach to Steppenwolf’s dialogue or voice acting change with the design change?",1
Good thing it’s not trash.,3
Is MoS really hard to understand? Maybe an average movie viewer won't get some of the themes but it doesn't take much thought to fully understand the movie.,3

Whoa! I never caught that!,1
Zack: So remember that epic sequence with the Amazons? Let's fucking do that underwater!,3
I don’t care if his heat vision has lens flares. Please give me Cavill as Superman!!!!! Please!!!!,1
"I'd love to see this, but I do not think we'll get it. The writers in charge now seem to favor the direction where Harley breaks up with the Joker and gets to be in the spotlight on her own as revealed by the Birds of Prey trailer. I don't see them backtracking on that. The current DCEU will probably fizzle out as soon as the Pattinson Batman movie and the JJ Abrams Superman (?) project starts up. I think WB will keep making Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Harley, and Shazam sequels until Battinson and Superman are on solid footing, then, if that's a success, they'll try for the shared universe thing again. But with WB, who honestly knows. They seem to have no real plan so I imagine they'll do whatever they think will make them money.",1
Chill out. They didn't accidentally make a great movie.,3
"Witchcraft, I say!",2
"He can't finish his dinner let alone a good story. His stuff either comes to an abrupt end, or is literally unfinished, imo.",1

You might want to start watching flims outside of capeshit.,2
This gives me anxiety.,3
...Because it was bad? Like BvS and JL and how many view MOS.,1
"You can have that opinion. Maybe you’re missing something, maybe I’m reaching, but the fact that this discussion is even happening is one way to distinguish art and entertainment",1
"I totally agree with that scene being a credit scene makes more sense (also, why would batman have a hard-on for just this one alien when he clearly knows there are bunch of meta humans out there)  but, the movie is more about the media and humanity as a whole, men struggling wih power and their intrepretation of power rather than the the characters in them",1

"I didnt care for rocks black adam but if it gonna have doctor fate, <thats something else.",1
I mean weren’t the Hawkman rumors started like this as well and now everyone on this sub seems to be running with it.,3
"I'd argue the attention to Batman Begins caused it, and the result was TDK which went super saiyan with it. Iron Man came out before it and that definitely took cues from giving a good origin treatment and not being shy with a realistic setting, as did a few franchises when it came to restarting everything, and of course superhero franchises. Daredevil wouldn't get off the ground again at Fox because the persistence for wanting something in the vein of Nolan's vision with BB was of importance at the time.",2
"It was more of a response to Rays comment. Zack releasing pics doesn’t make it any less of a pipe dream. He can post all the pics he wants, until WB changes their minds it won’t amount to squat.",0
"I wanted the movie to end right there, there was no need of that last Scene of him in an asylum!",1
The details say that they are not the same girl any way!,2
But it's still her ass \*\_\*,0
"I know what you were saying.. that is just one of many depictions, anyway. Personally, I think it looks shit. But, to each his own.",1
"People didn't buy into it because they're still hung up on the Christopher Reeve's Superman who killed but he did it with a smile on his face Based off of the premise of the movie, there was no prison to hold Zod in. The phantom zone was closed and Clark had no way at the time to know how to open it back up again. The set up of Zod being purposeless and angry and wanting to cause pain to Clark for erasing the very reason for his existence is plenty of reason to believe he would lash out in a manner that would make Clark make the ultimate decision. It's a coherent story.  Maybe you didn't like the destruction as a byproduct of their battle, and there were opportunities to showcase Clark being shook by the destruction as a byproduct of him trying to stop Zod, but logically the final battle makes sense and him killing Zod was a reasonable action",1
She's dragging Johnny Depp through the mud and its known that she lied about it and has a history of being abusive to her partners,3

I came to this thread for this exact exchange.,3
"Imagine only watching Snyder DC films that you don’t even realized Geoff Johns is involved in Titans which is anything but “light hearted Marvel” and that Berlanti has produced Titans, Doom Patrol, and the first two seasons of Arrow",2
why are we talking about Amazing Spider man?,1
"They aren’t discarded takes. The film was picture locked since January. We know he’s worked on VFX since pre production and he had months of post production. The score is complete. The only question is just how much of the VFX is left, those who worked on the film say it’s close to being done while recently Jason Momoa has implied that it IS done.",2
Okay? How is that relevant to my feelings about it?,1
Is he lying or just ignorant?,2
MoS was good but the pacing was a bit slow and the biblical imagery was a tad too heavy. Other than that it was a good Superman origin.,1
It's what the Minutemen is to Watchmen.,1
Wild Prediction: Renee Montoya will be the best character in the film.  I also think while  Black Canary is being criticized the hardest by fans she’ll be the breakout star.,3
"Cool! I love the belt. If we can’t get the briefs, the belt breaks up the suit nicely.",3
Some people don’t get that Henry doesn’t say anything about the SC because he actually doesn’t want to do anything with that film anymore. He had shared his disappointment to his character’s arc in JL until Geoff Johns came in and he said that he and Geoff tried to bring Superman from the comicbooks which again didn’t work as Henry recently said.   Henry just wants a soft reboot of his character with a new movie and probably hopes a director wants to do that with him. I hope for that too.,0
Ya we’ve been down this road before. There’s no way they hold off this long and come back with the same actor. Unless something falls into place fast he’s clearly done.,3
For every person here that claims they would subscribe for the Synder cut there's another 9 that outright aren't even pretending they would or are flat out lying by saying they will subscribe and are actually just going to watch the movie online for free when it inevitably gets leaked.  It really isn't the business decision people here want to think it is.,0
"I'm glad Whedon didn't get to make a Batgirl movie.  The ""thirsty"" bit and the boob falls wouldn't have been the half of it.   Even if he was working to a studio mandate to make the film short, light, and not leading to a canceled sequel, there was no excuse for some of the shit he put in.",3
"The fact that this apparently 'needs' to be emphasised and apparently 'needs' be in a version which suits you, means we can't have nice things like Snyder's vision.  I mean holy fuck, 'sorry guys we don't want to see Zacks epic tale and vision of supes and justice league - because we want to see him lift up a rock and save that bug, or grab the cat from the tree'... Wow. Can we not have both?. Can you not just watch your donner movies please. Superman deserves better.",0
Non-Disclosure Agreement. Basically stops them from discussing stuff that is either in production or going to be in production. It's a way to stop leaks until the production company is ready for them.,2
This is a sub for all DC related info. There are fans here that love everything or something about DC. we all wanna share or talk about what’s happening and right now this is a hot topic. The reason there are so many posts about this is because majority like to talk about the Snydercut and are fans. So no let’s not stop because a few are getting upset. Don’t like it keep scrolling. This shouldn’t make you suffer in life,1

"That is pretty great. Not a fan of the movie, but that is pretty great.",2
so hot,1
"THR and Variety both threw cold water on the prospects of the Snyder Cut. To say that one dubious Forbes scooper (and Forbes online, by the way, does not retain the same journalistic standards as Forbes Magazine, anyone can be an online Forbes contributor) should be trusted over 2 of the 3 premier Hollywood trades is textbook confirmation bias.",0
"The reshoots were GOING to happen. Snyder was out. WB screened the rough cut for several filmmakers to get input on how to reshape it and morph it into what WB wanted.  Whedon simply won the bid for $3m. If he had said no, there were about 6 other teams ready to do the reshoots. They were GOING to happen regardless.",2
This makes my heart go wild.,2
">These are the only ones that most of the RTSC supporters including me have absolutely no clue about.  >There is no leaked images, no confirmations.  > >Jesse Eisenberg said he had 2-3 scenes that didnt make into the theatrical cut.  >But the details are unknown.    One thing you have to bear in mind is that (and these are absolute fact):  - Lex had to have some introduction to Deathstroke in the film (so that the boat isn't the first time they meet, which is a bit odd in isolation).  - Lex had to get out of Arkham's secure unit somehow.   - Lex had some (but only a couple of) scenes filmed that weren't shown.   So even with absolutely no proper evidence, I'd say there's a very, very strong body of circumstantial evidence to suggest that Deathstroke busted him out. Otherwise, what are the scenes that introduce him to Deathstroke, and how does he get free?",3
The boss is feeding us today.   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
The DCEU has generally had a very high standard of acting talent associated with it. Just hoping the script delivers on the promise. And Grace and go do one,1
"Of course they are a tiny minority, thank god for that. But they are the loudest, most vocal minority, and they definitely have more visibility on social network (because they have nothing else to do, and because of the controversial nature of their speech), which guarantees counter-reactions from fans, and from online ppl in general.  But let's not pretend that people who made fun of Autumn's suicide were the only one mocking BvS online, the movie received *torrents* of undue criticisms, most of which also criticizing the plot, character, editing, design. And even without seeing abominations like aforementioned people, I can't recall the number of ""hack snyder"" posts, and people who generally describe him as the bane of the DC banner, and saying that BvS is literally the worst cbm to have ever been made. Yes, worse than Batman & Robin, worse than Catwoman, worse than Thor 2. And that's even after the UE was released. Unrelenting, as I said.  I liked TLJ (and I know I'll be downvoted to hell for that) but that's not the point, the point is that Johnson is much more relatable in that aspect. I defy anyone to produce an art work (of any kind - music, movie, painting...) , get trashed on a personal level for 2 YEARS by people watching it, and not lose your temper about it, not once. Yes it's like an adult trying to tackle children because every day for 2 years, these children wait in front of his door and throw snowballs at him with mean intentions. That kind of children needs to be scolded too, and the adult tackles them because it's the only language many of them understand.   The metaphor isn't even justified, because we're talking mostly about adults, some older than Rian Johnson, but most still behave like uneducated children. It's their fault, not his.",0
"It wouldn't bother me that much. I love Zack Snyder's movies so I'm really hoping to see what he did with JL. Man of Steel is one of my favourite comic book films. As it is now, JL is the only DCU movie I don't have on blu-ray.",3

If this is how they market to us, allowing us to see the fruits of a successful 2 year campaign, then that to me is a whole hell of a lot more fun than the standard: announcement of a teaser, a teaser, an announcement of a trailer, a trailer, a second trailer, 2 TV spots and then a release.  This is far more exciting than the usual marketing model, now that they've clearly decided to greenlight it in some form.",1
im going with the theory WB is trying to wash their hands of anything synder related,1
I'm yet to see Justice League,2
"Or people who just liked the movie enough to see it multiple times, lol. In fact, if you're talking solely about the fans deciding the fate of the new Batman (they won't), Batfleck is not a good example anyway since BVS and Justice League both underperformed at the box office (with the former having very poor legs).   If we're talking pure dollars and cents, both Batman 89 and the two Nolan sequels were much more popular with ""the fans"" by that logic.",1

"It could be argued that without comparisons to Justice League or any other movie, their were flaws in Batman V Superman that outshined the thematic work. So that it wasn’t overlooked as much as overshadowed by other choices, maybe narratively, maybe something else.   I wasn’t aware that it was literally disliked by critics more than Justice League though. In my opinion that sounds like a mistake, I’d have to see the reviews to try and workout why that is though.",1
"No, it isn't. Jared Leto appeared in only one movie.",1
Well no shit they didnt plan any reshoots. Why did Henry decide  to grow a moustache,3
Honestly I think the issue with the score was time mostly.  I think if there was more time and collaboration with maybe Junkie or Hans we could have gotten an amazing soundtrack,1
"Grace: when you make contact with water you will get wet  Fanatics jumping in pool: man grace was right , I didnt think it would happen.   The rest of us: the fuck?",2
I get a medieval feeling from this,3
DUTCH!,1
"See I don't think snyder needed reshoots at that point, I could be very wrong though. But I hear what you are ssying, I think the divorce and alcoholism were taking it's toll around that time.",1
"No offense but Snyder fans need to realise that they are an incredibly small portion of the overall audience, an audience that clearly didn't take to Snyder's vision of the DCEU which cost WB hundreds of millions of dollars and they have been trying to distance the movies from it ever since.     The question isn't what are WB afraid of, the question is why would they want to spend time and resources on something they are trying to move on from when they are focusing on a future that has nothing to do with Snyder?",3
"Batman has killed people in literally every movie. He cracks a smile when he blows a guy up in returns. He also has killed in multiple comics, even when he has had his ""no kill"" rule he still brutalizes and cripples countless people. We should feel better he will break someone's spine rather than kill them? I mean c'mon. He allows ras aghul to die and is directly responsible for the events that cause his death. He was soo adamant he couldn't kill the prisoner with the league of shadows yet he burns the fucking building down lol. While this prisoner is still restrained and more than likely stuck in there. The bvs interpretation was very much in line with TDKR version of the character. Him being wreck less and violent was literally the point and wasn't supposed to be seen as a good thing. He was supposed to be seen as a seriously damaged Batman losing his way.",1
Umm   Green lantern Martian Manhunter And the Hawks??,0
Then how do you explain Wonder Woman and Aquaman?,0
"You did it in a nice way, so I appreciate that 😁🤙",2
"I just love this. Some people were thinking that Henry was the “smart one” by not siding with Snyder, but apparently he preferred what Snyder did than what WB did with JL lol",2
"Snyder's Atlantian Design looks so much better than James Wan's. Way more realistic and ""dirty"".",1
Not everything has to be a trilogy . I’d much prefer her to take on MOS 2 then a third WW . I say that having faith that WW84 will probably be amazing,0
I’m not looking forward to Pattinsons Batman and I loved the skinny animated Batman series lol,0
Not with Zack. He gets things done early.,2
Yea. In Aquaman they were explained though. Snyder dis it first with a purpose he couldn’t realize so he just went with the bubble. And honestly I think this looks fucking bomb. The one in josstice league looks like shit.,2
"It all started during MoS, when he was jealous that he couldn't get his grubby paws all over Snyder's movie.  Of course he moved up the ranks of DC Entertainment as the movies continued, until after BvS he shot up the ladder because he was seen as the ""comics expert.""  There was growing opinion amongst critics, journalists, and bloggers that the Snyder DC movies weren't accurate to who DC heroes were in the source material, and plugging in Johns was somehow the answer to this so-called ""dilemma.""    What they, including Geoff Johns don't understand is that Snyder was portraying the heroes exactly as they were originally designed.  Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are not close to the same light as characters like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, or the Hulk.  DC's heroes are closer to religion than Marvel's, mythological figures who are whatever we need them to be in the modern world.  They should tell the collective story of humanity.  It's clear to see this when looking at Zack's planned arc: birth, loss of innocence, death, resurrection, uniting the land, punishment, restoration.    More so than his blatant misunderstanding of DC's superheroes is his attitude towards film making.  Refusing to acknowledge Snyder's contributions, tag him with other DC directors, or let him make his movies from a singular vision just speaks to his arrogance.  I still can't believe WB handed the ""car keys of hope"" to a yuppie who still worships Richard Donner after all these years, taking cheap shots at Snyder while hiding like a coward behind his ball cap.    Good riddance to the snake in the grass.  Hopefully now we get to see the Snyder Cut, and even then it's changed from Zack's original plans.",0
I'd rather take Ben Hardy (Physically not the accent) but Ezra is so in love with The Flash that he'll want to keep the part .. even if he has others priorities,0
"Yeah, that’s how it went for all the movies. So you’re not adding anything to your argument.",2
what happened with Age of Ultron?,2
"It's not terrible (Better than CM by far). Just confused. It reminds me of Josstice League with the meddling, but not nearly as jarring. They at least made the reshoots flow better with the original stuff in DP. Josstice League has jarring inconsistencies just between film scenes and digital scenes.",0
"Oh lord Jesus. 80 pages? For a shooting script, that's a lot.",3
Oh my fuck this is amazing.,2
"Something else that Jay said recently that I did not know. Snyder said in his behind the scenes stuff that Batman shot a mutant in the head in The Dark Knight Returns and people claim he didn’t understand it and use that to show how he doesn’t understand the characters. However, Jay says he believes he shot the mutant in the head too, but he just didn’t want to pursue it in his film.",3
Yeah. I loved Aquaman since the natural charisma of the actors and general directing made the script mostly a non-issue (Much like the first Raimi Spiderman which also had a terrible script). But that shine only works for one movie. Hopefully we can get our Spiderman 2 equivalent.,2
Lol Honk Honk,1
These fuckers really thought that they could just sweep this under the rug and everyone would just eat up their Frankenstein JL.,3
Seems like a scene i would use to go to the bathroom on rewatches. Cuz that shits boring. And does nothing for me.   Idk how old yall are. But my Superman was never up in trees saving cats. He was too busy entertaining me on the page and on screen.,2
"They would do it if the film is successful.  As they do with any property, trying to make a follow up.  But it all depends on that fan response and money earned.  I don't think critics would even really be a factor this time around if it is just on HBO MAX.    Just times streamed and talk generated.",0
"Snyder bowed out after his daughter's tragedy, then WB brought in Joss Whedon to finish the movie.  He then rewrote it to be as trash as all of his other projects, so blame him, not WB. They had a release date to uphold.",0
From the rumors they want him back as constantine,1
"From The DC Comics Encyclopedia: “Egyptian Adrianna Tomaz was enslaved by intergang and gifted to Black Adam, the superpowered ruler of Kahndaq. Adam killed the criminals and set Adrianna free. Captivated by her courage, honesty, and desire for justice, Adam took her as his consort and gave her a mystic amulet that transformed her into the divinely empowered Isis.”",1
"I said ""more coherent"" compared to BvS. It's got its own share of plot holes i'm sure but Rubber Mask =Baron Zemo? If s9, what broke the avengers were the Sokovia Accords and Zemo caused a riff between Stark and Rogers by manipulating/exploiting their emotions regarding families.   BP was shown to be on Stark's aircraft when he took off to find Steve.                   >avengers",0
I feel like Reeves Joker will be some real outside of the box casting. Skarsgard is very uninspired and i feel like his Joker will be totally unique from previous iterations.,1
"For real. There are so many threads on here that after I end up feeling like I'm in r/Snyder or something. It's ridiculous the blind faith people have.   But I guess it's fair, it's hope and that's what superman is about",1
"Nolan saw it,because he was EP and he has a great track record with DC movies James Wan Patty Jenkins",2
3d is overrated,3
"I feel like Woody plays the “crazy psychopath” better than he plays the “calculating psychopath” role. I could see it, but I think someone else could be better.",1
"I think ditching the red trunks helped too, even though that probably would’ve been a nice touch too",3
There was a time not long ago on the sub where you couldn't say anything supporting Zack without being mobbed by haters and deniers... they all gone quite now,3
You know some ppl will find a way to bootleg it and sell it as a physical copy,2
"And that's why I'm sad we'll never see Leto and Affleck together on screen. Yeah sure the Bat is scary but Joker proved that after all he's just a guy dressed like a bat. That's why he wears his ""trademarks"" as tattoos and also why his strippers wear a Batman mask: he's mocking him.   But then again I guess this wasn't as interesting as his relationship with Harley Quinn. /s",1
"Until Deathstroke appears as a major villain in a cinematic release, I'm not sure he could do what *Joker* did at the box office.",1
"I think Bill could be a great Joker, but I doubt he’d tie himself to another clown.   As for Wallström, I don’t see it. He’s a good actor, but I don’t see him as Joker.",3
Here's the full comment.  https://twitter.com/Suhail_SeA/status/1199349029022224387?s=19,3

"Which has no relation to the posts on reddit. They don’t organize that. Some are even from people not part of the movement, just guys interested and curious. And these posts are happening because there is news about the cut, not out of nowhere. When the next big news about the other films comes out, there will be a bunch of posts about that.",1
"The new 52 issues 1-40. The Batman is the series he wrote. (That’s important because they branch out to multiple storylines).  The beginning is a warm up to joker ( very brief). Keep reading because he will make a return and the story is all relevant. There is the court of owls storyline. Still good but not in direct relation to joker. Then there is the death OF the family storyline. (New 52 is the reboot of DC. Meaning that these storylines are like a parallel universe to pre 2011). Then it’s going to follow some other storylines and come to a finish with Endgame.   This is a link to a reading order if you are interested.   https://medium.com/@justinbeeson/batman-by-snyder-capullo-reading-order-e8cf77e711fc  Also... both DC and Marvel decided to thread storylines together when they rebooted. Meaning it’s not like the old graphic novels that was reading a singularity. The new graphics novels are a bit tough if you are not prepared to be reading an insert with a reference to another issues from another persons storyline.  (During Snyder’s writing there is a  Batman’s storyline Night wing storyline  Batman and robin storyline Batgirl storyline  And they are all written by different people.)  This is hands down my top 5 favorite Batman stories and recommend anyone to read. However, I want to give you the benefit of knowing what you are getting yourself into.",3
I mean she had a role in Captain Marvel too right? Not impossible. Is Sersi a big character?,1
It looks much better than her Aquaman suit. Also the hair.,0
"I’ll say it. Time for a new Superman , Henry is... as emotive as a brick wall",0
"He didn’t huh? Where’s our Batman, Where’s our Superman, Where’s our Cyborg? Where’s our movies. Should I go on.",0
"They gave us near perfection with the MoS suit, and then it got worse in BvS and then worse again for JL.   They gave us an awesome Batsuit in BvS, and then messed it for JL.  Bummer.",2
"So let’s see Superman, Batman, Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg, Steppenwolf, Darkseid, Desaid, Lex Luthor, Deathstroke, Martian Manhunter, Mera, a Green Lantern, Ares, and possibly Atom nope Instead we got brunch, and a Russian family and breast jokes, and CGI lips and corny lines.",2
"And I'm glad that the dude who thinks that way is no longer in charge of these characters. Thank god, could you imagine a world where Shazam is killing folks? I love living in my dream world",1
"Same here. We don't need ""representation"". We have our own world of TV shows, Movies and culture. Why would we give a shit about a ficticious country being represented hahaha",1
"That would pull her off of WW3, so I’m not sure how I feel about that, but I’m confident in her ability as a director and would happily give her any property she wants.",1
He *has* to? He doesn't have to do anything just because some sweaty nerd on Reddit wants him to.,1
He only looks different because his hair is not CGI'd,1
">Especially Ray, Ezra, and Henry.  I dont know how Ezra has been treated badly by WB. If they wanted, they couldve recasted him and get the lighter version of the film that the director duo were gonna do. Instead they kept him as the character and still looking for a compatible director. And hes an important part in WB other biggest franchise: the wizarding world. WB seems to treat him with alot of preference",2
"Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, etc.",0
I figure his suspicions began with Bruce Wayne snooping around at his event. Not long after the Batman started getting involved in his businesses. It's a stretch but Bruce Wayne and Diana stole those files which contain highly confidential material which was then being used to sabotage his businesses,1
I also think it’s huge for Cavill’s future how Black Adam does itself. It’s being produced by the Rock and his team of the Garcia’s and they also represent Henry. If it’s a big hit (and from the way it sounds so far with Hawkman and the JSA and knowing the Rock’s superstar status it will probably be a box office hit) they’ll undoubtedly use that leverage to get Henry as Superman in the next one of their Black Adam/Shazam films. How his appearance in that film is received probably determines if he gets another solo movie. That’s what the most logical train of thought would be imo,1
"Damn, all you folks just having the big “A ha!!” moment now?   Shit was kinda obvious on first viewing, since Lex was engaging in that sort of wordplay throughout the film.  To quote another wordsmith, NYPD Detective John McClane, “WELCOME TO THE PARTY, PAL!!!!”",0
"This is pretty great, only thing is you forgot to mention the history lesson with Darkseid and other things like Atom and Martian Manhunter. But other than that this is great for people unaware.",2
almost spit my coffee out of laughing at ur comment.,2
Did I say it was good? No. I said it's a 1 second gag yet every rants about it for 2 years. Get over it.,0
> Having an alien actually look like an alien makes sense rather than just a human who supposedly knows English perfectly.  Uhhhh.... I take it you’re not a big fan of Superman then?,2
"I agree with you, I have never seen such a scary design as Steppenwolf's concept art. Everyone I showed it to who wasn't aware of superhero comics got scared. Doing something so ballsy is what I like about this design. Hopefully we get something like this in the Snyder Cut.",0
He even has the right features!,1
Heyoo!,2
">As for Star Trek however that's easily his masterpiece when it comes to rebooting a franchise. That movie is almost a 10/10 in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong I absolutely love his Star Trek, but I gotta disagree and go with Mission Impossible as his ""masterpiece"" of rebooting a franchise.  It's very close, but he brought that franchise back from the dead after MI2 to being a billion dollar franchise.  Star Trek he kind of just changed it to be more mainstream and kind of avoided their dreaded odd number movie curse.",2
"While I agree with you on it not being in the DCEU, that isn't actually true. Sadly those two other films are also in the Burtonverse.",1
Come on....just get this done WB!  They have the perfect casting for Superman right in front of their faces....Get. It. Done.,2
Is that possible without Superman/Superboy?,1
Who is the woman in blue? I'm guessing the one with the bat is Canary. Also not a huge fan of Harley's outfit,1
"Lex would make sense.   Lex and Joker are the top 2 DC villains and the DCEU versions of those two have been.......controversial, to say the least. With Joker now on a high, maybe WB would want Lex redeemed in the public eye.",1
Good to know!,1
Tbh it is a stretch but it fits a narrative so it's a Canon theory now,1
I miss secret identities,1
...said they currently have no plans. Plans can change 🤞,2
DC Comics isn’t the one making these decisions. If this headline is to be believed then this is all Warner Bros. and Todd Phillips. They’re the ones making the decisions on what to do with these characters.,1
He stated his opinion and people responded. That's what you get when you post on social media.,2
"I misinterpreted my bad. But yea you're right, the studio really shit the bed on this one .",1
Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter he proposed an outsized idea — the rights to develop a portfolio of DC characters' origin stories.  Everyone posting this story needs a reading lesson,2
Here's a great example of how not to do superman. Have you seen titans and their version of Superboy??. That. anything related to acts with an attempt at indeerment is fucking ridiculous. It does not belong on a big screen. What tone??? There was nothing wrong with Snyder's 'tOnE'. Still waiting to hear why/how it was so dark. All because he didn't save a cat from a tree?. Smfdh.,0
AT-ST AT-ST AT-ST!,1
"Lex Luther , mr freeze , 2face , scarecrow ?   Who else y’all want?",1
"I mentioned this further down the thread, but Justice League and Age of Ultron both mirror each other perfectly in how much Whedon fucked their scores. I almost feel bad for Elfman getting caught between Whedon and the public, as I feel he tends to catch all of the blame for it. He's absolutely responsible for how the scores ended up, but people really overlook just how much of a part Whedon had to play in how it unfolded.   There isn't a single track I'd say is actually good in Justice League. The only part that comes close is the heist scene with the  Wonder Woman reprisal, but it'd be liberal to say ""good"" for that, lol. It's annoying how we now know there's a complete score that'll almost definitively use all of the DCEU themes just sitting there collecting dust.",1
One of the things I was a little concerned with after Justice League... Clark Kent was buried. Everyone at the Daily Planet would know that. The world knows Superman was dead. Now they're BOTH back? How's he supposed to go back to being Clark Kent again?,1
"Weird, last time I saw a movie that even had 3D as an option was infinity war. Every other action blockbuster doesn't have it. My theater must be old school, or just cheap.",1
"It was a footnote in an article about the overall direction of DC, the headline said nothing about Snyder Cut. How was it desperately trying to get clicks?  If this article was word for word the same except for the blurb about the Snyder cut, you’d be championing Variety’s credentials as proof of its truth.  You’re humiliating yourself.",2
"If he's drawing from The Long Halloween, I wonder if they will go with the implication that Selina is Falcone's daughter, since Loeb and Sale implied that in several of their minis together.",3

"Fight, or action scenes? Because the best fight scenes are undoubtedly in BvS. The best action scenes, however, are still Nolan’s Batman for me. I don’t mind the sloppy fights as much and the vehicular action scenes are just breathtaking and haven’t been topped since, especially the whole chase that ends with the truck flip in TDK.",1
He never becomes Joker. Also Jared never said something like that. You read the rumours which were lies. They already said there wasn't a case like that.,1

"Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen",2
The Director's Cut of all of Snyder's films is always vastly superior. BvS is no different. It fills in some gaps and the pacing is much better.,1
"this is my opinion, remember 3 weeks ago when fabian wagner or junkie xl i forgot which one saying snyder ""representative"" goes to wb and has meeting for this issue. then someone create RTSC for people around the world to follow the twitt about #ReleaseSnydersCut.  not just that, jay oliva also said ""if you want wb exec listen to you this is the chance"" but someone from anti snyder blogger question about this but jay oliva said ""WB exec did use twitter and you think they didn't open their twitter especially in holiday (sunday 17 nov)?""  i assumed this meeting is about jason momoa met ann sarnoff, AT-T execs and toby emmerich to release snyder's cut but toby won't budge but ann sarnof ask if people really want it, show to us (wb exec) how many people who want through social media so jason momoa said yes if it hit more than certain amount of follows will snyders cut be released?  if they can make it  i don't know how many people should be follow RTSC twitter but they might ask around at least 500k follower and we got final result which is 780k follows",1

"No it kind of is because it helped with world building. World building opens up new franchises, new franchises means more actors, directors and other talent which then creates more opportunities for profit. And then you spiderweb from there. Now it's a bunch of seesawing projects that have no really sense of cohesion or focus which will only create shortsighted results. They are not brand building. Just profit building with initial burst and current successes. They are looking at the endgame profit of it. When you build a brand big enough.",0
"Well just when I think its impossible to be any more hyped for the SnyderCut, Zack drops another bomb and my hype level increases ten fold!",3
"While I agree with your sentiment, I HIGHLY doubt Elfman saw anything from the original cut - For the most part, why would he in the first place? The original cut is completely wrong for his music, and they definitely didn't have his score before or during the reshoots, so there's not really any logical reason he'd have seen the original cut. He was ostensibly scoring a different movie.  Momoa's quote when quizzed on the cut really makes me believe otherwise, as well. He gets directly asked about it, with the interviewer mentioning that the Snyder cut wouldn't be finished and has plenty of CGI and Momoa basically starts grinning cheek to cheek   ""Oh you think, you think Zack couldn't finish his film"",   ""I don't know, you tell me""  ""Well, you know that's the question isn't it""  Then he goes on to joke he might be fired for even saying that.  Any more and he'd be breaking his NDA. No hate to Elfman, man has done amazing work that I love, but I don't really care about his opinion - his job was to make a soundtrack last minute for a heavily re-edited film, I really don't think he had enough insider info to be countering what basically every other source who actually worked on the cut we're discussing has said.",1
"Arrow's first three episodes had some pretty awesome inner monologues. Constantine's first few episodes, too.",1

He proves that with every directors cut.",2
"His name is on the movie. They marketed it as his movie. If they wanted to man up, fire him, and change the movie, fine. You save yourself maybe 20% of a headache. The fervor derives in part from WB lying, using his stepping down due to personal tragedy as a cover, saying he picked Whedon to direct minimal scenes.",3
Didn't Patty confirm he's Maxwell Lord?,1
"Lol this part confused me. Not because of the twist but it seems like Batman walks into a cell and Eric/Joker slams the door and locks him in. Then he reveals himself and Batman turns around (away from the cell door) and there’s a speech bubble that says “Soooo, Bats” and the tail also seems to be coming from behind Batman but then it shows Joker on the other side of the bars again???",1

The UC does make a lot of changes:  https://youtu.be/IslGylvkjPE  The main criticism is that the stuff that was cut was actually important to the plot and the development of the characters. The end result is the film is much less confusing and much more complete,1
Tom hardy isn't middle eastern so it's still whitewashing,1
"Interesting! I wish he would elaborate a bit more on what that archival footage actually is.. so i take it that Leto will be shown in the film after all unless they change the final product, interested to see what they include.",1

Ah. a frequent response from someone who got their Batman history lesson from a YouTube video.  Study the history of Batman in comics. Read Batman #402. Read TDKR. Watch the live-action films and then come back to me and we’ll talk about Batman and his rule and killing.,0
Well watchmen was also a flop,1
The shot wasn't good to begin with.,1
"I have friends who were very upset about the casting. With Jared Leto, the worst has already happened. DC Cinematic Universe can't hurt me anymore.   I'm just happy they hired a good actress, I couldn't give less of a fuck about her race or politics.   At this point they could hire Tilda Swinton to play Bane and I would be on here saying give her a chance.   That's how shitty of an actor Jared Leto is.",1
Very true. & DC was (at least publicly) very happy for Marvel when Endgame broke the box office record. It's a bunch of people in the same industry appreciating each other's work.,1

"I think no one realizes that Ezra is the only one who got away from this mess with some success.  - He didn't have to deal with socia media rants as he dont have one. - Didnt have to talk about Snydet Cut like Jason Momoa did. - Already is starring in WB's Fantastic Beasts franchise. - Even though directors attached to Flash Movie left due to creative differences, Ezra decided to pitch a new plot to WB and now IT's director is on board and the movie is ready to roll soon.",2
"He's clearly adept at making crowd-pleasing blockbusters. He's taken 3 separate franchises which were on the downswing, and catapulted them back to mainstream and critic appeal. That's no easy feat, and to do it thrice is incredible.",3
I think l  she has the acting chops too. If you watch Big Little Lies she was able to act alongside acting juggernauts,3

"The big boy scout thing was okay for the 50s, 60s and 70s, back when the Comic Code Authority was basically Nixon-ing its way through artistic creation.  But today, especially for a 80-year-old character, it feels bland and unimaginative. Superheroes in our day and age are defined by more than just being the holier-than-thou icon, it needs some measure of depth. And this is even more true for the OG superhero.",3
"Funny enough, I can imagine the dynamic between Clark Kent and Teth-Adam being similar to Luke Hobbs and Dominic Toretto in the F&F franchise.  One's the straight arrow, stickler for the rules and won't stand for the shenanigans of this reckless renegade who does whatever he wants.  And even when they end up on better terms, they still rib each other.  ""I'll see you soon.""  ""...No, you won't.""",2

"Pretty sure it's not an ""adaptation"". It's an original story that's taking inspiration from a couple of things, most likely including TLH.",1
Is this surprising? I’ve never heard much positivity from Cavill towards BvS or any cut of JL. I don’t think he’s at all happy with what Snyder did with the character and most of what he’s spoken of wanting for the future is like the opposite of a Snyder movie.,3
They are not same continuity. Only first 2 are. 3. Burton movie was in development but it was scraped by WB. Catwoman would return in his movie.,0
But how do you know I kept refreshing the page? Looking dumb again. You continuously making yourself a hypocrite because clearly you need special attention. It’s easy to talk behind the internet isn’t it?,1
Closer to the release of HBO max I would imagine.,2
Why Marvel?,1
The cost of completing it would be a significant con. If they wanted to use Junkie XLs score there'd be issues with music licencing.  Another potential con that a lot of people don't like to consider is that Snyder's cut could be even more poorly received than the theatrical cut was.  BvS was a deeply unpopular movie and the studio taking over the movie from Snyder and then eventually replacing him was their attempt to move away from BvS. Releasing the Snyder cut might dredge up anti DCEU sentiment they are trying to move away from. Unfortunately this is why they might not be too enthusiastic about Cavill donning the suit again too.,3
It's not she hasn't been black in a couple versions of the character anyway though.,2
"So you think that in 2018, when the Snyder Cut wasn't that big of a deal, Henry, who had a horrible relationship with WB after that mess called Josstice League, would've made it worse by saying ""the better movie is in the cutting room floor, release it""? He was just being professional.",2

">Batman isn't exactly a reliable narrator in TDKR. He has whole fugue states where he doesn't know what he's been doing  As Bruce before he becomes batman again, it's used to show that he's lost and that batman is his true subconscious that wants to be free and take back the reins, to be his true self, but as Batman he's never shown to be unreliable outside of when he may or may not have killed Joker.  >The cops wouldn't necessarily have evidence Batman did it. Both thugs were killed with each others' guns.  The cops only need probable cause, which they definitely would have had. And even from the perspective to just demonise him, do you think they would have prioritised ""causing a public hazard"" over ""Suspected of murdering a teen""?",0
"I don't believe in Snyder's vision for the character.  I just like having some vision better than what we got in Justice League and Shazam, which are the most thoughtless action movies you could make.

That was abandoned before JL started filming AND even Snyder considered it too far on retrospect. Just look at the early Snyder JL trailers dude. They're pretty optimistic. But in a Patty Jenkins or Donner way. Not the Whedon/Lester way.,2

"Fully correct, just wanted to clarify what constitutes an acceptable score on Hans-Zimmer.com for anybody curious. Essentially, the site is dedicated to Remote Control Productions, Hans Zimmer's score company. Any composer in this company, and any score they compose, will be posted on Hans-Zimmer.com. RCP is a large organisation, and they're thus everywhere in Hollywod. The DCEU is therefore quite heavily represented here. So far, Suicide Squad (Steven Price), Birds of Prey (Daniel Pemberton), and The Batman (Michael Giacchino) will be / are the only DCEU scores left off of the site:   * Hans Zimmer - Man of Steel   * Hans Zimmer & Junkie XL - Batman v Superman   * Rupert Gregson-Williams - Wonder Woman   * Geoff Zanelli & T.J. Lindgren (Additional composers) - Justice League   * Rupert Gregson-Williams - Aquaman   * Benjamin Wallfisch - Shazam   * Hans Zimmer - Wonder Woman 1984  More specifically, the big part of this site is unreleased scores. Hybrid Soldier pieces together cues from performance rights organisations like ASCAP & GEMA and combines them with their sources to detail unreleased scores. [This is the complete tracklisting to Aquaman, for example](http://www.hans-zimmer.com/index.php?rub=disco&id=1709). It's how we learn what the unreleased scores are like before they actually release.",2

"Reposting something I wrote some times ago:   With Matt Reeves' *The Batman* moving full steam ahead, I'd like to share with you an idea for a Batman movie that I had back when the DCEU was still whole. The movie, titled **Batman - After Dark**, would have been the 3rd entry in the DCEU after *Man of Steel* and *Wonder Woman*. Basically, the plot takes place during 3 nights, each one set in a different stage of Batman's career as the Caped Crusader.   During the first night, a young Batman investigates a string of high profile burglaries which leads to his first encounter with Selina Kyle aka Catwoman. The second night sees a more experienced Batman, aided by his protege Robin, chasing down a sadistic serial killer (Victor Zsasz) in Gotham's sewers who is supposed to be responsible for the kidnapping and killing of a dozen of teenage girls. The third night is set in the present times, where a broken down, but still highly capable Batman is lured into a trap by Deathstroke, who has abducted Catwoman and uses her as bait.   The movie's opening sequence follows Batman as he tracks Deathstroke to a warehouse where Catwoman is supposed to be held captive. As he is about to free her, he realizes that she's not Selina at all and the entire building has been rigged to explode. Batman manages to escape, but is badly wounded. In the ensuing fight with Deathstroke, our hero takes a serious beating and is ultimately defeated. When he comes to, Batman finds himself strapped to a surgical chair (with his mask still on), facing Hugo Strange. Strange begins to torture Batman to extract information about a certain serial killer and his victims. As he refuses to talk, Strange injects Batman with a bunch of psychoactive drugs designed to unlock his memories, leading him to hallucinate.  What follows is Batman drifting back and forth between the first and second night. Selina Kyle, the kidnapped girls, they begin to merge together. We also see brief flashbacks of Martha Wayne. As the interrogation progresses, it is revealed that Hugo Strange's own daughter was one of the kidnapped girls. She was never found. Ever since then Strange has been holding a grudge against Batman. He blames him for failing to find her. In the flashback we learn that Batman indeed couldn't stop Zsasz from killing the girls. It was then that he realized there were some evils even he could not defeat.    Eventually, Batman manages to free himself from the chair and begins to fight his way out of Strange's laboratory which happens to be situated below Arkham Asylum. The final fight is, once again, between a heavily drugged and gadget-less Batman and Deathstroke. Only this time Batman ends up victorious after breaking both of Deathstroke's arms.  In the movie's closing scene we see a montage a la Nolan of the three Batmans emerging from his mission just as the dawn breaks (cue Hans Zimmer's soaring music). The movie ends on a close-up of Batman's facial expressions which are all the same: stoical determination.  After credit scene #1: In his darkened penthouse office, Lex Luthor intently watches video footage of Batman's fight against Deathstroke. Next to him, an impatient Hugo Strange raises his voice, ""You've got what you wanted. Now I want what you promised me."" Cut to Luthor and Strange walking down a long dark corridor. At the end he opens the door to a white, well-lit room. In it, a terrified Victor Zsasz is strapped down in a chair. Strange enters. Luthor closes the door and walks away.  After credit scene #2: Back in his office, Luthor realizes he's not alone. From the shadow a woman's voice is heard, ""You gave me your word you wouldn't hurt him."" Catwoman emerges. ""And I didn't. Strange did,"" Luthor says with a slight mocking voice. ""Why do you care? Your debt is paid. We are even."" Catwoman retreats back into the shadow, but stops briefly, ""I hope you know what you're doing, Luthor. You're playing with forces far beyond your control."" Luthor is about to retort when his phone gives off some sort of alarm. He takes a look at it, opens the door to his balcony and watches something in the distance. ""Oh, I know exactly what I'm doing,"" he mumbles to himself, then gets on the railings and jumps.  ----  Edit: My casting choices for this movie would have been as following:  Batman - Bradley Cooper  Catwoman - Kate Beckinsale OR Eva Green  Hugo Strange - Mads Mikkelsen OR Mahershala Ali   Victor Zsasz - Jackie Earle Haley   Robin - Aaron Taylor-Johnson  Deathstroke - Mark Dacascos  Lex Luthor - Timothy Olyphant",2
I definitely blame Joel Schumacher for that dumpster fire of a movie. The writer of the script was to blame as well. I don’t think you can put it on any of the actors in the movie. They have little control of things you mentioned.,2
I heard The Batman takes place in the 70's.,1
"If Henry Cavill was so on board with Snyder's vision, why hasn't he come out in support of the Snyder Cut? Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot both posted about it, yet he didn't.",3
"To my point of view that WB has already screwed the dc universe in every single way And by that i mean all the cinematic universes we have from CW to DCEU to THE TITAN VERSE, this is getting missed up day by day and they just want the money 😑",2
The 4 movies are literally considered to be a series and sequels to one another. Believe what you want to believe though.,2
Obsolete word for what? I don’t read comics but this panel needs an end.,3
I thought i was the only one who enjoyed it! I agree and it had some great fight scenes in it. It was actually a really good animated DC movie.,3
"Getting the same feeling, it sounds incredibly bloated.",1
What difference does it make to you what people enjoy?,3
That would be a nice idea,0
"Henry Cavill seems like not a team player. He has time to 'like' BossLogic's fanart of Superman vs Brainiac on instagram, but doesn't have time to show a bit of loyalty and support for the director who made his role happen. Ben Affleck has no skin in the game anymore, and he still showed support. Henry lost a lot of cool points for me. Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, and Ray Fisher have loyalty, and I respect and admire them the most.",0
That’s just sad,2
"Can't applaud enough, and that's exactly what I meant in my original comment.   Defining Superman by just being about ""happiness"" and ""hope"" is incredibly lazy, and in modern storytelling it's simply neither inspiring, nor interesting. At least not if you don't start by focusing on the *road* to those specific traits. In other words, focus on how he *became* a figure of hope, which means he has to start from a place where he's not that yet.  In other words exactly what Snyder was doing. He wasn't deconstructing Superman. He was *reconstructing* him.",2
"I mean, we’d all watch that.",1
"So what you’re saying is, it’s never going to happen.  I wonder if they at least discussed it yet :-P",1
I seriously can’t be the only one who has the gut feeling that Ezra is out,3
"I mean, they would all be great",2
"""The night Superman died, it went off like Christmas"" ... because Lex told Apokolips Earth had no defenders, likely, ergo the movie would show us another POV of the ending. I bet anything Lex witnessed Supes death or had a way of knowing.  I remember, the new 52 launched with Lex in cahoots with Brainiac. I was of the opinion opening night that Lex got an in with Apokolips, opened the door and wanted to be cushy in a cell away from the mess. In doing so, Lex orchestrates Supes death, triggers Batman's quest to find defenders and ultimately, breaks out of prison when his plan succeeded. He takes out multiple threats, earns catharsis, and is in zero fear of danger.  The only hitch? Batman sent him to Arkham, a broken down shithole, ergo in the Snyder Cut, Lex likely hired Deathstroke as payback; thus, the Batman v Deathstroke premise of Batfleck Solo... but the changing of Snyder's story as well as Batman's in SS and JL, meant there was no way to tie into Affleck's passion project. Affleck likely stepped down because he knew the build up to his Batman's greatest outing had its groundwork rewritten and reshot for the Legion of Doom.",3
I was of the impression it was never actually completed.,0
I wish this was in the movie,2
Amazing Spider-Man is a great example. Not so much TASM2 though.,1
"It turns it into a “franchise movie” , which doesn’t disqualify it but may make it seem less special. I think it mostly hurts screenplay and picture noms. I don’t think Phoenix’s performance can be over looked for a nomination at this point.",2
">Agree to disagree, then.  It's for the best man. To each his own.",0
"Dave Bautista's job as Drax with Disney was also at risk, but he didn't stop speaking out for James Gunn. That's what the real Superman would do. He would stick up for his friends, protect the ones he loves, etc.",1
It would’ve been extremely stupid to make a Black Adam movie that isn’t in the same universe as Shazam. Especially considering the Black Adam easter egg.,1
It’s a waste casting DDL as Thomas Wayne.,0
"Definitely agreed, the long time frame only makes the chance of discovery go up.",2
Gatekeeping of a certain image of characters has become a problem with many fandoms but DC and Star Wars have been affected the most imo.,3
"I didn’t say he wasn’t allowed to share what he wants. But it seems that he keeps sharing pics of a movie that already came out when he could be sharing pics of upcoming projects instead.   Look, I LOVE man of steel. But let’s be honest, zack’s record is not one to guarantee a better movie.",1
u/AngryJoeShow,1
"> I've exaggerated nothing   Sure you have, because I just stated why using facts and figures to illustrate it. The entire premise of your argument is flawed. If fans truly carry the franchises then that means nothing about Affleck's films having a negative impact on Pattinson's since, as I already stated, despite the claim that Ben is the most popular Batman ever, his movies made considerably less at the box office (not even counting poor reviews) than Keaton's first film or Bale's second and third.   Like I said, it's fine if you like Ben. I like him and feel he got a bum deal. But to pretend he's some sort of mega-popular portrayal that will kill the new Batman in its cradle because audiences won't accept anyone else in the role is an utter fantasy and not supported by the actual evidence we have on hand.",1
He was fired. Let’s not kid ourselves.,0
"I don't know if I'd agree with everything on your list.   But then I think its kinda rediculous to even consider them in the same sentence. I mean, the only similarity between all those films and MoS is that they're all comic book films.",0
"It doesn't matter because the SnYdEr CuT will not be released anytime soon if ever, and no amount of Twitter hashtags will change that.",1
Whew! Release the SnyderCut!,2
Big dick Todd,3
Especially since there both huge Batman fans!,3
"Only problem with a big actress playing lead is everyone is going to be pushed to the back and hardly any focus on them, this is going to be a Harley Quinn movie featuring birds of prey, which is cool as Margot Robbie is fantastic but be nice to see more variety.",2
"To be completely honest i haven’t ever thought that Zack is bigger than Chris,i am surprised.",1
Alexandra Daddario duh,2
"Couldn't agree more. Felt like a copy paste movie, and most of the dialogue is just exposition. Some great action and I like the CGI, but the writing and structure was fucking awful and unoriginal",0
"i do think its very possible with how much he talks about the noir tone and the whole ""point of view"" driven thing. And a lot of his favorite comics he mentioned have the inner monologues as well.",2
"The Snyder Cut yeah we don’t want too many characters bogging down the story people will get lost. So chop it down to 2 hours and remove Flash Cyborg and Aquaman story  The Batman movie yes every rogues gallery villain will appear without an origin including Calendar Man, Rat Man, And Fat Man.   Irony of the fan base and WB",0
I think it's more than just Cavill wanting to come back and WB being weird. Its possible that he wants more control over the movie. He had a take that the producer from Mission Impossible was interested in. Same boat as Ezra Miller,1
That's cool  I can respect a different opinion.,1
He could have but that would have diminished the narrative that he had established,1
Fuck yeah.  &#x200B;  I think Zack is going to go into overload mode now with Snyder Cut exclusives,3
The same way Wonder Woman 1984 is gonna have Diana fighting in public back in the 1980s based on what we know. They're not gonna be overly beholden to the continuity of the older films going forward.,2
There’s still hope!,3
Came here to say this.,1
"Tbh a potential MoS 2/Superman movie could realistically come out in 2023 at the earliest anyway. Before Superman there will be Shazam 2, New Gods, Flash and Joker 2 ( I'm sure it will happen after how big of a success it was and how Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix changes their tune after it broke out. I don't think it should be made but I am sure WB is trying theit damn hardest) for sure and potentially an Wonder Woman 3 and Gotham City Sirens. I can't see it before 2023 anyway",1
2 pics from the cut and one bts photo? Something is definitely happening.,3
"Have you seen Snyders photo Superman from Justice League which he released recently, which wasn't in the movie? That was how Superman was supposed to be in JL. He wanted Superman to become the comic version of Superman in Justice League, beacon of hope. Cavill's Superman just had a slower arc to get to the comic version, where normally, it would just take 1 movie, it took 3 movies for Cavill to get to be the comic version in the Snydercut of JL. That was the plan.   It makes so much sense too. An overpower demigod with a sense of morality will always question himself whether he should do what he should do. He does want to help, but he learns his role in the world through the 3 movies. At the end of BvS, he chooses again to just save the world because it is his home and will always do it no matter the criticisms. We have no idea what his original arc was gonna be in the SnyderCut of JL. Maybe he doesn't regain his memories and becomes the beacon of hope, but when Darkseid kills Lois, his mentality weakens a bit and Darksides uses the Antilife equation to make Superman his thrall, which becomes the Knightmare version of Superman.   After JL2, where Flash goes back in time and Batman saves Lois, we get the complete version of Superman, where is experienced and sure of himself. I think this makes Superman so much more interesting, that he is fallible instead of always making the correct decisions. Very interesting arc and growth in character.",1
The most important thing for me is that they show what would happen if superheroes really appeared in our world. I don't feel that with MCU movies - even though I like some of them.,2
"There’s always a lot more to know. If anything else, it’s a nice detail",0
I think from WBs point of view they've had two big swings at Superman and neither of them have really taken off like they'd hoped they would. So they might well be considering a fresh take with Vlad Zod or some other interesting variation.,2
Snyder is the best CBM director period and Man of Steel is the best Superman movie HANDSDOWN no comparison,1
"So if it’s successful, and well received, do we get the planned Justice League Part 2?   I don’t see how they can continue with Aquaman, WW, Harley with a whole different Batman",0
I rewatched it yesterday. Ultimate edition gives so much to the story.,3
Gimmie question and dat Blue beetle :D,1
Please tell me they're getting more comic-accurate costumes by the end of the movie.,3
"If things go the way I think they might, after Deadpool and Joker doing so well with heavy content, if a Snyder cut is released and does well, it might get the Bladerunner treatment and Snyder might be asked to finish his trilogy?  That would be nice.",0
"Vulko looks sick in this pic!. I'd eat my own hand if wan done that. But it's not his style, unless he's making a horror, so I know that'll never happen. Which is pretty shit for us.",3
Never thought of Rami Malek as Doctor fate,3
Henry recently liked Boss Logic's Superman pic the other day. He just didn't want to participate,3

“They both suck lol”  This reaction is exactly why WB should have just gone with the artists’ vision.,0
ZACK SNYDER HIMSELF COULD NOT BE MORE POSSIBLY FIRST HAND. HE'S THE ONE WHO LITERALLY MADE IT HIMSELF.  Good grief. You got me. I fell for your ridiculous trolling. Pat yourself on the back and go away.,0
he isn't. That was for Ben's movie. Not Matt. Matt is using Riddler and Penguin as the primary villains it would seem,3
"Weird, considering we saw Cillian Murphy and Eon Bailey in that suit as well and they both have massively different shapes than Bale.  Side note: They released Eon Bailey’s audition, which was awful, but not Jake Gyllenhaal’s?",1
He would have been a great choice for Riddler.  Scarecrow though would be a really interesting choice though,3
"boyscout =/= Reeves movies.         I recommend either the Superman comics post Infinite Crisis or the Rebirth era, where it shows how he can still be a boyscout and be interesting and modern",3
Not it's not a fact. You're just insulting me now and calling me dumb for things that I am factually talking about but now you're coming across as the bigger jerk here. My argument's arent in bad faith. That's just your assumption. They are in good faith. Stay bitter but do better.,1
Maybe the show will be about Kyle or Jessica and Simon. Keeping them a bit more earth bound with a smaller budget while the movie is focused on Hal and John being space cops?,3
"You’re ignoring Bruce’s whole mindset. Bruce ONLY cares about killing Superman. That’s it. He’s not listening AT ALL to what Superman is saying, he doesn’t CARE what Superman is saying. He’s so far down his rabbit hole of hate. Superman even mentions Lex before getting getting cut off by one of his traps. Hell, he CALLS HIM BRUCE yet that doesn’t faze Batman.  And then there’s the whole aspect about Superman’s MOTHER BEING IN DANGER and is on a TIME LIMIT. Superman doesn’t really have the luxury of patience, or really the capability of it. So he decides the faster way to get Batman to listen since the MULTIPLE attempts at talking didn’t work that he needs to basically knock some sense into him. To say look, this fight you want is pointless, and if I was here to kill you I would have done it already so just listen.",1
"Of course! But almost everyone who has a gripe with BvS says Batman should have gotten a movie first. Every time some new movie comes out, one hater will ask for a Batman movie. I'm glad this is being made.",2
"He voiced him on Justice League, so maybe that’s the basis?",0
Snyder is no Peter Jackson so that argument is invalid.,1
"I don't care if they're faithful to the original depiction, I've never read a single comic book. I just want good storytelling.   Joker isn't faithful to any comic. But it's good storytelling.  The MCU takes extensive liberties with their use of comic book characters and storylines. But it's good storytelling.  Matt Reeves is making lots of cool, unconventional casting choices for The Batman, actors who you wouldn't expect based on the comic book depiction. Good for him, I very much look forward to seeing what he does.  Zack Snyder's depictions of DC characters stray from their traditional depictions. That in and of itself is not an issue. But his stories are poorly conceived, poorly written, and aggressively focus on visual style over substance. That's bad storytelling.  So no, I don't dislike Zack Snyder because I'm gatekeeping. I dislike him because he failed to tell a good story, or a story I found interesting. And sorry, Jay, judging by the results, the majority of the audience agreed. So maybe don't complain about the audience abandoning a story they didn't like. Snyder could have done a better job convincing the majority to stick with him. He chose to stick to his guns, which is admirable in a way, but also meant he failed to see his vision through. It's the creator's job to convince the paying audience to like their vision. He didn't, so don't blame everyone for giving up on it.   Wish Snyder all the best in his future endeavors, but I'm glad he's gone.",0
Meh  that actor is 2 times better than Joe Manganiello. The man has zero range for a layered role like death stroke.,1
I don't hate alien 3. Thanks for clarifying.,1
So it looks like a dumpster fire because you don't know what it is?,0
Maybe Christmas,1
Woah Aquaman made more than Joker AND TDK!  King of the sea indeed.,3
This is the second best batmobile I've ever seen,1
TDK being so amazing helped boost TDKR,3
"Tbh I would just leave the DC-based stuff thats not connected to the DCEU as Warner Bros. material like they did with superhero/comicbook movies before, because giving them a separate label implies the movies are related, and that just becomes confusing when they are not... like Reeves' Batman has seemingly nothing to do with Joker or the DCEU other than the source material it's drawn from and some people are already confused by that.",2
Schumacher had no control by the end of production,1
Why’s it disgusting?,2
"I would certainly get HBO Max then when I haven’t yet been interested in getting it.  Still want a physical copy, though. The movement shouldn’t end until we get a physical copy.",3
Am I the only one who finds this a bit funny?,1
Thank you! I was torn between Bernthal and Frank Grillo.,1
"They are right now making a movie that will emancipate Harley from Joker. A lovestory is not gonna happen anytime soon.  Also, Im already sick of Harley and all the Promo for BoP looks pretty bad.",1
This is a silly comment.,2
> I'm gonna take the word of a guy who actually _worked on the fucking thing_ more than some random yahoo with a blog.  Say it louder for the people in the back.,3
We were agreeing with each other. Go away,2
"Law of diminishing returns in this scene. The Avengers assembling in New York for the first time is more iconic and impactful to me. This is cool, no doubt, but by this point it feels more like fan service than a great moment in movies. Thanos just stands there and lets everyone ride in and do their superhero poses which is pretty silly.",2
"""You will give the people of  Earth an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will  stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun, Henry.""",3
This implies you can’t be a Boy Scout and have depth. It’s a tougher but to crack because earnestness is less cool than edgy-ness but I think there is a writer/director who can do it.,2
I kinda hope not. I read it recently and didn't really care for it.,0
I believe thats 80 minutes of screen time as well. Seems like there was still more,3
"Eh, still a weird choice to make Jimmy Olsen a CIA agent, only to get killed so soon. Would have been cool to have him in a trio with Clark and Lois.",1
That’s pretty dope,2
"Quality is subjective, money isn’t   But if Batman is number 1 then DC will basically be at Marvel’s level",0
Maybe I’ve seen bad shop jobs because his face always sticks out of it weirdly. This is the best I’ve seen.,1
I was looking for this,1
It's also what he's publicly claimed,0
">I remember seeing bts photos during the shoot on Jason's and Gal's instagram, they had a blast. Fast forward a year later, most of their enthusiasm are gone.   Those two are probably in the best position though simply because both have the next films set due to the success of the first one. The rest are just gone. Either in limbo or officially.",1
Maybe on Disney +.,0
Not when Grace Randolph’s arch nemesis has been cast in like every movie since 2015.,0
"Homestly, I was kinda iffy about the whole race-swap thing but  looking at pictures of her I can totally see her as Catwoman",2
Cyborg uses it at the end of JL. It happens to end up matching Aquaman’s suit.,1
"I don’t know what to believe anymore. He has done some very different comments in the past few years. But, well, he’s a big Superman fan and I hope he comes back. Being a fan of Zack isn’t something we need to care about. All that matters now is for him to find a way back to wear the cape again.",3
I remember him saying Snyder did a good job with MoS. Did he give any other comments on his works?,2
Didn’t people say the same about Keaton?,2
"I think if asked, Bill may do it. I think he would do a pretty good job even it is an obvious choice. He plays creepy roles well. His brothers may also be a good pick too.",1
"If you want some more hot tea, this guy on twt says he worked on hot toys for a lot of designs that are not in the theatrical cut and he's somewhat forthcoming.  Edit: nvm he doesn't seem that reliable and I don't wanna push rumors in this social economy.",2
Trueeeee,2
*I love democracy*,3
Every big movie has reshoots,0
Hmm well the price may be a *little* different,1
So their own shared Shazam universe.  The title is blatantly fake news.,1
Michael B Jordan would be good as the side character that shouldn't say anything. I think he is so overrated.,0
Needed this too,3
"So, people are saying they cgi’d the goggles out for the theatrical cut. Can anyone refresh my memory on what scenes they did that?",1
Meanwhile why not make MOS 2 while we wait and farewell with mos 3,1
Dr. Fate will be a woman. Hawkman will be a black guy.  Calling it now,0
No way WB gives him an entire label. Even Todd says it himself. After making the same mistake with Snyder I doubt they will do it again,1
Yeah but he should know the actual potential so if there isn’t any he should stop provoking it.,1
">Sometimes i feel like i'm watching a high-budget, fan made power rangers movie  Yeah, they did go for the Marvel tone for this movie. I'm glad Shazam and Joker were different.",1
Please take your hating on Snyder anywhere else. Thanks.,2
"People who are born confident are quite often arseholes. I'd prefer him to be humble and grow into confidence. What's wrong with giving him an actual reason be ""your"" Superman.",1
"I’m in just cause of harleys hyenas, the fact they went through with them is enough for me",1
When was GL in the Cut?,1
Says who? I bet a movie like that will be better recieved by critics and fans than Snyder’s movies.,2
Can this movie still catch aquaman?,1
"You know, now I’m even surprised that they kept this credits scene, maybe because they weren’t expecting the film to flop and canceling the shared universe",2
Thank you so much! I would love to see one as well! Hopefully done by someone much better than me :P,2
[I like the Batmobile tires one.](https://external-preview.redd.it/3aYb89fP6s2-we3NH46Ifkgmiga9NV5wrzgWTL-T7l4.png?width=700&auto=webp&s=70842e608f5a2a373337863ca2d57123971c959a),3
Anything JJ would make with Superman now would likely be better than the Superman shit we’ve gotten for the last 6 years.,0
"Nope. You don’t have to approve of this suggestion, or even of casting a black/mixed Batgirl, but how you present your so called “opinions” matter.   And you presented yours in a disgusting way. So you’re being disgusting.",2
"Lol right?  SS is bad but I found it entertaining.  If BoP is in the same ballpark, I’ll take it.",1
Has she been found guilty yet or are people just assuming? I'm I'm the middle in till its confirmed.,3
Perfect minus the undies,2
"This is a bad idea, we don’t need a sequel for this movie ffs",1
There's like literally 80+ surveillance videos of the abuse.,1
"My favorite bale fight is the Tumbler explosion in the dark knight, and the joker one is good too.Batman Begins definitely has the worst action out of the trilogy and The Dark knight Rises had epic spectacle",0
Hulk beat up a cringey junkie with bad tattoos? Good for him,0
"Well that’s just like your opinion, man.",1
That guy who got hit in the head with a fucking crate. His skull must've imploded. Also the dude with the grenade (even if he actually did that to himself).,2
Wasn't that a spoiler back in 2016?,1
Imagine how beautiful this is in colors.,3
you keep using words like magic and gods lol. You should stop,1
"What is undeniable about the synder cut is that is was finished shooting,aside from reshoots.What is debatable is how finished was the film ( I believe very)",2
"I think the Superman script covered both I and II, if I’m not mistaken.",1
I feel like he's too pretty to be Jay LOL. I've always imagined Jay to look like an average joe,1
"I actually always really liked Whedon. I even think Age of Ultron is underrated. But i can only imagine his direction of JL went something like this:  So Ben, now you lie in the grass and you are like *(clears throat)*  ""Yeah uh, something's definitely bLeEdInG""  *(starts giggling furiously)*",3
"> The Variety article from today also has a quote about it not being even slightly likely.  ""from a reliable insider"", just a dude giving an opinion.  And also look to my other comment I sent you.  Don't see why you think I'm bashing some other publication.    I'm just saying that there is no bad sources but ANY big news groups are fantastic.  And again Mark is getting this info from this article from HIS own first hand evidence.  So I don't care what Variety's trusted insider said about it's likelyhood of being released.  Same thing they've been saying for years.",2
"That's what I meant. Since Matt Reeves will most likely give us an already established Batman, what I'm trying to say is Joker goes into hiding and disguises himself and becomes closer to Batman before revealing himself in future sequels.",2
But my thing is he still would've looked like that for Snyder's reshoots. He just didn't look the part of the character anymore.,1
Movie studios dont own people. Theres no reason Cavill cant tweet support for another movie.,1
"sorry, didnt want to be harsh or anything. have a good day",1
"I really love the more alien design, I have never been particularly fond of the comics/animated Steppenwolf who looks like a Hun soldier from Mulan.   The Sonic redesign cost 5 million dollars and that is basically for a cartoon character. Full redesign of a realistic live action character in a 3 1/2 hour film would likely be vastly more expensive. So I highly doubt it would happen, it seems that WB think its too expensive to finish the current VFX for Justice League, let alone funding any new work.   > No excuses about money. It's safe to assume the fans can fund it themselves. Snyder cut funded by fans, not WB.  Come on bro, be serious.",1
The second looks awesome. Phoenix's one too! Great art aniway,1
"Well being 'done with his role' means finished, there wasn't plans to be called back. Henry personally wouldn't have been 'under the impression'. He's not an idiot who's never done a blockbuster. He knows one way or the other.  WB are not going to straight out say, 'Yo, we fucked up', especially as they were spinning the 'it's only a little bit of reshoots and Paramount are being mean' story.",1
Different continuities should not be expected to follow others,1
So the system in place to gather critics’ rating doesn’t agree with the rating of your lord and savior and now you want to say the system is wrong...  And I should now take the word of someone who clearly is a fan of Snyder over the word of critics whose sole job is to watch movies (not just the one they like) with a critic eye. Oookay,1
He also said hed like to make a movie that drew on the comics and  where Superman was joyful and hopeful and protected people as well as being strong and a badass. The implication being that he hasn't gotten to do that yet.,0
">However, Jay says he believes he shot the mutant in the head too, but he just didn’t want to pursue it in his film.   In the book batman says he hasn't been able to cross his line and break his rule when he's referring to the mutant leader, after the hostage situation with the mutant, so he didn't kill them. You also have the fact that the police don't mention it once, you think they'd let batman off with shooting a teen in the head?",1
Non binary people are not a joke,2
"Yeah, that’s not even remotely correct.",1
No. Keep him away.    I'd say go with /u/GovSchwarzenegger.,1
"I figure that virtually all of the cast has some form of NDA. Maybe some of them have enough clout within the DCEU and WB to break it or mess with it, and others don't. Either way, it's still great to see so many fans asking for Snyder's vision of Justice League.",1
"Well, yeah. But with the release and success of Aquaman then I was sure it wasn’t just a fluke.",1
And we’ve already seen a massive step up in quality and have hope for the future again,1
I would have Jim Gordon having a vasectomy for opening scene.,0
"At least we get an in universe reboot with Flashpoint. I get not liking Snyder and I get hating Snyder's more toxic fans, but actively trying to shit on a guy and his fans when you supposedly don't care for either is kind of dumb",2
Laserdisc,2
"Well I, for one, hope he'll be back.....................................................",1
We already had these best possible actor to play him.  Unfortunately everything else on the movie was shit.,2
>That means DC won’t beat Marvel at the box office for 2021   That was never going to happen tbh..Spiderman 3 will easily cross 1 billion and Thor & Doctor strange will definitely Overperform as they are riding Endgame bump ..they might even cross 1 billion on the other hand from the dc side only batman has the chance to cross 1 billion,3
THIS close to perfection...,1
"The movie only needs one improvement: an acknowledgement of the destruction and death in Metropolis after Superman kills Zod. The family he saves thanks him in his time of grief and Superman then goes to work digging out as many people as he can from the rubble while commentators shift between welcoming his help and condemning his presence.  Other than that, the movie's perfect as it is. Wouldn't change a thing.",2
Why did joker not released in China?,1
I certainly wouldn't say that the armor was big and bulky. It looks pretty streamlined to me. Lightweight and with mobility for armor.,1
Where did they say they have no future plans other than a “source” saying that?  And the only reason they didn’t get Cavill for a 5 second cameo and the end of Shazam was because he was on the other side of the planet filming The Witcher,1
Women ever getting convicted for domestic abuse lmao,3
Doubt Hugo would do it.,1
"It's still an improvement. Remember, The Martha Line is the first part in Bruce setting out to redeem himself. Note how during the Warehouse fight, he's far less brutal and direct than he was earlier in the film. His only kills now are much more instinctual (like kicking the guy to stop the grenade) rather than needlessly reckless for the sake of efficiency.",1
We ain't stopping,2
"I always assumed he thought Bill Gates was Batman. ""Out the window."" Windows 10.",3
"Yeah, I actually didn't like the texture in MoS that much, but I loved the upgrade.",3
"""Knock, Knock""...",3
Could someone explain to a DC noob what the Justice Society is? Is it a proto Justice League?,2
There with ya.,1
greg berlanti is bad producer.,0
Seems like a crowded movie.,1
"Marvel target kids, the main demographic ends up being all ages between late teens to late 30s. Target means f a, there's pretty much nontarget audience. If you want to see a heist movie, people will go and watch.",1
"I mean, yeah, it is, but it's kind of a flop, which was my point.",1
"Jordan pitched something, they didn't exactly reach out to him.",1
"Well, heres the thing, seems like their mindset of movies is clearly backwards, so why not look forward to the snyder cut if that's the case? Maybe the best way forward is to look backwards.",2
"My dream has always been James Earl Jones or Ron Perlman as Darkseid.  But honestly, Jeff Bridges is a great choice too and one I’ll support!",1
"Scarlett Johansson /s  But actually maybe the girl from the new Charlie’s Angels. Not sure of her name. And if she wasn’t already in Black Panther, then Lupita.",2
Cool. My point was about people who claim to hate the TC but somehow love the UC tho.,1
"Ah yes, Batman: Assault on Arkham.",1
"Yeah, and I guess Return of the King was overstuffed too. Oh wait that movie is heavily acclaimed and nobody says that.",2
Has Todd Phillips said this was made up?   I should have looked at your name earlier....,1
Those are the same flaws Zack has with all his movies.   He wasn't gonna suddenly become a great filmmaker. All he can do well are visuals.,1
So IW is legit right? At the same level as Variety and THR?,1
“Negative Thoughts” in fancy cursive,3
"I wouldn't agree that it makes more sense for it to be than not, especially given you just admitted that it was most definitely damage control. If Reeves was approached by Warner Bros with them telling him it's unconnected to the DCEU, and according to Pattison, Affleck had been out for two years (from now, that is), I think it's safe to assume it isn't going to be in the DCEU and Affleck was never intended to be the Batman in his film.   Jason Momoa pretty much stated that there isn't going to be any cross-over between his version of Aquaman and Pattison's Batman because ""it's it's own thing"". It's not in the DCEU.",0
You didn't even read my comment. Shows how up your own ass you are about this. I'm done with this convo.,1
"Funny, have I said they need to cast A list actors?  Nevertheless, Chris Hemsworth had Star Trek, two other films and 192 episodes of *Home and Away* under his belt.   Chris Evans had a decade of films behind him, including CBMs such as two Fantastic Four films, Scott Pilgrim, and The Losers.   Neither are comparable to Porter and his 5 episodes in the last 7 years.",0
"I mean, I know the comics, so it shouldn't be too bad, right?",1
No they're part of what inspires Wonder Woman to not stay hidden and intercede. I get why it's in the film as opposed to after the credits.  BUT its placement in the film absolutely kills the flow. The scene should have happened *before* Bruce starts training.,1
It's like reshooting and rewriting more than two acts of the film. No wonder the film failed.,1
"I absolutely can see some stupid executives wanting that. You ever seen Schnepp's Superman documentary? Where studio execs basically didn't understand these characters at all and wanted Superman to not fly or wear capes? These executives don't read comics, they make dumb decisions in blasted out emails trying to sound smart. Hell, look at Amy Pascal's leaked emails for examples of how dimwitted executives can be.",1
So it was zacks idea to do the stupid bubbles,0
Allow me to add Javier Bardem to that list  Dude is an amazing chameleon and I have no doubts he'd play Darkseid with the gravitas and power he'd deserve.  Plus dude kinda looks like him,2
I want the discussion of the Snyder cut to be open to everyone just like any of the other movies. Even if I agree or disagree with them. Open conversation.,0
I could actually buy this   Especially since Steppenwolf was Ciaran (Like imagine them having a scene together),2
The Michael B Jordan idea is super dumb.,1
All of that was retconned in the current hawkman series. Hawkman was actually first from a race of aliens called the deathbringers. He gets reincarnated to redeem what he'd done. I forget what hawkgirls new story is tho,1
"Then why the fuck use Cass and not literally anyone else!? This isn't a visual thing like Babs being a red head, or having a comic accurate costume. This is one of Cassandra's defining character traits and so intertwined with with that means for her character. It's like they wanted a cameo/name drop so they can say theu have Cassandra and attract her fans and then completely ruin her.",3
"Photoshopped, if you go on his page, HBO Max didn't ""Like"" the post. Also WBP's Twitter account has always followed Zack. Followers are shown by the most recent and he's all the way down by Emma Watson. The most recent follows by them are pages for their upcoming movies like The Way Back, BOP, Richard Jewell etc.",0
"Maybe I’m dumb, but I’m not really understanding what he’s trying to say or how it’s a shot at WB/Whedon.",1
There's a significant amount of people who will swear he's god's gift to film making lol.,2
People arent going to flock to buy a super duper directors cut of a flop from 3 years ago.,3
"Regardless it could be a retcon. It doesn’t prove this is another universe.   If we were wandering around a real world look for clues it would be different. But since these are movies, and they’re created, and things shift and change, it doesn’t mean that ‘we know’ atm.  Do I think they’re connected? Probably not. But a single characters race doesn’t prove that.",1
Is Reeves getting a trilogy?,1
"Well! You're in luck sir! Here is Justice League! You will get plenty of cheesy dialogue, a happy Superman who wanted to stay dead and lifts up a whole building without it falling to pieces!   (Just to clarify, I don't hate Reeves Superman, and my previous comment is just to show that you can take anything out of context and make it look bad. I just find it ludicrous that we're moaning about a Superman struggling to find his place in a modern world and would rather see him smile in his situation. I'm not a long time reader of Superman but from the recent stuff I've read he's still nothing like what all these people are hammering on about. I think he's changed, like almost every superhero since the 70's but for some reason they won't allow Superman to change with them, it's fine if you have an idea version of Superman, it just doesn't make any other version wrong by default. I personally think we were gonna get a modern Superman in JL based on the 2 scenes that were cut. I appreciate MOS and BVS a lot for the darker (with glimmers of hope throughout) approach, but hopefully one day if we get the cut and another solo movie we can see a fully accepted Superman who fully embraces his role as a hero. That's my take on it anyway)",0
"If I remember correctly it was a front heavy earning on Rises.  Which means TDK did such a good job, people couldn’t wait to see the next one.",3
It might !,0
"You also can say he has to because doomsday keep building up energy and wonder woman or batman is not nearby. Superman is the only one near the spear  Dude i don make it up.we don see wonder woman for like 40 second or so after she is being blasted by doomsday. Then we only see her after superman declare to lois and grab the spear and fly forward. If this don count as incapacitated to you then i have nothing further to said as i have repeating this way too many times. Also wonder woman don have her shield when she is being blasted so far away   so what superman is lucky? he choose to risk his life as he is the only person near the spear and when he see he got opportunity to stab doomsday, he just go for it. simple as that.  You are nitpicking regarding about batman. when doomsday first unleash the shockwave, the scene first show batman taking cover before showing superman and wonder woman withstand the blast. so superman knows batman is fine. Im not interested to further talk about this since this is nitpicky and not relevant  I'm not interested to debate about crowd of people present. This is exactly what I want to avoid in talking about What shud have been",1
"Some are gonna look real smart, and some are gonna look real dumb when the dust settles. I’ll just be here eatin’ popcorn.",3
To me it's felt like years lol,2
"That’s Snyder for ya, getting lost in his own head is his speciality.",3
No way!? Lol! Did he say that?.,2
"Yeah, previz footage is just done to get a sense of what a scene should look like, it's like a blueprint for a movie.",1
He’s done it once he can do it again,1
"It's his approach to TFA that worries me. He played really, really safe here, and this isn't what I want from DC.",3
The casting is great. It's all the things they say and do that's terrible.,2
They are in a movie that you would very much enjoy. We call it the josstice league go watch it,3
"Nobody knows enough about the amber heard thing, man. Just fans of either sides spreading rumors and shit.  Right now I'm only concerned with what they're actually doing, and Amber is doing a lot of good charity work and I appreciate it.   That's all I care about.",1
"Really good video, makes me appreciate Phoenix's makeup even more",2
"He’ll need a new director though,",1
"A movie with villains like clayface or a more monstrous killer Crock would be great, I think this is a perfect time to have a less-grounded batman, go full on-comics",2
I can hear this picture. “You’re awful Murray”,1
The point is batman doesn't know he (lex) knows who is...,2
"I mean the stars really have no option other than to lie unless their contracts are torn up. If they speak out, odds are they get blacklisted and never cast in anything major ever again by any studio. Hollywood is a surprisingly small world.",1
"Not surprising at all. The movie was insanely profitable and dominated the BO. Any studio would be dumb not to at least attempt a sequel for such a hit. Sure, it was a planned one-off, but once the cash started rolling in those plans changed immediately. This isn’t WB being stupid, this is normal Hollywood operating procedure.",2
84 allegedly contradicts BVS so there's that,1
You don't want Hal Jordan. I know I definitely do,1
Man! Vandal Savage would be such a brilliant movie!! It has enormous potential.,1
"You do know that Thomas Wayne IS Flashpoint Batman, right?",0
and Smith with Elba and Affleck with Pattinson,0
Much love,1
"Seems a lot of people are missing the fact that Michael B Jordan’s production company is set up at WB and the article says nothing about him playing Superman. Maybe he pitched for himself to play the character, maybe he didn’t",2
"“I consider the consumption of meat morally questionable, do you have any vegetarian options?”",3
That phrase does not mean what you seem to think it means.,1
"No, no, no, no you got it wrong. I said that Marvel fans never let anyone shit on their movies and we as DC fans always complain and say movies will flop. I remember comments when Jaquin Phoneix Joker make up was revealed. People said movie will flop, that it will be terrible and at the end it was masterpiece. We only saw 3 minute trailer and if you don't like it's OK. Margot really tries and loves to play Harley even though Suicide squad floped. Just look how she enjoyed in Comic con and she still wants to play Harley. This is why I am giving this movie chance, I always respect determination and hard work. About comics I read them but only Batman, Injustice and Flash.",1
Good! It's time to rebuild!,1

"I'd probably only change Pa's death, I understand what they were trying to go for, that Pa would sacrifice himself so that Clark can decide to come out as Superman by himself, but I feel that it goes over most peoples head and it comes off as a bit ridiculous.   I feel the more traditional heart attack could have gotten this point across too, he could have raced him to hospital but at risk of revealing himself, and pa asks him not to.",1
Do JJ and Snyder know each other closely?,2
This is fucking it.,1
"""*I'll be safe if I stay hidden*"" lmao",3
"Honestly I think the issue with Martha is the way they decided to film it.  Like, in my opinion the idea is really good but the execution was pretty stupid.  It’s just brutal fighting, brutal fighting, Martha, ptsd flashback, Lois lane comes out of nowhere, and now we’re friends.  It’s such a pivotal moment in the movie and it happens so quickly and with so little context.  Imagine if you had to pee right after Batman descends into that lower floor before the Martha scene.  You could literally have been gone two minutes and if you asked me what you missed I would’ve said “Batman was about to kill Superman but Lois Lane told Batman Superman’s moms name is Martha.”  And I know Snyder tried to make it as clear as possible that his Batman was basically nuts with all the visions and stuff, but the audience just isn’t really familiar enough with that kind of Batman to just *do that*.  There would need to be context to that kind of descent.  It’s the same reason killing didn’t work for the audience.  No ones saying Batman can’t kill, but *why* is this Batman killing?  It would be like if they made a Red Son movie and just jumped right into Russian Superman while skipping all the backstory.  Yes, Superman has been Russian before, no one is disputing that, but why is *this* Superman Russian?",2
Good luck man. This sub had become a full blown Snyder echo chamber. Anything contrary to him is down voted to hell.,1
A man of good taste I see,1
You’re crazy.,2
They don’t call him joker but he’s definitely him - Jerome ends up with the stitched-on joker face  and everything. I’m not sure Harley ever even gets named but it’s clearly her and she’s a pretty interesting interpretation - iirc she can’t/doesn’t talk at all.,0

Bring him back and keep Snyder the ffff away from DC and I'll be happy,0
That could change especially if Margot as Harley continues to do well with audiences.,1
Cesar Romero wasn't.,1
">The moment you change a character too much to fit a certain quota, then you're no longer adapting that character.  Here's the thing though. If you keep telling yourself these decisions are purely about diversity quotas then you'll only ever see them in those terms. Have you in anyway considered that these changes of recurring characters like Gordon and potentially Superman are motivated by the need for variety and differentiation more than ""diversity pandering""? If you *truly* believe that Kravitz or Fishbourne's castings were motivated solely by diversity then you need to step back and bit and reassess your perspective.",1
Zack is angry lol...,3
"That's why I said she was ""seemingly"" involved. She was potentially meant to be one of Darkseid's crew, seen through the boomtube at the end when the league look up after Steppenwolf's head is cut off. But yeah, that's speculation.  I never said it was proof. That's also why I caveat my last comment with it being a ""rumor"". Just offering a basis for speculation.",1
"You're probably right, cold cold heart was the Batman Arkham DLC with the same story.",2
"Why blame Paramount? It's not their fault WB decided to change most of his shots in JL.   They told Henry they wouldn't need him (per Charles Roven) so they shouldn't be surprised if things aren't prioritised for them. If they'd said they may need him, he'd probably just have chosen some five o'clock shadow.  Edit: mispelled Roven. :o",3
"Was it though? I didn't find MoS a downer overall, no more than Superman I or Superman II Donner Cut at least. It's far less depressing than Singer's gloomy accident. Seriously, if any Superman movie put me in a bad mood, it was Superman Returns. Mainly because I feel so damn sorry for Richard. He just wanted to be a good father, and here his wife is constantly lying to him and being so distant.  Rant over.",1
Bad creative decision by Snyder and his reasoning is ridiculous considering what kind of movies he makes. James Wan made the right move.,3
Werner Herzog!!!,1

"The entire Atlantian part of the film was trimmed. Like Steppenwolf invading Themascyria, he would have invaded Atlantis the same way. The theatrical cut even has dead Parademons floating in the water, a remnant of this cut plot point, even though only Steppenwolf invades.  It shows why they were so defensive of the Mother Box, they had already warded off an invasion, one that caused the fisherman to get attacked and made Aquaman go to Atlantis in the first place.  Strange that Whedon reshot part of the scene so Aquaman would find the green slime, yet cut out the Parademon invasion that literally caused it.  A pre-viz even features Mera using her water absorbing technique on a BvS-era Steppenwolf model which would have contrasted with her using the ability to help in the Aquaman solo.",3
You guys are ironically demonstrating my point there. Maybe everything doesn't fit neatly on one side or another of these traditional tribal divides?,2

"> Shooting scripts are only around 100 pages usually.   Shooting scripts have an average of 1 page equaling 1 minute, with exceptions obviously.   So a shooting script being 80 pages long is pretty on point for any feature that's under 100 minutes long.  If a movie is 120 minutes long, its script is definitely over 100 pages.",3

"What would be a better way of doing it, though? There aren’t going to be books on the subject he can read since it happened a really long time ago. The alternative is to have a villain explain it, but then it would be a cheesy monologue. Maybe a dream sequence, but that was already done in BvS with the alternate future timeline.  I guess you could have a sequence at the beginning just for viewers, but it’s Batman, he’s going to want as much information from Diana as possible anyways.",2
Snyder is posting pre viz shots. Doesnt mean that those shots never were finished. Just means those are the images he has on hand.   And vfx being unfinished doesnt mean they need to edit the film whatsoever.   Like i said. The guys in charge of vfx said most was finished. Some shots werent. That henry shot was from the opening of the film. So likely finished.   The movie by mark hughes who works for a top publisher is said to be 90%+ complete.   Which may be 90% on what they initially wanted as a theatrical release.  2 hr 51 minutes. But still. No editing. Just vfx shots worked on,1
**WUHHMAN** POWER,1
"Whst are they even waiting for at this point? 70 mil more than covers the cost of what it would take to finish the cut and then some.  That is, if it’s not already done. I’m sure Zack would pay out of pocket if it meant we could see it.",2
Imagine wasting time out of your day to pop into threads about directors and films you don't like just to troll in the comment section simply because you're a salty little cunt.,1
Boom. Easy peasy.,1
"Definitely. There's probably a clause in his contract that says he cannot promote any other material when working on The Witcher. Plus, there's also the possibility that he is trying to keep a good relationship with Warner Bros, when he's the ""least"" safe person still apparently contracted by them. Or, maybe, he just doesn't want to? Each and all of these are valid.",3

Why want the alien to look human ffs.",0
"I loved how retro, but modern the DCEU ""S"" shield turned out to be. It's a nice callback to the 50's Superman while updating it to look cleaner and more ""alien"".   It's sleek and aesthetically pleasing - probably my favorite live action ""S"" shield to date.",3
So like 80%?,2
uhh nope,0
There was such much cut...I guess GL was in there to...ugh...,1
Yes but I'd also prefer one that leaned more into the fantastical comic-booky feeling of the comics rather than a more realistic take,1

This  was before Matt Reeves was even attached to do a Batman film. At a  certain point, it just became really fun because of the speculation.  There were talks along the way with DC about it. There were talks along  the way with Matt about it. But, the truth is, I never went in to go  discuss it. I never went on tape for it.

"> It wasn’t Atlantis. I spoke with Zack [Snyder, director of Justice League,] early on, and Zack mentioned that the location that Aquaman swims to in Justice League is an outpost. So when he told me that was his idea, I was like, 'Oh great, then I can actually have Arthur go to Atlantis for the first time.' That’s very important for me, because he can go into it and have a wide-eyed approach to Atlantis and be in awe of it. I think that’s very important from a storytelling standpoint because the audience gets to experience Atlantis for the first time along with the character.",2

"1. No. Steppenwolf was dead by the end of JL1. At the end of JL2 Darkseid would kill Lois and brainwash Supes. He would only stay that way for a small part of JL3.   2. JL was already hyped up as more optimistic before BvS released. BvS was always meant to be the *Empire* of the series. The dark complex leadim to the triumphant payoff. The night is always darkest before the dawn.   3. Johns is a great comic writer. But he thought Batman needed to be hopeful and optimistic? He signed off on ""I don't not like you""? Yeah, excuse me if I'm not head over heels. Especially after he let a trailer company edit Suicide Squad.   4. Did you see the UC or DC of Watchmen. Cause it sounds like you missed the point. Also, Watchmen wasn't just dark or edgy, it was cruel and cynical. Which isn't a facet of Snyder's other movies. BvS ends with Bruce regaining faith in humanity for Christ's sake. That's too dark for you?   5. He does like Superman, and we know Superman was going to become more optimistic because that's 70% of what was talked about with JL when Snyder was shooting it. Also ""character people know him to be""? Superman has been reinterpreted many times. Post-Crisis he was very morally conflicted and tried to avoid his destiny. DC characters aren't static,  change with the times. This Superman didn't grow up in the 50s with WW2 hero stories and the greatest generation. He grew up with terrorism, 9/11, political division. If people think Superman needs to be static to be the ""real Superman"" then they're the ones that don't get the character. Fir reference, someone who has actually helped write said characters: https://mobile.twitter.com/jayoliva1/status/1198045218336989186   6. Zack literally attested to wanting Supes to be Reborn more optimistic several times. Those are his words. You're the one ignoring what we've heard from interviews, statements, Cavill himself, everyone involved in JL.     Just because you don't like Snyder doesn't mean he doesn't get the characters. Of we gatekeeped to that degree ever before, we'd never have gotten Keaton Bats or Jenkins WW, or hell even Reeve Supes. The Donner Movie was considered far more serious and less campy than any portrayal of Supes at the time. Donner made a Superman that was flawed enough to turn back time for one person without consequence. Who gave up his powers to live like a human. That was considered a departure, and the George Reeves diehards screamed about that just like the internet fanboys scream about modern Supes. People didn't like Post-Crisis Supes at first either, but many of those stories are absolute classics now. James Cameron once called Snyder ""ahead of his time"". Watchmen used to be hated, now it's widely liked. Opinions are already changing on MoS and BvSUE. Before too long, you'll be the one people think ""doesn't understand the character"". Supes diehards lost their mind at Chris Reeve. Look at how people think of him now.",0

Look at the photo Zack shared on Father's day fool. The same scene was fully rendered by the time he left the project in may 2017. 5 months of full time vfx work is heaps,3
"It’s really more Superman.  From Batman’s POV, he represents the people that get hurt on the side.. the pain and anger that brews from collateral damage.   Lex represents effectively the haters and alien-phobic.  The media represented the philosophical question of who should be making the choice of who to save? America? Superman? The government? I love that piece about: “how do we tell a mother whose child could’ve been saved by Superman” (forgot exact quote)   The senate scenes represented the political POV of the consequences of taking action in our world dynamics. You can’t just intervene across borders as there can be consequences.   The shots of people being saved being thankful and in the end mourning, represents the people that have a lot of love and hope and are welcoming of him.  Lois represented the relationship struggles that heroes (like police officers of firemen) go through that isn’t really talked about much.   The scene with Jonathan when Clark questioned everything after the senate bombing, explains that all your choices have consequences. We can always try to do the right thing, but sometimes it ends up hurting people. But it’s still the right thing to do.   Martha understands the weight of responsibility that has been put to Clark because he has powers. Just like the age old “with great power comes from great responsibility” but to be honest she’s right: he doesn’t owe the world a thing. Very similar to Jonathan’s assessment, he has to make that choice for himself.  And finally, this is really Clark’s journey. MOS he understands where he comes from and accepts his powers. BVS he goes around being the hero his father wanted him to be. But as we all expected not everyone will be happy he’s doing what he’s doing. You do your job as a hero, but people still will hate you. Of course it’s human to question if it’s worth it all along. And that’s what I loved about Zacks vision. It’s a very human journey to find your path of who you want to be. And I think that to be a hero, you have to carry that burden and accept that burden.",1

Let's say 60 years. Longer than from 1938 to 1993. That's literal decades as well.     Clark has been a Christ metaphor since the Donner movie.

"Probably nothing comes next. It would be in Zack's best interest to move on so he doesn't get screwed again, and WB's best interest to move on since they have a bright future ahead that can respect Zack's work (e.g. Aquaman, WW) while also doing it's own thing.   Given the packed schedule, the earliest Zack could do a movie is 2024; a cartoon series or mini-series might be nice though.",3
"I agree. Overall, the Shazam! score is very underrated.",2
I don’t think I’ve ever started a movie bawling my eyes out. This would’ve definitely done it for me.,1
"I think if depends on how Birds of Prey ( and you can argue that that movie is connected to Batmam too in a way because of Harley - Joker and the Gotham setting) Wonder Woman and Suicide Squad and Black Adam do.   With the success of the Joker  ( sure it made a lot of money because it was a great movie but I if it didn't have the name Joker the most popular villain of all time it wouldn't have made half of it even with the same cast and crew . That's the sad reality)  , Shazam underperforming and  the emphasis on Batman reboot I feel like DC might get the message that they should lean again on Batman and his mythology .  Aquaman and Wonder Woman did amazing but if  Black Adam, Suicide Squad with a ton of new characters ( even tho Harley is there) don't deliever then I feel like DC will start to lean only on those three. Time will tell  I wonder what if happen with Green Lanters Corps New Gods and Shazam 2. That would be an interesting way to see.how much audience is there for movies outside Aquaman, Batman and Wonder Woman and Superman for the future ( amd Flash but he is fairly established)",1

This is one of the few fan arts of Pattinson in the cowl that actually looks good. Very nice.,2
"The reason they changed the shots is because they changed directors, both with different visions. It would have been even worse if they tried to keep the film exactly as it was planned.  &#x200B;  And Paramount refused to negotiate on it. They wouldn't let him shave. WB offered to do all the work to CGI it back on in Fallout, even pay for it, but they refused. Reshoots are inevitable in any movie, so even if Snyder didn't have to leave the movie, they would have had to reshoot scenes anyways. It wasn't WB's fault that his face was all fucked up.",0

There are some traditionally white characters that can’t/shouldn’t be changed, but most non-white characters and non-European ethnic groups have much more explicit ties to their backgrounds than guys such as Johnny Storm.   But example, Bane’s ethnicity is somewhat ambiguous, but he’s associated with Latino culture. So even if Latinos can be white, casting a non-Hispanic white person would still be a form of white-washing.   It’s a lot trickier with Latinos and Hispanics, for sure, as there is no strict ties to a specific race.",1

"I'l give it a go , i kinda like the movie and its style and there are a lot of good stuff there but the main problems for me are  :   Terrible pacing and narrative structure  Clark is a stale character and plotwise too  Bruce has no restrictions before fighting supes and then just decides to help him. That needed better setup.  Lois has a useless subplot investigation to find the bad guy when we already know who it is,and when she does find out it no longer has value   The scene-marking plot makes no sense  There is no mystery or big revelation regarding the actual plot. Everything pretty much happens as you would expect excluding one or two instances that were just shock value.  The martha scene although somewhat smart  was executed poorly on a lot of ends  The dream sequences add nothing to this movie and are there just for set-up and clogging up the pacing  Just before the final fight they stop to advertise the next movie (something more appropriate for a credit scene)  And some more",3

"I'm already doing that.   ""Go SeE jOkEr BrO, IT's So GoOd""  I'm not seeing that shit. I'm not giving WB another cent. I want the Snyder Cut. The only money i'll pay after that if they ever released it is a proper Man of Steel sequel and everything that lives in the spirit of Zack moving forward. Period.   I'll promote NOT to support WB until we get the movie. I'll make sure no one supports them. I think we need to do that once HBO Max rolls around. If within the next 4 months that the movie hasn't been announced, we need to take the movement forward and start demonizing the company to the max and fuck up their box office plans. Steer everyone away from WB and let them become poor.",0

At least until it comes out.  This is all speculation, of course.

And yet look at what they did with *Night of the Owls: First Snow*. Wether you like the comics or not (I'm still wondering where I stand on this one) it took an interesting spin on the Nora-Victor relationsip.",1

He’s a bit of an over actor in Black Panther and Creed but he’s ok overall. I’ll take him in a role but not that one. WB doesn’t even care about being progressive they are just thinking of doing it because they see $$$. Batman makes them a ton of money and you never hear a whisper of this type of change for him.,2
"I get bummed over people getting irritated about an interpretation of a character. Why does the movie version have to have the exact origin as the original comic? Snyder clearly likes the Frank Miller shit and I can’t fault him for that. It rocks. Surely you know as well as I do that character traits change, especially over 80 years. Why is it so difficult to picture the DCEU as an Elseworlds story? Doing something different with the characters such as mixing and matching traits that you enjoy but recognize might be controversial, is a bold move. It sadly didn’t pay off box-office-wise or critically, but I can say with confidence Zack made me give a shit about Superman for the first time in years. He made him human and brought legitimate struggle to him. It only makes sense that he tried the same with Batman! Just my opinion, of course :)",1
"I hope whoever is head of marketing for it would be savvy enough to call it “Justice League: The Snyder Cut”. The fans are the only reason it’d be getting released, and that’d be a cool little tip of the hat to them.",3

"Superman declare to lois he love her and then went on to take the spear is not him decides to risk his life??  ""Both the audience and Superman have seen her being able to withstand both Doomsdays eye lasers and one of his blasts.""  Dude we see wonder woman need to use bracelet and shield to block the blast. Sure we seen her survive the blast but unlike superman, she is down for a quite while when being hit by the blast.  ""Doesn't that, along with the fact that kryptonite severely weakens superman, make her the best candidate to take doomsday out?""  Read the tweet i posted. It is clear that wonder woman is not in the position to take the spear by the time superman flies around and it is clearly logical that superman need to take the advantage to stab him while doomsday is weaken by batman kryptonite grenade for momentarily. You don seriously think that is the good time for superman attempt to coordinate with wonder woman who are already busy with her own thing. Plus wonder woman is very close to doomsday so obviously superman make a logical choice to go after doomsday rather than wasting time.  ""How is she shown to be incapacitated?""  You see her got hit by blast and then down for a while. Does that not count to be incapacitated?  ""But we've already seen that WW and somehow Batman are able to survive his blasts. Maybe if there was someone actually in tangible danger then his choice would have felt more meaningful.""  I don really think this is really matter here since it is still the same. This is just another case you personally think what would have make it better which I learn not to indulge in you on this. Also did u seriously think batman will be lucky to be survive again that blast??",1

"I mean, just look at Affleck in the Josstice League.  Actually, don't watch it.  It's impossible to get through any of it without throwing up in your own mouth.  Rather, just trust me when I tell you that he looks like he's getting a root canal in his reshot ""Batman"" scenes.    It hurts more that the two biggest characters who got the worst of it were two of the greatest fictional heroes ever created.  Snyder's versions of Bats and Supes were provocative yes, but they were respectable in terms of their mythology and what they represent to a modern world.  Whedon's were cartoon jokes, even worse than the embarrassing Thor and Hulk in Endgame.    It's ridiculous folks.  That is all.",3
"> Your facts are inaccurate.  They are not. Everything I just stated is verifiable. Like I said, either fans don't carry the audience for these films, or BVS's underperformance at the box office suggests that ""the fans"" aren't all that crazy about Affleck's Batman being the bestest ever if it came in well below the Keaton and Bale versions in terms of ticket sales.  That's the whole problem here. You personally love BVS and Affleck's portrayal of Batman, which is fine, but you're massively exaggerating how invested in it the majority of the audience is.   As I said before: if the Batman could successfully continue despite much more popular and positively received entries eventually giving way to new actors, there's literally no reason to think that won't happen for a new Batman. Again, this is a fact that is verifiable by looking at the box office history of the franchise.",1
"Wait, so that means Zack shot everything he needed before Joss came on board? Thus Synder Cut is all directed by Zack?   Or is the understanding that Zack shot what he could, then Joss came on board to shoot what Zack planned for, THEN Joss added reshoots to change the movie? So in terms of Snyder Cut, it's Zack's plans but Joss directed a certain amount?",1
"[Or, y'know...](https://i.redd.it/p5hh91a08pm01.jpg)",3
I've been saying this since 2017. Henry Cavill grew a moustache and began work on another film. Affleck gained fat. Ezra was working on another film. These aren't the actions of people who believe they are coming back for reshoots. It's not hard. It literally makes less sense to believe there wasn't an alternate cut. He had more than enough time. The actors were clearly finished filming and in the past Snyder has had a quick turn around for filming.,3

"Yeah, remember how Snyder said Deathstroke's appearance was to set him up for the solo Batman movie after?",1
I mean wan mindset is pretty good I think. If it’s a big action blockbuster he will make a fun crowd pleasing movie that’s cheesy and has a lot of heart. If it’s horror or not a action blockbuster it will be more gritty and serious. I don’t personally mind that. I grew up on cheese anyway lol.,2
"Who ever took that pic must've thought he is taking badass pic, but nope",1

I don't like Snyder for multiple reasons but this sub looooooovvvesss him tho so I'm sure I'm in the minority.",0
"I just like General Zod's, BvS and JL concept Steppenwolf's and Doomsday's design (during the movie Doomsday was evolving to his spikey form). Ares design was generic, reminded me of MCU villains, Shazam's was eh, and Aquaman's was alright, pretty comic accurate tho.",0

Because you're assuming all those people are going to buy the movie just because they RT'd the hashtag. Currently Wonder Woman is the highest selling DCEU movie DVD/Blu-Ray wise and it only received 115M+ in sales since 2017. BvS has only made around 80M in sales and JL even less. WB profiting off TSC to the point where it would offset their losses from the theatrical cut is very slim.  Also all these numbers come from [https://www.the-numbers.com](https://www.the-numbers.com),3
"Lol, when did I admit that it was ""most definitely damage control""? I said it could be, but I would take the director's word over uninformed projections. It can be a hard reboot/retcon of Batman in the DCEU. If they do crossovers down the line such as Justice League and Gotham City Sirens, audiences will expect/want Battinson and Zoe's Catwoman to play their respective roles in those films. It can be as separate as Reeves wants and he can excercise great creative freedom over his Batman world while still taking place in the greater DCEU and giving WB the most options.",1

I have seen fans online starting to call for that arc to be completed, which is absurd.   The Snyder Cut if it is released will be a one off thing, and probably considered as an alternate timeline and effectively non canon. Which is more than enough for me, I just want to see it. That should be the end of it.   Most studios or businesses in general would NEVER spend millions more on a product that lost them tens of millions of dollars just to please a small number of hardcore fans. If it's released then WB deserve some serious credit for it.",1
"Justice League is one of the worst movies ever made, and had a massive budget. Sorry, but i'm just telling the truth.   It is so bad that even its own fans don't want to watch it anymore and are now reduced to praying for a recut.",1
Too bad it's not up to him :(,1
"This Variety article its probably the closer to the truth. Like it says,if a sequel really happens,it will take many years to be made. Because DC has a busy slate but also because they want to make sure it will be on the same level of quality.",1

Haha! I didn't know people ACTUALLY thought that was good.,2
"Yeah, cause George Lucas absolutely wasn't thinking about money when he made teddy-bears Ewoks or fuckin' Gungans. Twas all for the fans and the childrin, cleeeearly.",0
"1. THIS. Agree on Perry as well, Fishburne is perfect as him. It helps that he seems to really enjoy the role as well. 2. Totally agree. It was nice seeing a Superman movie where Clark is actually pushed beyond his limits. My entire love for the neck snap is that:    1. It shows Zod is suicidal at that point. He's tragic in that it's literally in his DNA to defend Krypton. With no Krypton to defend, he wants an honorable death.    2. Zod is stronger than Clark. In the end, Clark has to submit. Zod wins in the end, which ensures that Superman must train and become better. Not just to defend the world, but to make sure he never crosses that line again. 3. THIS. Kidder had a lot of good stuff in concept, but they never really gave her the chance to shine. Durance was great on her own, but the writers were really schizophrenic with how they wanted to write her in context of the show. Adams was the first actress that avoided the usual Lois traps. She wasn't a nutjob like they played Kidder as, nor was she just a damsel like Durance ended up being half the time. She was, well, a journalist. It was believable to me that this woman was a Pulitzer-winner. 4. Agree, and I'd specifically like to talk about how the Battle of Metropolis FEELS real. New York gets destroyed in The Avengers, but it's so obviously fake that it doesn't have any weight. The VFX in MoS are so convincing and have so much force to them that I think the GA got a bit shell-shocked with it. 5. Yes. 6. It still boggles my mind that people were okay with Clark throwing powerless Zod to his death in II with triumphant music in the background, but Clark being forced to kill a stronger Zod and feeling remorse is ""a betrayal of the character"". Same people that were okay with Keaton enjoying blowing people up and lost their minds at Ben killing to save Martha I guess.  Literally everything you said is 100% correct.",2
"> Artists and storytellers aren’t just robots, they’re people in need of support to.  *Especially* when some personal tragedy happens that requires someone else to come in and finish your work...and the end result is far removed from your original vision!  I mean...the man had *Darkseid* in the film...who the hell cuts THAT out?!",1
Pretty much that’s the only similarity lol. Steppenwolf in the comics is not exactly the most exciting villain and doesn’t have the most exciting design either so I guess they wanted to redesign him from the ground up that fits the hellish landscape of Apokolips and Darkseid’s design. I was fine with the final design besides the wonky CGI. I thought they managed to somewhat capture his comic design but still have a unique flair that shows he’s actually related to Darkseid.,1
"GOAT movies, no competition",3
"Yeah no argument here. Whedon is an accomplished film maker and show maker, and clearly did not *need* to take on the Justice League reshoots. Accepting the offer, especially with the circumstances, was a selfish move, imo. I'll defend him from a lot of the criticism that he gets for the final product, but will never defend him for accepting the job in the first place.",0
"No. Hes fine. Other stuff will confuse him cause  It is irrelevant.  If you watch this film with that baggage, you're watching it wrong.",1
Sure but you can't blame WB either. They did what they could in the situation.,1

Sometimes the best way to move forward is to reflect on the past.,1
You might remember from the [Joker post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/e0q08f/fanart_heres_my_doodle_of_the_onscreen_jokers_let/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) from yesterday.

OK This is weird. Mainly as Steven Price is David Ayers go to composer since Fury. Why would they bring JXL in? Either way the score was sidelined for the jukebox soundtrack they ultimately went for. So ultimately both Price and JXL Would’ve been screwed over either way.,3
"It will. If it has good word of mouth, it'll have strong repeat viewing (which is what ultimately chopped off BVS' legs). And given the director's critical track record, it'll likely be well received.",1

"Theatrical cut is a Batman film  Ultimate Edition is a Superman film  The entire Snyderverse films - MoS, BvS, SS, WW and JL is centered around superman.   MoS -  An alien living among us  BvS -  People reacting to his actions ( both +ve and -ve )  How doing good is viewed politically by a faction of people. People mistaking superman as a jesus figure.  (Powerful people like Lex and Bat feeling threatened by it) How his sacrifice brings good in Batman and WW.  SS - Govt. realizing that superman sacrificed himself to  save the world.  They're afraid if next superman might be evil and arranges a deadly task force to do the dirty job.   WW - The true nature of humanity in peril.  Diana realizing how all hope is lost in the world.  Decides to remain hidden till Superman comes back and changes her view on world.   JL -  World with no superman and no hope.  Heroes gathering to stop a common enemy.  Eventually realizes that the world needs superman and the HOPE that comes with him.  Rebirth of Superman.  He can either move on or join the fight.  Superman embraces the shining ray of light.. the hope that must dawn upon the world in the tough time.   HOPE is what DCEU's Superman brings Its not sudden.. But it arrives.",2
"Folks would rule against it being a bats movie cause bats never had a complete plan and killed, so, if batman doesn't say ""it was all as i planned"" at the end then its not batman, snyder would never give the fans that moment. Supes was legit in my mind. I still give it a 9/10",1
">He helped frame the Superman's death scene in BvS. They both agreed that Superman should die at the end of the movie  This is why neither Nolan nor Snyder was a good fit for Superman. ""Hey, you know what's a good idea? Killing off Superman in his SECOND film!""  Fuck, Nolan was also the guy who wanted Bruce Wayne to RETIRE at the end of TDKR. I'm beginning to think that Nolan just doesn't know any of these characters well.",0
Let's get Italian actors playing Italian characters.,1
"We do not know what's going to happen unless we see the film, but I think Shazam! is a good indication of how they will handle such things from now on. Honestly, if all this leads to great films and the introduction of many new heroes then I am ok with not keeping continuity.",1
Should have been released this image from the start lol,2
"Move on, Zach.  The rest of us have.",1
"Finally a respected publication actually putting out the truth. THR pissed me off with the stupid ""Fabled"" shit. I know we all know this, but a lot of people don't. They need to hear this.",3
Joker in the comics is also full of toxin that changed his DNA.  Arthur is just a random dude that wears clown make up and so happened to be called Joker a couple times.,1
She definitely wasn’t the first to report this.   There were rumours as far back as March that the JSA was in the movie.   http://thathashtagshow.com/2019/03/08/exclusive-new-black-adam-script-features-hakwman-atom-smasher-and-stargirl/,2

Nah I'd rather just have Man of Steel 2 in the DCEU And recast Affleck with Jon Hamm to maintain DCEU Batman continuity,1
"Not a black Clark Kent. Which is what they're doing.  Also may I remind people of the fact that we have a black Perry White, an Israeli Wonder Woman, and a Polynesian Aquaman who look next to nothing like their main character portraits.",0

"Well I'm breaking the fact that movie did in fact make a billion dollars and the fact that plenty of people saw it clearly, plenty of those were different types of fans, some new and old, and definitely ones that were fans of Snyder as Momoa was cast during Snyders run.",0
"Ray is like ""Please look at me and tell me I'm not a bad person for doing this"". Everyone looked away. Poor guy was probably told his career is on the line",3
And what are the odds that such an effort results in something similar to what we witnessed with their attempt to cover up a mustache?,2
"It think that you nailed to aspects, I believe the next dc black entry should be horror and yes they have to cast an absolute star as the lead.",2
"I don't understand the title of this post.  Fan-cast... so NOT cast at all, just some people on the internet,  now asking other people on the internet?  Whatever. I like him.",0
But the same people would bitch if it were a page for page adaptation saying why don't they gave any creativity. Each author does things different with each character and that's all the movies are too. I used to hate xmen because rogue was more jubilee than rogue but accepted that it was their own take and not just live action 90s cartoon that I loved. But some of the X-Men movies are definitely stinkers,1
"I really, really don't think he would have asked them to do that.  Everything I read about him says he is not the type of person who what put his friends in that position. Ben is still with WB, Gal is still WW they have no reason to start breaking rank now. All it does is draw attention. You talk about anonymous sources as if that is a legitimate way a multi billion dollar company would handle something like this. They don't have to attach an employee name to make a public announcement, if they snyder cut fans are as inconsequential as so many say then they have nothing to lose/fear in terms of p.r. and money. You bring up Affleck but he literally publicly announced he wasn't Batman anymore. It doesn't matter that there was gossip leading up to it, it's Hollywood, he literally addressed the issue and put it to bed. I'm not even as hopeful as some because I don't want to get let down again but them tweeting is not nothing and I highly doubt he asked them to do it. But I don't know he didn't anymore that you know he did. I am starting to believe that the movie is finished, and that it was far closer to completion than we were lead to believe. All you have to do is look at the timeline of events, plus with Momoa's recent comments about it's completion I'm starting to think if any vfx were left to edit they were minimal enough Zach was more than capable of handling it through his production company. And if that is the case there is absolutely no risk for them to release it on HBOmax. If anything it would be a huge draw and not just for snyder cut fans. One for people who are curious due to all the build up and the other would be comic book or JL fans because at the very least it's another live action JL movie. And what comic book/JL fan doesn't want that.",2

"Because it's a fucking copout that needs to go away. If WB has something they want the Snyder fans to know. It will be apparent. The only thing a ""source"" is good for is spinning a convenient narrative.",0
"Theatrical cut? Definitely not, but Snyder doesn't really make movies for that, he makes them for himself. His JL was 214 mins long, the TC probably would have been closer to 2 1/2 - 3 hrs, but that's pretty much just speculation on my part",2
On the closed captions it also reads faint heart beating or something like that,1
"> BvS was more frustrating for him as I'd imagine he felt a bit sidelined and was somewhat upset that Batman was kinda ""taking over"" the movie for him. And as much as I absolutely loved his arc in the film, I still lament that we didn't get to see more of classic Superman lore like his life at the Daily Planet, his romance with Lois and his Superman dealing with people on a more personalized level.  I feel like one of BvS big problems was that the hole movie was just ""This is how much cooler and better Batman is compared to Superman"". Ben Afflecks Batman stole the show too much for me. But that is probably because Zack Snyder seems to be much better at directing more ground level and gritty heroes like Rorschach and Batman.",2
Ask yourself the difference between birds of prey and all those movies you just listed,3
Throw the whole movie away. Why can’t they just give us what we want? Justice league was garbage.,1
"No, because as dope as this was people complained about the fights. I never in my days thought I'd read through so much bullshit criticism that Krytonian Super fights should be less super. I dunno what is wrong with people",3
I’m so fucking tired of all the hate this film is getting.   1) just because you’re not interested in the movie does not mean it’s gonna be bad.   2) None of you have even seen the movie.

Just a lil.,1
Order! Order!,2
"Yeah, why can't Superman just snap necks and be perpetually sad and angry?",2
I don’t know how I feel about this to be honest.,1
"If they could do it for Sonic, then I don't see why not. Zack was ostensibly able to get the VFX done for Steppenwolf and Uxas/Darkseid already, so I dunno if he would wanna change it.",1
"It’s not an S, it means Hope!",1
"This is a great point, especially since the last time we had an actual Joker-Batman interaction was 11 years ago now. WB can pump out as many Jokers as they want, but for obvious reasons, it’s not fully satisfying to me unless he’s a Batman villain, and it’s been too long since we’ve had that",3
Omg Ben’s squished face. They’re all so beautiful though!,3
"Are you really trying to say that because what YOU wanted to happen doesn’t make any sense in this story, it means Snyder doesn’t have the skill to do it? It sounds like you just want a Deus ex machina no matter how weird it would be and make it Snyder’s fault for not having it make sense.   Look, just because you dislike a story, does not mean it’s bad storytelling or that it doesn’t make sense.",2
"The painting appears to be so ambiguous. That’s really cool. Before Lex turns it upside down, Bruce, having fallen represents the Devils and Clark, having literally come from the skies represents the Angels. Not sure if this is all intentional but it sure is genius.",3

For real?,2
"Zod has to die. Protecting Krypton is in his Blood, and with that purpose gone he just wants to die. The only thing that can kill him is Clark. So he forces Clark to kill him. It's more justified that depowering Zod and throwing him to his death with triumphant music in the background. As well, why does the movie need to be more brightly lit? It's a New York archetype city. You ever been to New York? It's dusty, and looks pretty much like the Metropolis we got. As well, Superman is on the first day and you just want people to automatically have hope from him? This is a world that went through 9/11, of course that's not gonna happen.     Superman does literally everything he can here. He saves the world, he puts human lives before the last remnants of his civilization, he actually allows himself to be vulnerable with Lois. What, do you want him to ignore the world-ending threat to save a cat from a tree or something?",2
Agreed. They were spinning gold in their pre-flashpoint films,1
"A bit of an idiotic comment from Henry honestly. It doesn’t matter if it will change anything or not, financially. Most of all, WB owes it to the cast and crew that want their hard work to be released. I would be surprised if his opinions have remained the same because as far as I’m concerned Whedon’s JL was an embarrassing display for everyone involved, especially Henry.",1
"Oh my god yes, save for Michael ironside being available.",1
It’s crazy how that entire first quote is a complete lie. Everything made up and manipulated to make WB look like the good guy. WB didn’t give a shit about Zack. They saw his daughter as a way to kick him out and they did just that.,2
"Even if you play it in front of them, they will still deny it.",3
"Don’t worry. He’s mad because you simply shut his mouth with that photo.  Also, he’s not smart enough to realise that it isn’t just about saving a cat but about doings small things out of kindness.",2

"No. Good films can also pull from a variety of sources regardless of how inherently incompatible they may seem on the surface. Because the job isn't to combine the stories as is.

Some of the visuals (namely the new Black Panther suit) were also taken from the very recent run by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreeze. * [*Avengers: Infinity War*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar) is an adaptation of *The Thanos Quest* and [*The Infinity Gauntlet*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheInfinityGauntlet), but takes elements from [*Infinity*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Infinity) as well in order to make Thanos' plot tied more closely to Earth. It also has elements of [*Annihilation*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Annihilation) and [*Secret Invasion*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion). * [*Captain Marvel*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019) combines the title character's origin story with elements lifted from [The Kree/Skrull War](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKreeSkrullWar). * [*Avengers: Endgame*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame), like *Infinity War*, draws from *The Infinity Gauntlet*, but the [Time](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel) [Heist](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaper) which takes up much of the middle section has a similar premise to [*Avengers Forever*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersForever), with additional elements cribbed from [J. Michael Straczynski](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski)'s run on [*The Mighty Thor*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor), [*Fear Itself*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FearItself), [*The Ultimates*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates) volume 3, and Rick Remender's run on [*Captain America*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica).

Zack Snyder should just release the movie frame by frame as b&w stills. And then let fans color-grade it as a collaborative fan edit lol  \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
I prefer the versions on the left,2
Anybody got the sparknotes for both of those articles? Lol,1
Do you want us to clap and congratulate your hind sight? This is pointless and will never happen. Everything doesnt have to be the MCU.,2
Damn.. what a shot.  It's sad to think we may never get to see The Snyder Cut,1
"Sweet. I will now. I'll be honest.. never got into shazam character...was even reluctant to pick up an issue of shazam, but the movie won me over. I'm really anticipating to see black Adam on screen now :D",1
It’s just what they heard.,2
"I dont know how you got downvoted for this lol, but I agree. After watching Man of Steel and Man from UNCLE, I could tell Cavill could make it big.",1
By telling the same damn story but worse? Prequels at least had a great story to tell and were super imaginative even if the execution was flawed,2
But what have they committed to in this article? It barely talks about anything coming up in concrete terms. Plus the article specifically mentions how Hamada changed the fact they were rushing to try and make release dates that were selected years in advance.,3
"IHop...was way, way worse.  7 eleven...",2
"Mate, 'edgy'? Would be used as something unpopular. If you think superman saving a cat is popular, people will laugh at you. I'm unfortunately not a teenager anymore, and if I was I'd still like Zacks vision, because it has actual depth, without being blindsided with the most chessiest crap that belongs in the 50s. Please name me a recent series where superman does nothing but saves people from burning buildings and cats from trees?. If you people want that, go and watch your precious Reeves collection.",1
Yeah I remember when we just kept hearing “he’s polishing the script” every other month for three or two years. Thank God we’re here now.,2
à la TDK Returns,1
"You’re acting like Snyder fans would be oppressed by the creation of a Reddit post flair.  Snyder fans are not, and will never be, oppressed.",1
Chris Terrio is a freaking genius.,3
This is how you know itll never happen,1
"They wouldn’t. They didn’t reshoot it to get bonus money. The bonus money was for keeping the release date the same. So they limited the time for reshoots by keeping the release date in November just for money. They either should have given them more time, or just not have done the reshoots at all.",2
Get him a better writer thats all.,1
"Even Shang-Chi has a chance at a billion, seeing as it’s the first ever Asian superhero movie",2
Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh,1
"100% agreed. It's always been tiresome but now it's absurd. It's the DC film sub, not the Snyder sub. I mean, is it fucking necessary to make a thread every time someone likes a tweet?",2
I wonder how these guys fit in the same suit that (I assume) was form fitted to the original actor.,3
Truly a work of someone under the Anti-Life equation.  This movie needs justice.,1
"Yeah I agree. And I'm glad, because it was an unnecessary and constraining creative choice to make metas and superheros a relatively new occurrence.",1
In the 1989 movie toward the end he kicks the sword guy down a several hundred foot belltower shaft.,3
The problem is he can't act. We need someone who can pull of being and intelligent villain not just be huge,3
"I wouldn’t mind more obscure characters, but I think they should get their heavy hitters right first.  Wonder Woman and Aquaman have hit it big, now they’ve gotta get Bats, Supes and Flash in the limelight. Not to mention that we have a friggen New Gods movie in development.",3

Hopefully everything works out well and we manage to get a proper justice league film before 2023.,1

Plus he is already Doctor Sivana,2
"Most exciting part of the article for me is that Green Lantern Corps remains a priority and is still in production, with Johns set to ""deliver a script at the end of the year"". When the show was announced, some thought that meant the end of the movie. According to this, it's not.",3
Disagree with your first and third points. The GA probably doesn’t know or care about this possible release and have moved on from it. Also who’s to say it doesn’t double down on what Snyder did with BvS and turn people off again like that film. Correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t we already see a more improved version of Superman in JL than in previous films?,3
Awsome! Hope he loses the stache this time lol.,1
Joss was only brought because WB had to clean up Zack's mess. They lost faith in him after giving him many chances and frankly they are right.  Stupid ass Snyder and his edgelording got this franchise toppled down.,0
"Yeah but that's the reshoots. In the few snyder scenes we got he looks fine, his acting is still good. Although we didn't get to see much of his acting from the snyder cut, I think the majority of his talking scenes in JL are Whedon. I'm struggling to remember a snyder scene they left in with Affleck where he has much dialogue.",1
"This suit looks so cool, but I still had my doubts about Manganiello. Deathstroke isn't just a generic badass, and Manganiello isn't the best actor. With Aquaman and Jason Momoa, they kind of made it work by making him more comedic and different overall. Not saying his Slade would have sucked, I'm just not sure if he could portray him accurately without problems.",1
"What I meant by ""real life"" was if Batman were real and he were to drive a vehicle from our world, this would be it! It looks like a freakin' tank. It's bullet proof too. Same concept as the Tumbler.  I probably should have titled this ""is like"" instead of ""looks like"" lol.",0
Those wouldn't benefit from its own tag since they don’t have a dedicated “movement” behind them that organize mass tweeting.,2
"Mamoa looks like a white dude due being part Irish, German and Hawaiian.",1
Despite how awesome all the other cinematic iterations are of Joker. I really liked Leto's as well.,3
Yup. And by assumption that means only 40 mins approx of Zacks footage was used in the final film.,3
"The article isn’t clear about who wrote those pages, is it Whedon or Warner Bros (Geoff Johns, etc...) ?",3
This one is more scarier than the one shown in JL..,1
I hope battinson's outfit is the long halloween/hush one but with the trunks replaced with an empty non-armored area with a bluish bodysuit.  He DID have a conversation with Christian Bale about the most important part being able to comfortably go to the bathroom.,2
"Henry Cavill's Superman is serious, introverted, and occasionally depressed.  But he's not DARK. He saves people all the time just because he can, and chooses to be a costumed hero even after Zod offers him a place with a New Krypton (at the cost of Earth getting destroyed).",3
Fucking tell it Jay!,3
"That is exactly what the tweet says, but based on the article, saying he walked away *WITH* vs *from* one or two is more accurate.",1
"If you’re speaking subjectively, then sure that’s like, your opinion man. But if you’re speaking objectively then I gotta tell you you’re wrong lol there’s other CBM directors and films that are better than Snyder and MoS",1
You didn't even see Snyders Superman in JL. Wtf?,2
"He’s starring in Snyder’s upcoming Netflix film.  Bautista seems like a pretty good guy.  I know this sub is hit or miss on following marvel news so in case you or someone reading this wasn’t aware, Bautista was very vocal in support of James Gunn when Disney fired him over those stupid tweets.  He straight up said he wouldn’t return to the role if Gunn isn’t directing.  So with that said, it wouldn’t shock me at all if the two of them bro’d out while working together no different than Momoa and Snyder did and he eventually got to see his cut.",1
"See there you go. You just proved your stubbornness. You just said my opinion is wrong. That is illogical and inaccurate. My opinion is not wrong because it is my opinion. Which I am entitled to become it is my right as a human being and a American. You can't be my thought police, only I can do that to myself.  My murder analogy is not at all the same as saying the Earth is flat. I'm pointing out the fact that if I understand the murderers motives and why he went and decided to murder people that does not mean I have to accept and agree with it. It just means that. Apply it to the same thing you're telling me to do with representation in media and it works the exact same way. I understand why it works and why people want representation in the psychological effects that the media have a pop filter have a people. I just don't agree with it because I don't think it actually is creating a healthier environment is creating more frustration in people.  I understand how the media changes how people I'm just pointing out a flaw and trying to force people into thinking a different way and how the media does that. When in actuality what they're trying to do its force people to think a certain way and in your own mind away when I actually think it really truly doesn't make a difference. At the end of the day you just have to accept who you are and no amount of media intervention or political messages in Media can force you or should force you to change the way you are or accept something different about yourself more except something and maybe you don't agree with. Only you can accept who you are.  Stop using other research line. I've done plenty of research I know all this stuff and I probably know more than you because I've probably been around a lot longer than you have. So get over yourself you're not that smart.",1
"Snyder could have easily disowned the film if he wanted to. But he had been kind and merciful to WB even after they fired him and shamelessly used his personal tragedy for their own narrative to hire Whedon. Snyder is still hopeful that WB releases his cut, but the higher-ups running the studio are absolute idiots. They didn't even agree to Todd Philips take on Joker at first, tried to allot less budget so that he quits, and co-produced the film which had a minuscule budget because scared of losses. They are absolute idiots.",3
"Glad you're enjoying AEW. For me it's been massively disappointing. The product doesn't feel unique or fresh, as they led us to believe it would be. I find that NXT is better on a week to week basis. Also, the AEW PPVs haven't been as good as NXT Takeovers usually are. Just my opinion tho.",1
"Even with this, there’s no guarantee that we’ll get it.   I was thinking yesterday about how The Fantastic Four is revered with Marvel Comics stories as The First Family. No where was this more obvious than when Johnny Storm “died” during Hickman’s run.  I was thinking about how the Superman character alone deserves a certain level of reverence for what he represents both in-comic and what he represents as a character, for us.  The Trinity should be treated as royalty. It’s so messed up that WB us treating them like D-list characters so something.  I mean, how dumb do you have to be  to mess this up.  It’s almost disgusting that a JL movie in which The Trinity are starring has to be drugged through the mud for so long.  This is despicable.",3
"At the very least it looks like we get another action piece at star labs, one in Diana telling history and a better fight sequence at the end against steppenwolf. We get characters more consistent with the tone/set up of the previous films. We get a longer run time that hopefully fleshes Barry and Victor's characters a little more and should in theory help with pacing. We also get the first look at Uxas/Darkseid on the big screen. Now whether you ultimately end up agreeing with his characterizations and like the plot and whatnot are up to you, I think on paper at least it makes for a better movie overall",2
Yeah he literally played one  That being said neither really give that vibe off to me,1
"Not latino, but great actor",1
"I love it. I also love the other ones you mentioned. This never occured to me before seeing your post but DCEU's Superman is more scifi, which makes sense for man of steel since it's a grounded scifi ""first encounter"" movie type approach to Superman.",1
Nope. Facts be facts. And we shall! Fun!,1
You dont know that I dont have any evidence. You're just assuming that. I've been debating you this entire time.,1
Exactly what you said. On one hand we know for a fact that it was supposed to be a tight 5 movie arc and not go on like mcu. On top of it we know what the basic story of those movies was gonna be.  There's literally no place I see him being HIM in Zack's DCEU (as long as he was in charge at least).,1
Deathstroke movie (in vain of Heat/Collateral),1
"IMO, Cavill has hinted a few times he isn’t happy with Synders vision of his character. Shame!",1
"""The bees.. ! No, wait. What was the line again? Oh yeah.. Oh no, the kryptonite! Not the kryptonite!""",1
"This movie is killing all the fancasts, and this is frickin awesome!",2
Campea or Oliva?,2
"This is a fucking, scalene triangle, 3D pixelated, PS1(X) graphics, minority report looking, moon rover azz cluster fuck.....  Shut up and take my money!!!!.",1
I think that would be even more confusing than calling it the Director's Cut,3
"Again, nothing for me to disagree with there.  Ben Affleck was a really interesting choice and I think he worked well with what we've seen of him as a veteran Batman and Bruce Wayne.   I'd really like to see a solo movie with Affleck as Batman, but that's not going to happen.",1
"I disagree,  but that doesn't mean I'm right. I loved Snyder's vision, and I really want the Snyder Cut. But I don't expect them to finish his vision, wouldn't be upset if they don't. I would hope most people understand they are going in a different direction.",2
And its the fucking opening scene. Way to set the mood.,3
I think what he's getting at is the fact that the fans are the ones that do watch these movies in a fan interest is being shown for one product and not the other that's something that needs to be addressed or at least look that because at the end of the day you want to make sure you guarantee a certain group of people to go and see your movie cuz otherwise if you can't even get the demographic of people that are most likely to watch a film then you're screwed.,0
"Imo, it’s worse than what we got. Steppenwolf should have been practical with CGI enhancements.   Something like [this ](https://www.instagram.com/p/BikoQ_TngTQ/?igshid=graskelwvfhw) is what they should have done. Similar to General Zod with a Armoured suit but not a full CGI replacement. A lot of people forget that in MoS General Zod’s suit was CGI.",3
"Nah, it's like the ending of Sense8 when Wolfgang says ""You don't understand, this is my city, and I bow to no one."" He's the resident guardian, you know, this is his tribe, his people. That's his world, in an abstract way, that he defends in a physical way.",1
Releasing a Snyder cut will only remind people of that trainwreck and jeopardize the good graces they are enjoying now. They are clearly moving on.,1
"If there were an overabundance of Pattinson threads, that were also repetitive and were not being removed in a timely manner, then yes there should be a filter. Same for any other topic that fits that description.",2
"Back when they were shooting BvS, people were convinced a guy named Dan Amboyer was playing Hal, based on a pic of him wearing a jacket on set that **resembled** (wasn’t one, it was his own personal jacket) a pilot’s jacket. His actual role was basically as a glorified extra.   I wasn’t really buying his cockiness, and I’d argue that Hal is straight up arrogant at times, not just cocky. Can’t see Alden making that work.",2
"Which is funny, since the buzz on TROS and reshoots is about 100x more negative than what happened with JL.    The current rumor is they’re STILL reshooting, re-editing, and trying to slap together the 3rd Act of Ep IX...and the film comes out in about 32 days. Heard the budget is up to around $500 million due to the multiple rounds of reshoots.",2
He’s so icy,1
"Yes. And I'm not a conspiracy theory guy, but I think the whole ""Batgirl movie"" was cover up for bringing in Whedon to do reshoots of JL in the first place. So they are telling us that Joss Whedon, the guy who created Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, wrote and directed the first two Avengers movies ""couldn't come up with a story"" for Batgirl????",2
"Man, I hate him",0
Really cool that the King is at the top.,3
"A monster movie like Jaws and Creature of the black lagoon. It could be very Lovecraft inspired. Maybe the main characters are townspeople, fisherman, or Atlantean teens.",1
"They should "" Deadpool "" the SC alternate opening  In other words.... "" leak "" it ^unless^it's^already^on^it's^way",1
No one but Zack Snyder and some of his close friends have seen Justice League.,2
Release the Snyder cut!!!!!!!!!!,2
"Really proud of everyone who joined the fight. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut   Personally, it was extremely inspiring and fulfilling to see that tremendous burst of positive energy and support.",3
"Idk man, I think this a publicity stunt that was planned to gain some traction for a cut release",1
Excited for Pattinson but will always be sad at the potential of what could have been.,3
It definitely can. Gal and Jason are not pressure points at all. It’s not like they are refusing to work with WB or something. A simple hashtag from Gal isn’t going to pressure WB into anything.,2
The ship? Snyder confirmed it was a GL ship in the link.   Yes. It could be. I was think Hal was already GL and came back when all this was going down.,1
"'has alot of heart' when people revert to using that phrase, it tends to be a shite film that is as you say made for all ages... But kids really. An adult can watch anything, kids can't.",0
Aquaman was not r rated.,1
"It’s balanced when you watch the UE, although the R rating is definitely that way because of Batman and Bats alone.   Also why I wouldn’t mind R rated Batman films going forward, but it’ll never happen.",2
Alright let's go baby Joker bring some awards home.,3
"Yeah Esai's mask is the only thing I don't like much about the Titans Deathstroke, but besides that his suit is gorgeous.",3
"Yeah, I get so annoyed that people don't understand this.  He had never trained. This was not a Superman that had spent his life honing and training his powers - this was a Superman that had been constantly over-protected by his father who had feared him being taken away or weaponised.  And on his first ever time trying to do something bigger than just saving people in his immediate vicinity (like those oilrig workers or his classmates in the schoolbus), of **course** he doesn't know stuff like how to avoid collateral damage or how to fight people on his level. And he snapped Zod's neck, but this was someone who had explicitly told him in no uncertain terms that he would never stop coming for Kal-El and killing humans. And look at the pain he felt after having to take a life.  The only single potential criticism that I think has a fair basis is his smiling and kissing Lois in the aftermath of all that death, but even that is due to the fact that he's effectively human.  I'm pretty sure that after the amount of death and suffering and utter abject terror that I and everyone else had been through, I'd want to find comfort in the arms of someone who loves me deeply, who I'm happy is alive.  Besides, they address this all in BvS where he's clearly depressed, before he will eventually learn to find hope through the League and the realisation that (professionally) he's not alone.",3
"Goodness, I remember when I used to trust the media this much.",1
Oh god just stop with this,0
"That reply says more about you than you’d think, lol.",3
From the current rumors ut looks like the JSA(which includes hawkman) and dr fate,1
"I'd have had Dylan Sprayberry in the scene where Jonathan died. I'd leave the rest alone, but that's the one thing I'd change.",1
-Bane.  -The Riddler.  -Orm/Ocean Master.  -Ra's Al Ghul.  -Cheetah.  -Lex Luthor.  -Sinestro.  -Star Sapphire.  -Etc.  There's plenty of DC villains that could potentially make for good films with the right director and vision.,3
You can say without a doubt people like shows like 'fleabag' more than previous comedic eras?,1
We trending. Over 1.1 million tweets with the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut hashtag last week.,3
Snyder said the opposite. The BvS design of the Steppenwulf was not supposed to be used in his version.     [https://heroichollywood.com/steppenwolf-justice-league-zack-snyder/](https://heroichollywood.com/steppenwolf-justice-league-zack-snyder/)    Previsualization often uses early designs on character models.,1
I feel people are thinking too small with DC Black  There is such untapped potential there and just having it be villain themed solo films is wasting that,3
I was the same as you. I absolutely hated this movie after seeing the theatrical cut but the Ultimate edition is very good.   I would say whether or not the UC is worth watching depends on why you didn’t like it in the first place.   If like me you didn’t enjoy the theatrical cut because it made no sense and the story was poor the ultimate cut fills in all the gaps and makes for a great story imo. The characters are no longer shallow and non sensical but have deep motivations for why they’re all doing the things they do.   If you didn’t like the tone or the style of the movie then the ultimate cut does nothing for that and I don’t think it’s worth watching if that’s the case.,3
...NPR ain't all that my friend.,1
"Yea, they translated it super well from the comics while also kinda making it look like Returns Superman (It is the same Superman)",1
"I doubt he was happy with this, and he was pushed to this direction by Geoff Johns and KT. Everyone else who was apart of that Warner Bros. team no longer works there.",1
Slightly better (miraculously) Although we all know how it would turned out in the end (crappy CGI),1
***ALL OF THIS IS RESHOOTS BY WHEDON WHICH IS NOT IN SNYDER'S CUT***  \- superman with kid's cellphone   \- superman revive and flew over kryptonian ship  \- do you believe scene  \- itchy scene at farm  \- superman met batman again and batman turned into tsundere  \- superman talking to flash about taking right and he talking left  \- superman saving apartment full with russian  \- superman used froze breath to steppenwolf axe  &#x200B;  ***THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SUPERMAN IN SNYDER'S CUT***  \- Superman felt he being stab again and again before revive  \- Superman turned rogue and fight league after steppenwolf use motherbox or so i read the rumors from test screening  \- clark kent propose to lois lane like in the trailer after he revive  \- superman inside kryptonian ship \*deleted scene that release for bluray special  \- superman second flight  \- superman came and beating steppenwolf similar to theater's cut but this time superman combo with aquaman and wonder woman chop steppenwolf head,1

Lex. We don’t know the exact details lex had promised to him,0
DO SCARECROW!!!,1
"Oh for sure, I agree, it would be depressing not to ever have the second part, but that would be mitigated by wiping away the Whedon mess forever (in my mind anyway).",2
"I think it's really cool that Ben supported it anyway and Gal, especially,  even posting a shot from the film. They have a huge following online and a lot of sway.",3
"Yeah, this is such a huge vindication for Zack.  I'm of the opinion that I'm going to very much like the Director Cut of JL, but even if some absolutely hate it, at least it would be Zack's product. He's spent 2 years, after the suicide of one of his kids, being blamed by the general audience for a movie that he had very little hand in, in the end.",3
Nah i hear it opens like BvS. A perspective from the end of the film before it.,3
"He was extremely annoying in the Transformers movies, but he's actually a great actor and could really pull this off.",0
Doctor Strange was created in 1963 and Doctor Fate in 1940 so kind of the other way around.,1
Carrie Anne Moss one of the best Trinities.   Meh on the Disney trinity there...,0
Step 3: go back in time to ensure BvS was well-liked and didn't collapse at the box office.,3
Aquaman was great because it embraced the weirdness   Also didn't Supes lift a rocket in BVS exactly like how he holds the building in JL  or that time he shifts a tectonic plate offscreen?  Exactly   The bubbles were dumb as hell regardless,2
">I mean. We dont know the context zack filmed this in.   This scene? Sure, but I was referring to the scene with him and Mera after steppenwolf took the atlantean mother box, it just makes the scene look awkward and clunky, Mera had to make a giant bubble just so they could talk.   >Doesnt look very good as well as being clunky.   I really doubt this scene would have looked all that different in the TC anyway.",1
I would love to see John Henry Irons show up on the big screen. I have loved the character since the Reign of the Supermen and he has not been given enough spotlight. Jordan would kill at it and it would be really cool to see Superman through the eyes of a person he inspired to take up the S and be a hero.,1
"Lol...you people really bend over backwards to hate Whedon.   Do you people have concept of how this works? What, you think WB hired Whedon and he just hijacked the production and fucked around doing whatever and WB just stood there?  No, that's not how it works. WB signed off on every fucking thing Whedon did.    The dude was hired by WB to do a job. He did the job THEY WANTED HIM TO DO. What is so hard to understand about that?",3
"All valid points but again, Snyder was building to that Superman, hence why his suit got lighter with every movie. If Clark were to come out the womb with the traditional Superman mindset then it wouldn’t make for a very good arc. Imo his arc really paid off too. Even though I hated JL it was awesome to finally see that confident Superman. You can’t have those highs unless you have those lows I guess.",2
"1. Clark is traveling for like 2 minutes of the movie searching for signs of his past. That's not really a brooding existential crisis.   2. His father didn't say he should've let them die. His father said ""Maybe"" after hesitating because like a real father who is trying to balance protecting his kid and instilling morals in him, he doesn't know the right answer. That's not dark or brooding. That's human.   3. The color scheme wasn't muted. It's no darker than most MCU movies. If anything I liked how it actually had a realistic shading to everything. Clark's suit has been a darker blue in most comics since Bryne's era, I'm not sure why people are only mow complaining that it needs to be more colorful.   4. It's his first day on the job and you're expecting a world that went through 9/11 to be filled with hope at the first sight of an alien?   5. Superman hasn't always had that attitude. Bryne's MoS series had a morally complex Clark. Most post-crisis early stories were darker. Superman was shown to get more optimistic over time, particularly after his Resurrection. That's what Zack was going for. All Star Superman makes sense because it's a tempered, older, wiser Superman. This Clark is young, impulsive, unsure of himself. It makes him relatable since as humans, we've all been unsure of ourselves. Hell, even Donner tried to have some of that, and the Salkinds forced him to neuter it because they wanted it to be like the campy 50s show. But take Reeve in context and he was by far the darkest version of the character at the time. He killed Zod, he gave up his powers for love, he resorted to angry violence against the trucker dude. And he had 10 more years of training in the Fortress than Cavill did, Cavill was literally being Superman with no training.   6. Can I ask why everyone calls Clark brooding here? Not once does he just stand on a rooftop and mope about himself like Superman Returns or most Batman movies. He doesn't act depressed, there's tons of great Superman smiles. The only part I could somewhat call brooding is when he asks the priest for help. But that's one of the most human moments of the movie because it shows again that Clark doesn't know all the answers. It's why he ends up being forced to kill Zod, Zod is still stronger than him, and the only reason Clark can kill him is because Zod let's him. It's suicide by cop. And after that, it's clear in his anguish that that is a catalyst for his growth from then on.     These are arguments I've heard before, and none of them really hold any water unless you went into the movie already expecting to dislike it.",1
"""cosmic horror"" lol",1
And you can rule out the billionaires using the above mentioned methods.,1
It was white washing then too.,2
And apparently they said no way that the Snyder cut would ever come out saying it’s a pipe dream ☹️. What a sad way to end the article.,0
"The way she worded the tweet doesn't convey that. Sorry. Like I said, we'll have to agree to disagree.",1
"If a man had done something similar to what Amber Heard did to Johnny Depp, he would have been publicly humiliated and fired from this franchise by now. I hope Amber gets her just desserts soon enough.",3
If Snyder was let go after MoS or BvS then JL might've ended up good.,2
"> The only poor part of BvS is the doomsday design   in your opinion yes, in mine there i alot of poor parts",1
I wonder what would have happened if The DC cinematic universe wasnt helmed by Zack Snyder..,3
"How is that unfair to fans of his work? The op is suggesting an optional filter that users can choose to use if they don't want to see Snyder Cut related posts. Fans of his work will still be able to see it. If anything, fans of his work should be excited by the thought of such a filter, because they would be able to more freely discuss Snyder Cut topics without being downvoted.",2
I agree - it's an interesting little part of her character history.,1
I’m right there with you boss. I just try my best to ignore a majority of those posts. We just need more Batman/WW84/BoP/SS news. Thankfully CCXP is right around the corner.,2
I don't understand how some Random person comes out of no where with this random news and gets this much attention ... this is super odd to me.,2
Klonk,0
"No need to gate keep or insult him. Sure Batman has killed in the Golden Age, he killed the Joker in TDKR (ambiguously), and in every live action appearance. But discussing this stuff with someone whom shares a different point of view shouldn't come with a combative and condescending tone.   I appreciate that your passionate about this though!",1
No shit haha. Did you not watch the film to understand why? Or does context not matter?,1
"Why would whedon carry over the bubble thing when it's going to cost money in new vfx for a small scene, it's likely a Snyder scene and they kept it because they didn't need to reshoot it",1
"The biggest problem I have is that Batman, the world's greatest detective, gets fooled so easily throughout the movie and doesn't find out Clark's true identity.",2
My man DDL is just a force of nature. It’s so impressive that Paul held his own against DDL,1
"Even if he's playing the Earth-23 version of the character, I have zero interest in a Superman movie not being about Clark Kent.",3
"Okay? He’s dealing with his legs being crushed. But sure, they could have acted that scene in a way to show him asking for his daughter or something if that was what they were pursuing. But again, dudes legs were crushed, he’s a bit occupied.  And think about it again, Lex was keeping the checks from Wallace, but he was also keeping Bruce from knowing that Wally wasn’t getting them. When Bruce asks Greg “why haven’t I seen these?” And Greg said he doesn’t know and they are working on it, THAT was Lex. Lex intercepted Wally’s checks and then sent them to Bruce with the red writing. Lex even says that when talking to Superman on the rooftop. “Two years brewing but it did not take much to push him over actually. Little red notes, a Big Bang, you let your family die!”",0
The weight of the rocket is mostly distributed on his hands. The building was way too large to keep intact.  Also when did he shift a tectonic plate?,0
It's a sequel to the comic set 34 years later.,1
This guy gets it!,0
I wouldn't count on it,2
Live action Mary Poppins and a Transformers spin-off no one asked for? Spider-Verse was in its 2nd week... Imagine any live action Marvel franchise going against that lineup and calling it competition.,0
Honestly the fact that they put a Hyena in BoP is like a legit fanboy moment lol,3
"I'm pretty sure those are fake news about SW being reshot and re-edited atm, because the movie here overseas is already submitted it's runtime and probably at the moment they are translating it for the release, there is no way you can reshoot and reedit the movie 1 month before release. They can work on CGI and other post production but that's it.",1

There's no safe place to shoot a person with that.   He could have just shot the wall next to them, there is a hole in the wall after all.   >Batman isn't reliable. I don't trust his version of events.  Batman isn't shown to be unreliable except for when he probably killed the Joker and miller made it clear that he was being unreliable in that moment, there isn't anything else to suggest he was being unreliable in that moment, especially then the commissioners comments weren't even told from Batman's point of view.  >I'd also like to point out that the new commissioner's list of charges is interrupted. It ends in a ""..."" because she had more to say.   If she thought batman killed the mutant she should have said it first as she was specifically targeting Batman in her opening adress, and if Miller wanted you to think he killed the mutant he would have made it clear by having Yindel go after him for murder.",1
OK thank you.,1
Looks like the car form the movie Upgrade.,1
Why do you want a MCU copy?? WB said that they are focusing on quality solo movies now and joker proved that just month ago. It is better to make exceptional solo movies than mediocre theme park movies,2
"Agreed seems like most want that very on the nose MCU oh look it's all connected shared universe. Remember that moment , remember this moment constantly instead of being focused on telling story.",1
It sounds like he has a little faith.,0
"But why would Robert have to ""badger"" Matt Reeves to ""secure"" an audition (article's words, not mine) if they were already interested on him?  I'd imagine that if Robert really was Reeves' top pick and that he wrote the script with him in mind, they'd give him an audition or even hire him on the spot.  Or they would be the ones to approach Robert on the first place instead of the other way around.",3
super nice guy too,1
It is based on reality.   Snyder is in fact in talks with WB. Confirmed by multiple people.   This isnt a 2 year old flop.   Its a unreleased film that a giant online base is calling for and has been calling for for 2 years.   If Mark hughes is 100% correct in the article. Then the cost to release it is solely paying actors and not finishing the film.   They just spent 5 billion on two tv shows. They need all the exclusive content they can get that will bring people to their service.   Especially considering they will be starting many months after every other streaming service.   That is the studio perspective.   The old mistakes of JL were the old regime. Under a different owner. They are now under ATT with new leaders across the board.    Their audience wants to spend money on this.,1
"He still used guns and murdered regardless. Ruined what could have been a damn near perfect Batman portrayal- big, intimidating, skillful in combat, but gun toting and homicidal? Naaa. The movie was wack on every other level; convoluted as hell. But you cared enough to reply to me just like how I cared enough to call it like it is. You dawn of justice/justice league defenders are just a delusional bunch.haha I hope the Snyder cut gets released someday, so that I can hop back on here and have some incels explain it to me in the comments.",0
"It goes even beyond just his greatest villain. Superman has Lex and Spidey has Goblin, but they’re still the same characters without those villains. Is a Batman without the Joker even really a Batman though?",3
Well he came out about Mustachegate. Close enough for someone who seems to avoid talking about JL at all.,2
"The movie may jump through time as the star staff, helm of nabu, and hawkman are relics of the past and can exist in multiple periods. Maybe the society defeats him in ancient times  and reforms as the JSA by the time he awakens.",1
"550 pages (minutes) for both was the original Mario Puzo script. Robert Benton and David Newman cut it down but it was still over 400 pages long for both. Ultimately Donner hated the script anyways (The Puzo script was very campy and reminiscent of the George Reeves show), so he brought on Mankiewitz to rewrite entirely. Not a word of the Puzo script ended up being used, but the Salkinds still gave Puzo the credit and Mankiewitz only got a Creative Consultant credit because the Writers Guild wouldn't accept any of his complaints.",1
"Lol, I feel it too, kind of crazy to see it unfold and redeem the art, raise awareness for suicide and just redeem Zack who has been through something that quite frankly no one should ever have to handle. I hope it's soon.",2

"I'm not against conlangs. If ZS was able to create a nice sounding Atlantean language, then why not, but IMO he was super reaching in his logic. Wan had them speaking underwater, but the effects to the voices made them really stand out. A film where a ton of the dialogue is clicking and squeaking just sounds bad to me.",2

"Yeah but Steppenwolf is a god that always looks like a human, not like a giant spiky shark man...",2
"They went from MoS, to him fighting Batman, to everyone fighting.  No amount of script can fix JL.  People are fired and hired to create a movie when the movie being made was a mistake to begin with. It is so dumb. The whole premise of the movie is extremely dumb.  They're doing well after Snyder. They should keep that momentum instead of reminding us of that bad narrative.",0
Why must you kick me when I'm already down?,2
"In 2016, Amber Herd came out and said that Johnny Depp had abused her. She included photos of her face showing multiple bruises, and released a video of him drunk and angry, slamming cabinet doors around her, throwing glass bottles, etc.  However, straight from the get-go, her story was flimsy; the video she made was shown to be edited, taken out parts where she seemed to interrogate him and kinda mock him. The reason he was drunk and upset was because he had just found out his mother passed away. Multiple friends and other police officers said that the photos showing her bruises were nothing more than make-up.  Ten days ago, Johnny Depp filed a lawsuit against her. Today, the documents were released to the public.  In short, the documents alleged that Amber Heard lied about literally everything and instead, she was the abuser. There was a time where she apparently hit him so hard that a portion of his finger tore off, then she also allegedly said under oath that she was the one to constantly attack him and this whole thing wasn't for money but instead just to advance her acting career. Johnny Depp submitted 87 sets of surveillance footage of his house to the courts, which show that there wasn't a single case of abuse. There was apparently a few times where she punched and kicked him, with one time being said where he was late to her birthday party so she punched him in the face, etc. Those attacks were regularly seen by friends, security, etc.",3
"They look great, so much potential wasted unfortunately.",3
"Dude, it’s LEX. He has the knowledge and resources to do just about anything as seen with his entire plan. He can bribe, he’s willing to assassinate, he can falsify records. I’m not saying this is what happened, but given everything else that Lex has done in this film it’s not a huge leap in logic for me to think that he could have done that as well.",0
Kay dude,1
"I think the scream sums it up nicely.  Yes, you are correct he did now before going into the fight.  I he did try to convince him, Batman laid on the guns and the noise machine and screamed in his face! He did take a risk but don't you think he would do whatever he had to even if it including killing him if he wouldn't desist?  In regards to this point whether it was coincidence or not doesn't matter. When he picked up the spear it was time.  They survived the blast but they aren't human are they. Batman only just, due to his cover. Doomsday could have jumped to another area within seconds. We know that Doomsday gets more powerful every time he is attacked or blows off an energy wave. It's already a difficult fight. We don't know how powerful he would become. He was about to blow again. Superman would rather end himself than Doomsday take out Bruce.",1
"I don't . I mean it's anecdotal, but that was one of the biggest positives from my group about JL.       You are bringing up moments, I'm talking about characterization. Yea, First Flight is terrific, but people cheered when he shows up and delivered the Justice line in JL (yea it's corny, but that OK from Superman).  Sure, the opening CG is terrible in JL , but the sentiment, the characterization is more of what the audience wanted.      This part is just me, but I want Snyder's visuals with Whedon's (or something like it) characterization. I honestly don't understand how to this day some fans just don't understand that for a VAST MAJORITY of the audience this characterization of Superman didn't land. I'm not saying, you shouldn't like it or that it was terrible. It just didn't connect with the audience in the way that I think Cavil wanted. That should be enough to change course.",1
Henry has said nothing but positive things about his experience working with Zack on Man Of Steel. That was their baby.,1
"Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Shazam, Suicide Squad, and Joker will make more profit than BvS. Even taking home video into account, according to Deadline, BvS only made 100 mil in profit. Aquaman and Wonder Woman are close to 300 mil, Suicide Squad around 150 mil, and Joker will likely end up with 500 mil in profits. Again, these are all Deadline's numbers which is a reputable source.  So you are wrong at every turn.",2
The Shazam bit made me sad. Would have been so cool to see Cavil in that end scene,2
"The Shazam thing was the director’s idea, as he wanted to have Cavill but time constraints didn’t allow it. The CW uses Barry Allen despite Ezra being still in the role. The talks with JJ have not said anything against or with Cavill, he even previously worked on a Superman film that was gonna star him.  The MJ thing could perfectly be bs or an Elseworlds Earth 2story, nothing negating Cavill.   I understand your intent but you kinda jumped in some points, and I don’t think it’s necessary. Hoping for the best too here!",3
It's also really hard to get emotion into a scene when you are given so little time that you can only do one or two takes and then must move on to the next scene.,1
"There are many similarities between the CW and Titans' Deathstroke, that being said they are as amazing as each other. My only wish is to have more scenes of Slade in the outfit.",1
A press conference may be ?,1
That would be perfect for adaption on the big screen. I want a Superman hero with heart and a lot smaller in scale. A personal story,2
Bubbles are for privacy. As explained in Aquaman.,3
But you have no evidence that Deadline got BvS's profits wrong and that they got the profits every other DCEU movie wrong. You have no sources mate.,2
"They seem pretty recognisable to me (and do you not know that Harley Quinn is meant to be ridiculous and has always worn a ridiculous costume?), the posters looked fine, and I don't know what was horrible about the trailer. You're just being hyperbolic here.",0
He doesn’t know.,3
I just finished 52 and loved his arc in that. I hope at some point they pull from that.,1
Age of Ultron ws always unpolished,2
"Honestly, as a huge fan of John Williams, I feel like Hans Zimmer's theme (and just the overall MoS and BvS soundtrack) captures Superman's world much better. At least the Post-Crisis/Rebirth Superman. There is hope, there is optimism, but there is also doubt and despair. But even after everything, hope always returns. Williams feels more fitting for the Golden and Silver Age Superman (which, to be fair, was exactly the current Superman at the time those movies were made).",2
They can have someone in mind when writing the role. It just depends if that person is interested or not.,3
"> Black Canary is being criticized the hardest by fans  They're obviously pulling from a recent run on the character, and it annoys me that people are getting upset over her because the run was really fun and interesting.",0
"Why would they feel betrayed when HBO Max, WB or Warner Media have said nothing about debuting the Snyder Cut on HBO Max? HBO Max literally just had a media day for investors weeks ago listing their upcoming slate and a director's cut of JL wasn't mentioned even though they had a DC segment. Creating a hashtag telling people to cancel a service because you didn't get a movie that was never stated to be released is the definition of fanboy entitlement.",3
"We, who like the new direction WB is taking.  There are two DC camps, new direction, and the old direction. They are mutually exclusive.  We choose the new one.",1
You don't know what Whedon was privy to or not privy to.,2

"I mean this is fine, but it’s going to seem corny to some and outdated to most. I thought Superman Returns did a good job of updating Boy Scout Superman, like when he saves the plane from crashing but then tells the passengers not to let it put them off to flying because it’s still the safest way to travel. That allows him to be cool while still being big blue.",1
"I'm also a Hot Toys collectors. He say's he works for Sideshow not Hot Toys, he just has the information about them. It is completely unverified. No one is saying it isn't  Steppenwolf's design for BvS would obviously of carried over to Justice League where he was the main villain. For all we know the figure could have been close until WB changed the design.  Irrelevant of Man of Steel Hot Toys, the BvS Hot Toys were very successful were they not?  How many were there? 8? Don't you think in 2016 they would have had bigger plans until Justice League bombed?  I don't think it's out fo the question they would have Steppenwolf for JL1 and Darkseid for JL2.",0

I suppose so. Sorry for being pedantic,1
I completely get that but that’s pretty much all we’ve gotten so far. I like seeing him fight alongside Superman and Wonder Woman. I loved Nolan’s realistic take on the character but loved that this was something different.,1
Mostly its what he learned working with Jay Oliva.  And proof given to him of how complete it was by Jay oliva.,3
the fuck?,2
I don't know--the best modern Superman comics still manage to put these types of moments in otherwise bombastic and thematically rich stories.   I always thought BVS would have benefitted a lot from adapting the iconic All-Star Superman suicide jumper page as a quick vignette in its late first act/sometime in the second. It'd be a testament to Superman's character and also highlight the division between him and Batman.,2
Wait until the movie comes out. Test screenings have been very positive.,1
I wouldn't object to a GLC film of course but I agree with you.,1
Yup. Very good in rounders,1
"I mean, that's specifically because the Atlantean guard are after them, it's not the same kind of air bubble that's used in JL, Wan's comments on the air bubbles on twitter:  >""Fret not, no 'air bubbles for dialogue' in my underwater world  implies that the way Snyder used them are not the same way that Wan was using the air pockets, so I don't think Snyder specifically used them for privacy, but just for dialogue, but we don't have snyders word on the feature, so I can't really say one way or another.   EDIT: I've just seen Snyder's comments on it from a post in this thread, Snyder didn't use it for privacy, he used it so the atlanteans could speak English as he doesn't like talking underwater anyway and feels the atlanteans would have a different language that's not like human ones anyway.   I still feel it was completely unnecessary though",2
I'd be down for it. Jonathan Crane is just as bat shit crazy as the joker is.,1
That would be so pointless... but to be fair they did a third WW origin movie recently too.,2
They cast him quicker and sneakier than Liverpool signed Fabinho,1
"Yes, he’s purposefully ridiculous in those movies but he’s fucking awesome in other stuff.",1
"Thank you so much! Would love to see a Snyder Cut comic as well! Hell, why not Zack's full 5-movie vision as a series? You'll probably have to get a better artist than me, tho!",1
"When the Snydercut comes out, if the Atlanteans don't enter the scene with an explosion then I'm gonna take the Aquaman atlanteans over JL.",2
"Ofc he knows, i did not mean to imply that. It was just funny the way he worded it “ My pick is Joaquin”, as if that is not the case for most people who ve seen joker :)  thats just it.",1
Oscar Issac for Ra's Al Ghul origin story.,2
That’s a very good question. It’s pretty hard to answer but maybe that’s why Snyder has Martian Manhunter in the film. He probably planned on doing the same thing like the Death of Superman animated movie.,1
"Weird, I have some problems with Zack but I like listening to him, he just seems down to earth.",1
>Watching this scene on the big screen was one of my favorite moments in theaters.  So True !!,1
Def a HBO stunt now.,2

It Exists Though. It's not imaginary.......,1
"Ditto. I hope he designs a poster for a future movie or something, that would be amazing.",3
Yeah I can't see the trailer speak being anyone but Steppenwolf  At best it was Desaad he spoke to.  Also does Darkseid even have any lines in the Snyder Cut aside from the ending?,1
Ladies and Gents enjoy the ride we are making history and as a fandom I couldn’t be happier. It’s only a matter of time. We do this for Zack we do this for Autumn we do this for Artistic freedom we do this for suicide prevention we do it for Justice and to all the doubters the ones who kept trying to sweep it under the rug saying it didn’t exist. I say this Fuck You All!!  Seriously no harm in the vulgarity just a nice way to say don’t ever doubt the dream !!,3
Yay! 😁 I wasn’t 100% sure!,1
"Also, the aesthetics was the least of it's problems.",2

Okay?  What’s your point?,0
80 pages is about 80-90 minutes usually. The rule of thumb is one page equals about a minute on screen,2
Uh..well my lord and savior is Jesus Christ.   Moviecritics don’t determine whether a film is good or bad. Initial reception doesn’t either.   Yeah I’m a fan. I’m also a fan of Spielberg because I think he makes good films...most of the time. Your point?   Here I’ll throw a wrench in the mix; I thought Sucker Punch was bad.,1

"Yes, badass, scary, and alien. Really shows you that shit is about to go down.",1
"> What exactly are you basing your personal belief on that all these people from the Snyder Cut movement actually plan on watching a leaked or pirated version instead of the real thing?  I am basing it on the reality that, for people who *aren't already paying for an HBO service*, HBO Max is basically offering them a single finite product they want, and once they see that single finite product, paying $15 a month for it is pretty unlikely.  (Yes obviously someone could want repeat viewings but I find it hard to believe the Snyder cut is good enough to justify paying $15 a month for to watch)  You're looking at this decision like HBO Max doesn't already have a ton of subscribers.  It comes with an HBO subscription, and I believe HBO Now and Go are being rolled into it, or something along those lines.  There's a good chance a lot of the people supporting the Snyder cut already have HBO lol.  It's in like 36 million households.  >I’m talking about business decisions because like it or not, faux pessimism or not, the hashtag trended like crazy last Sunday. There is clearly a big interest and desire for it, not to mention a lot more hype built around it than any other future DC film. A smart studio would definitely want to capitalize on the current “most talked about superhero movie”.  Yes, I'm not disputing any of this.  But you need to understand, from a cost benefit standpoint, funding it's completion has a poor outlook.  I know no one knows the official number, but a lot of people keep saying it's at least $10 mil and likely more.  So, to be generous, I'll say $15 mil.  At $15 a month for the service, HBO would need *1 million new HBO subscribers* who are *only* subscribing for the Snyder cut and *would not* subscribe without it for the funding of the project to be worth it.  Now yes, anyone who stays longer than a month reduces that number from 1 million.  But again, from a logical standpoint, why would anyone from *this specific* group of new Snyder Cut Only subscribers stay?  Are they getting more Snyder content down the line?  If they do it sure as hell isn't going to be DC related, right?  It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a business standpoint.  It would be like if you and your girl were both cheating on each other and both knew the relationship probably isn't going to last, and decide to get married.",0
WHO'S PLAYING DOCTOR FATE?,1
"Personally I think Man of Steel should be subtitled as Birthright, like Man of Steel: Birthright or Superman: Brithright.   This shouldn’t be confused with comic of the same name, but I think the name “Birthright” really plays up the importance of Argo City, Kandor, Brainiac, Supergirl and Superman’s true mission and legacy. Which is about building a better world, rebuilding Krypton and creating new technology.",1

I’m not saying hope should at all be dismissed, but to resign him to those two basic notions, especially something as subjective and empty as “happy,” is doing a severe injustice to the character. He inspires with his actions. And to do so he has to reflect the modern person so he can build trust. He reaffirms to people that being better isn’t just a Superman trait, but something everyone can accomplish. The further he gets from resembling the people the harder that is.",2

Oooo that would be awesomeeee. At least we're (hopefully) getting a long Halloween adaptation with Pattman.,2
I loved him in The Big Lebowski. Small role but a lasting impression,2
I share the sentiments. Everyone here thinks Snyder is way better than he actually is.   He coined a stellar shooting style and then outside of 300 it just feels wrong.   300 excelled because it's minimal story with a lot of action. So when he moved on to other movies that were more intuitive he falls behind.,1
It's canon in the comics now that Joker might not age.  The final scene with the therapist is likely 20+ years in the future and Arthur looks the same.,1

"You can certainly say in theory that they speak in clicks and squeaks. But in terms of what we actually hear on screen, they should be in English, because that's convenient.   The solution to this problem shouldn't be subtitling their clicks and squeaks, or creating an air bubble so it ""makes sense"". The solution is just to present it as is and trust the audience to understand why they're speaking English. We can suspend our disbelief.",3
"Turturro is a wonderful character actor, so his interpretation of the Crime Boss might surprise us all. Reeves’ picks for this Bat Cast has been nothing short of refreshing.",3
"Hey, my new screensaver!!",1
"Good and bad is subjective when it comes to art, but yeah, Superman Returns was disliked by the audience. So despite Superman's popularity, it's not that easy to make a financially successful movie about him. And if a previous movie about character X flopped, it becomes even more difficult to promote another movie about him. Did you really expect MoS to make a billion?",1
The Question by David Fincher  Deadshot by Michael Mann,1
Who is also a huge New Gods fan and is being assisted by the man who wrote Mr. Miracle’s recent run (considered by some to be one of the greatest comics of 2018),1
That quote comes from the guy at BoxOffice.com not WB.,2
"I love The Last Jedi, I’ve heard all the complaints, I just don’t see them.",0
Lol it’s impossible.The movie is nearing the end of its  run,3
The Dark Knight transitions right into Batman & Robin. Wow.,3
I think Arnold Schwarzenegger would be the perfect choice.,1
Oh I actually I like them equally is what I should’ve said regardless of the action scenes haha. My bad,3
"I have no idea what they'll do in part 2, but if Joaquin Phoenix is willing to return, it has to be good. We all know he's picky with his scripts",1
Come on this is an excuse everybody is using now. There is no such thing.You know how many people are promoting supporting multiple projects while having Netflix movies?  Timothee Chalamet just spoke a lot about Dune a WB movie while promoting the King.  Maybe Cavill just wasn't on board with Snyder's vision and he didn't want to participate. Why can't people accept that? Stop finding excuses for it,3
"I felt like Manu’s version lacked consistency. He was scary during certain episodes, felt like he was just there at other points. Titan’s deathstroke feels like he’s gonna run his sword through our heroes’ hearts every scene he is in.",1
"I know many people want a break from Joker and it’s easy to see why considering how many actors portrayed him in the last 10 years or so, but let’s be real:   If The Batman is as good as we want it to be, if the villains in that movie are perfect, we all know that we will ask to see his Joker. And quite frankly, a whole Batman trilogy without his greatest villain just doesn’t feel right.",3
">You just negated your validity as a debater by going alone with the stupid boomer insult trend.   Yes, because using an applicable meme negates someone's ability to debate, not disregarding someone's entire argument because they got called you a word they don't like. Definitely not.   >This debate is over. I'm finished with you. Have a good night.   I hope you have a good night too, and I hope you soon realise you're wrong and do some research and become an empathetic human.",0
"Dammit, who here let Brett Ratner in?",1
To each their own i felt Diaz was a great villain equal to Deathstroke,1
"Not to mention, praising the SC could hurt Momoa's relationship with WB. He risks his career for the artistic vision he prefers.",3
"Cameron is also a huge perfectionist, so those scenes are going to look photo real. Should be pretty stunning.    I kinda hope that it will have some influence on Aquaman 2.",1
hey whatever floats your boat my man. And next year around this time when theres no snyder cut who are you going to blame then?,2
Didn’t stop DC from announcing BvS while MoS was still in theaters,1
"It’s so strange, I like BvS but had I said that I think it’s unabashedly a masterpiece I don’t think this sub would’ve bat an eye but I say I like The Last Jedi and feel like I saw a different movie than everyone else and suddenly I’m stupid.   I don’t really care what other think of the movie as long as I like it but damn, you’d think this sub would know that liking a movie others don’t doesn’t make you wrong.",2
That is personally my favourite design of Steppenwolf.,3
Reading this makes me wish they would've just told Joss whedon to fuck off and waited for Snyder,3
"[Forbes, on the other hand, says it will.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2019/11/26/dear-warner-bros-release-the-snyder-cut/)",2
"He doesn't have a valid point or the one hes trying to make is completely skewed and biased and when I addressed that, he hit me up with the equivalent of ""K"" at the end of the text message",1
They downvoted him for he told the truth,1
"I am really happy Joker passed the ""local superhero"" Papakaliatis...",2
"Well yeah, but you get what I was implying.",2
The Dark Knight standsout as it made 1B without China and before the market for comic movies even began!,1
"LOOKS SO GOOD, ugh... really want a solo DEATHSTROKE movie.   Whatever happened to Gareth Evans' movie?!",1
They never will. Which is why a modern day Superman movie will never be successful,0
"His movie never came out.   By his track record, his JL will be significantly better than whatever was in theaters.   Either get salty he keeps sharing JL stuff or ignore it. You’re choice bud.",1
"If it is 95%, WB are beyond idiots to spend millions of dollars on re-shoots, VFX changes etc;",1
I hate the lack of red trunks and the basketball texture of everything plus the muted colors but the S is literally the best version they've EVER put out before.,2
"I prefer Michael B Jordan, he's a better actor (and more sexy in my opinion) and it would be cool to have the inmigrant alien being black instead of the story of a ""white american"" that turns out to be an alien",0
You think you’re better than me cuz you got both your nuts?,3
I’d be mad he got with her over me.,1
We would have gotten an epic justice league 3 if it wasn’t for the fact we got part 2 and 1 taken from us.,3
When BvS came out it seemed like 99% of the fan base was shitting on Snyder. They said he ruined the movie so remove him and so on. Now people are demanding a Snyder cut of Justice league and I'm sitting here super confused lol,2
It’s horse shit.,2
"That Lex scene was still cool. It was shot by Zack, so...",3
I'm out of the loop. The Snyder cut that people want this time is referring to Justice League's director's cut?,1
"I more so meant overall looking like the character but none the less if it has to suit Jim Gordan, Starfire from titans, although her hair is dyed it looks pretty real.",1
"They'll need to callback to this movie someday if they have the lesser intentions to do another Justice League feature someday. It's a high profile brand and it's damaged now. If they just pretend that it never existed, it will only feed this past ghost for years and years.",1
I need some answers Ja just can’t give me right now!,2
Now did he say that bats and supes are the same characters who have the same tone? He didn't did he? My question still stands have you not seen some Snyder and DCEU fans hate shazam and other DC films because it didn't have the same tone of BvS.,0
I recently saw the animated movie “ Justice League: Gods and Monsters” and I think a movie with Michael C Hall as Kirk/Man Bat would be amazing .,0
"Maybe not but everything else was. Plus, the home media and DVD says have been enormous for BvS and MoS. Both AQ and WW barely scratch the surface of profit on the home media department, which is a big market btw. Over 100 million dollars in sheer profit for MoS alone.",0
"I think that actually sounds cool, but we gotta wait until after The Flash movie to start talking about it. I definitely could see it as a Deadpool-esque action comedy.",0
Way to deflect.,0
I cannot disrespect a great fictional character by comparing him with a real life clown,1
"I don't find JJ Abrams filmography particularly inspiring, especially if you compare it to say, Nolan.   Why do people rate him so highly as a director?",2
[I’m actually very excited for this movie](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/I-Know-Fuck-Me-Right.jpg),1
"Yes. Better than what we got. Also, for those of us who are fans of MoS and BvS, we will likely really enjoy what Snyder puts up on screen. He had already said BvS was the DCEU’s Empire Strikes Back, and would be the darkest, most complex film of the bunch. JL was a lot more straightforward, simple, and fun.",2
Probably Han’s best for me. Shame it doesn’t get enough love compared to Inception and TDK trilogy.,2
"Critics always hated him, not only saying that his vision sucks but calling him a bad person. Some quotes from Sucker Punch reviews:  Manages to be ugly, stupid, offensive, depressing, sexist and boring in equal measures.  Imaginary girl posse empowerment, or male fantasy sexualized violence? Entailing female fighter fashion statement armor comprising stilettos, fishnet, overflowing bosomy bustiers and big hair.  A creatively bankrupt succession of fetishy bromides -- steampunk, Asimov, medieval times, and (personal fave!) a woman in a sailor suit, sucking on a lollipop and calling it feminism 'cause she carries a gun, too.  It seems to have been made for 15-year-old boys by a sad middle-aged man whose only experience of life is from violent comics, shoot-'em-up video games and online pornography.  Proves that while masturbating over your cast may not make you blind, it can impair directorial vision  The hypocrisy of Sucker Punch is that it portends to supplant traditional objectified-female eroticism with violence, but all it does is turn said violence into another form of fetishized display for its largely male audience  ..this tricked up female empowerment tale undercuts itself with its fetishized slutty schoolgirls and its repetitious steampunk anime aesthetic.  That's one of the reasons I don't care about RT scores.",3
Routh Superman rumored for HBO Max,1
"This is how much hatred lowers people. *Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox* was the universally revered DC animated movie that kicked off the current generation of feature-length DC animation (you know, the one branch of DC that's always been cool to like in the 2010s?). Oliva directed both that AND the acclaimed two-part animated adaptation of *The Dark Knight Returns.* In short, this man is the real deal, and an unsung hero of the DC fandom for setting the DC animated movie bar as high as it was in the last decade.  The moment Oliva went to bat for the Snyder Cut, he was denied, dismissed, and disowned by those aggressively positioned against the truth. From the way some treated him for his advocacy, you would believe they didn't know who he was.",3
Damn dawg. I wonder how you handle every other movie in existence that introduces a handful of characters.,2
"Someone asked when Superman would be released, he couldnt even give a straight answer to that.   Its bullshit. Dont believe everything you see on twitter without factual proof.",1
It's not really modernized. It's the 1941 crest.   https://imgur.com/SVhUtJp,1
"Agreed, whether the Snyder Cut comes out or not, is canon or not. Superman is back and ready to be the inspiring Superman everyone loves. Just get on with it!",2
It’s a lot better than Arrow’s. Deathstroke on Titans is menacing and straight up scary at times.,1
Imagine if we were getting a Superman or GLC movie instead of this right now,1
"True. But all this denial will be so delicious when/if  the film is released, and I will savour every goddamn second of it.",2
You could use the letsenhance.io website,1
"Or you could interpret it that Snyder's idea is stupid, and they should just talk.",3
"> something would make you think he's .. going to help evacuate his building I guess?  well yeah that is what he's doing. The he sees it get decimated. He helps his employee and saves a little girl.   He is unable to help more and feels totally powerless, and this drives the entire rest of the movie.   So not really just to pin an action scene, but pretty much the thematic driving force of the whole thing.",3
Michael Bacall doesn't really act... so I dunno why you'd want him?,1
She is so fine.,3
The only complaint  story wise I’ve heard is about Superman killing Zod. Other wise I think people like the stories. That’s part of the reason why everyone was so hyped for bvs and mos. they have some epic stories.,0
He was in Thor 2 or 3 I think? I remember that it wasn't Zach as Fandral in Thor 1,2
"One super wacky Mister Mxyzptik movie, coming right up. Courtesy of DC Black.",2
I can't even piss *standing up*,2
I did read that but at 3 1/2 hours there’s no way that could’ve been his intended theatrical cut. Snyder knows how to make big crowd pleasing movies and although a lot of fans would enjoy sitting through a 3 1/2 hour movie that’s a lot to ask of the average film goers who I’m sure he still keeps in mind. To me it sounds like 214 minutes was always going to be a directors cut but even he had a shorter movie in mind for original release.,3
">Of course WB has proven they don’t need to only focus DC large connected big budget epics  They are making low budget films like Joker but also Aquaman 2, Wonder Woman 1984, New Gods, Black Adam and (hopefully) Flash. All these films are big budget films that are going to expand to universe much more than the Snyder's cut.",1
We want the movie,3
This should have been left alone. Joker may have been a quality movie but the controversy surrounding the movie is what propelled it to a billion. It became a cultural necessity to see. It will be very hard for a sequel to replicate that kind of success.,1
Him wanting to be Superman doesn’t mean it’s resolved. Ofc he’ll say he’s still Superman. Firmly in his heart and eyes and the heart and eyes of several fans he’s still Superman but that doesn’t mean things have been resolved.,2
No no no. It’s in the movie butchered and in the wrong ugly red background.,3
Because directors want to do other projects or characters. Here's to hoping the Abrams rumors are true,1
\#CatwomanWasFirst,1
To be fair joker is one of the best cmbs I've ever seen lol. I only watched that because of Phoenix and it being r rated. It's probably the only good thing to come out of ss flopping fan/critically  Everything else wb does can get fkd until they respect Zack's hard work and release his cut which the fans are begging for  In 2 weeks if they don't announce it I'm starting the boycott campaign,1
"So what''s with all the ""He DeMaNdEd FuLl CoNtRoL oF AlL ViLlAiN OrIgIn sToRiEs !"" ? That's a pretty specific take.",3
there do seem to be a lot of rumors that Jenkins is leaning into the cheesy pretty hard. Idk we'll see.,1
"I think that Rise of Skywalker has so many “ingredients” that I already love, that it’ll be very hard for me to dislike it. Even if I don’t love the plot or it’s not what I thought I wanted at first. To be honest, I don’t like a lot of important plot and character endings in Avengers: Endgame, but it’s executed so well that I’m able to accept it and genuinely love that movie. It gives me such joy watching it. I truly trust that The Rise of Skywalker will fill me with joy and excitement. No one will get the exact movie or ending that they want. But I’m prepared for that",1
"Man of steel is masterpiece, best Superman movie in my opinion, when bvs came out I was in love with the movie , I was so angry at the bad reviews I couldn’t understand why people hated the movie ,but now I REALLY don’t like the movie specially Superman i really don’t like Superman In the movie (still love Henry) and joker is masterpiece 🤗",0
People hate Snyder just because. That’s why.,3
Very hyped to have an Italian in the role.,2
If this were a political debate he'd have already gone on to calling everyone here a Nazi just to shut people up.,2
Damnit. I wanted to say exactly that 😂,1
Don’t cover up his beautiful chin 😔,3
"This was the perfect Comicbook movie opening, and I love the part when he saves the little girl and how angry he looks.",3
I never put full faith in their work until Variety confirms it.,2
"Man of steel was great, well worth a sequel of its own",1
So Eddie Redmayne? Sure.,1
The script literally says the words “Red Hood”.,3
"Then joker should count because Bruce had a face to face with Bruce. The chase scene counts also because Batman is interacting with joker just through actions, not through speech. And while we’re disproving that’s heath was the last one. Jeremiah and Jerome interacted with Bruce over the course of Gotham plenty of times",0
Agreed. I’m ready for another Batman movie but I fully expect it to be worse than Nolan’s which makes me lose interest.,1
"it’s just christoph, btw.",1
"Between them, Variety and THR (along with Deadline) broke Robert Pattinson as Batman, Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, Paul Dano as The Riddler, Colin Farrell as Penguin, Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon, Andy Serkis as Alfred, and John Turturro as Falcone.   What has Mark Hughes broken?",1
"I'd say a soft reboot would be good, Keep MoS, probably phase out BvS, and JL. Maybe retell the events of JL so that the death of Superman can be used again at some point and so that we don't have to have another JL movie where they're meeting for the first time.",1
Cmon bezos give us the money to finish it,3
">  I don't mind it when it's done well (as in the character's race/sexuality is not their central feature).  A black actor said he wanted to play an alien with traditionally white-looking features and people freaked out; who's really making race a central feature here? Not talking about you specifically, but I can't help but notice the irony of some fans frothing at the mouth at the thought of a character of *a different species* changing skin colors while in the same exasperated breath insisting that a character's race shouldn't matter.",0
Nobody in the GA cares about continuity.,2
"Dude, the reason tons of things get posted is because new stuff comes out every day from Snyder, Momoa, etc. It's a popular topic, that's not gonna change. Just like a few months back when BoP stuff was posted 1000+ times a day, or before that when Joker stuff was rapidly going up. Or now when we see as much Battinson stuff going up. People who aren't interested in Battinson don't complain that there's too much on the sub. Because it's just a naturally popular topic. If you're not interested, you can skip past it. It's really easy to just scroll some pixels down past it. Lord knows I honestly couldn't have cared about Joker stuff at first (Yeah, I wasn't on board until the later trailers). I still dealt with it.",2
"2004 Joker fits perfectly into the “Thank You, Not You” meme from about a year ago.",0
"Where are you getting three scores from? There's one released and, from this, a second unreleased one by Holkenborg.   Hybrid is legit regardless. I don't expect people to believe otherwise without knowing the site's history, though.",1
Yes. Thank you. People in this sub need to get more acclimated with this quote because I maintain that going against it really hurt the DCEU.,2
"I still think it would have been a mess, just a preferred mess. I will say, Whedon did give us a GREAT superman, though. Sp, if they could just leave Whedon's superman scenes in for the snyder cut, that'd be great.",0
"So now we all definitely know(not that we didnt before) that all of the casts saying ""its still Zack's movie and Whedon is just completing his vision"" is just a sack of bullshit. 80 pages...holy crap and the movie still flopped to both hardcore and casual fans. WB really strong armed the cast to lie about this. Can't imagine how Zack felt. He got fired during a tragedy, a new director comes in who he thought would just complete his cut but ends up butchering his movie with lame jokes and irrelevant plot (obv not just Whedons fault).  Now I know why even Ben decided to support the Snydercut after all this time. They were basically lying through their teeth these past 2 years.",3
How the fuck do you know it’s gonna be a dumpster fire?,3
I just want a Joker in the Pattinson universe  He doesn't have to be a main villain just yet but I think he should be in that universe,1
It looks better tho. His padding works under low light pretty well and you mate it more cinematic. That's how creativity and cinema works. Don't care about people who wants everything brighter than normal.,1
I want to see multiple villains in each movie. It's not like Hollywood is going to make more than a trilogy and batman has quite a few villains. Most of all I would love a batman and robin. There was a scene in Titans where Dick is in a warehouse and he grapples to the ceiling and the camera loses track of him and he kicks everyone's ass. I loved it. It would be nice for batman to do a little detective work too.,1
"People have to think, what if this was your first ever exposure to Superman? I honestly don't recall one really inspiring line that would make me care about him, I care about him because of other properties. Even now I'm looking at BvS and Man of Steel quotes on Rotten Tomatoes and he just doesn't have anything meaningful to say.   Rather than the gloominess I think what's off putting is how directionless Superman is. The audience never gets much of a chance to celebrate Superman for what he is, a hero.   Look at the day of the dead scene where people are trying to touch him. The audience sees the people rooting for Superman as desperate, miserable and downtrodden people but you don't get the feeling he's giving them hope or inspiration, it looks like a cult.",0
Isis? Ike,1
"Idk its kinda easy, you know? Like yeah he played hannibal and modern calendar man os inspired by him but it's just kinda meh to me.",3
"Yes PLEASE!!! That’s all I care about, Bering Henry back!",1
"The whole point of that ending was to put Superman in a no-win scenario.  The point was to actually test the character because that's the only way they grow and evolve.    The only way ANYTHING evolves is by deconstruction.  If we all just agreed with everything and said it was great we wouldn't even have any of these movies.  We'd be stuck with old 30's monster movies where you can see the string.    Zack's approach was right for Superman and Batman.  Challenge them, find out why they do what they do, what it would take to break their moral codes, what makes them tick, then redeem them.  You're understanding them from the inside-out by deconstruction.  Sometimes the execution, pacing, and efficiency was off in the movies, but I loved all of it.",1
Never thought I’d see Doctor Fate in Live action! Incredible can’t wait for this movie!,1
Oops! Spelled his name wrong...,1
your comment just reminded me that the women in the basement even explicitly call him a 'demon' - so the angel/devil metaphor still applies there too! Thanks,1
"Thank you! Appreciate the kind words. Hopefully a real line of figures based on Snyder's JL does come out. Knightmare Flash, Battle Mode Cyborg w/multiple arms and the BvS Steppenwolf",1
"yeah, lets get someone else for a potential Lex movie please. Joker is great but you need a little more nuance for a Lex-running-for-president story",2
You mad bro? Lol,1
She's pretty but she's not a Selina Kyle.,0
"Plus, none of those movies have made massive profits on the home media sales, which is more important then ever nowadays. Especially with streaming being such a big deal. All of Snyders movies make absolute profit with that too. So overall the success of BvS is strong and longterm. Not short bursts and a ""critical darling"" that will be forgotten in a few months.",0
Mark Waid would disagree,0
Zack confirmed on Vero  Edit: but you are right article is shit.,1
"Aquaman was trash tho, pls remove",0
Yes but that has nothing to do with him being Bruce Wayne. It sounds like he just said it because bats live in caves,0
"Actually, Gotham City Sirens will be the next Harley Film most likely.",1
"It resembles what guardians of an ancient relic might wear as per tradition, whereas by Aquaman solo they have modern style on the current guards.  The Mother Box location was kept secret, so it's likely a series of families inheriting armour over generations, whereas the rest of Atlantis, like IRL, wear modern tech. It's like the Queen's Guard in the UK. Maybe not the absolute best but you can't beat tradition.",3
Is that bud or lou?,1
"no not this, there were many more scenes that you did not cover. this is still half whedon's.",1
I think the SS version is my least favorite. It's bad enough to scrap her entire look but they could have at least kept her signature color palette.,1
">None of the Apokolips crowd make for particularly compelling big screen villains imo, so maybe another route would've been a better bet than the standard alien army invasion pla  EXACTLY. Which is why I was hoping for throne of atlantis",1
"People can’t even accept a black Superman. They aren’t going to accept Asians who are practically nonexistent in films. We are just getting better representation for blacks in films and people are slowly embracing it. No way Asian superman would get better reception. The closest we got was Dean Cain and he looked white enough to where people didn’t care, also this was before the whole “anti-SJW/woke culture” that Ben Shapiro and the cool kids philosophers gangs begun indoctrinating into American culture.",1
Tbh Zari has so little connection to the character I don’t think it’d make a difference,1
What Execs?,1
It's on the front page for the sub here. Elfman said Zack never finished his movie because he had to leave production which is what was in line with what was said after release until Snyder kept releasing story boards and then mamoa said he see the cut so now everyone is calling Elfman a liar,0
GOD i cannot wait for this movie. Shazam really blew me away.,1
Into the Toddverse,1
batman looks like a fat redditor trying to cosplay,1
BvS especially. There isn’t a single flaw in Afflecks performance imo,2
That would’ve been dope.,1
"This. No one knew who he was and now he has bunch of fans riding him online, giving him attention and so on.  New Gods is in works so he might also be trying to get a gig there through this. Which obviously don't seem like something that's gonna happen normally.",2
"*MCU creates the highest grossing movie of all time*  ""With Marvel dying...""",2
Also notice how the CGI is in the very early stages...,3
So they are not friends? Wow what a shocker. I don’t care lol and nobody does what they do in their personal lives. That’s my opinion at least.,1
"Well, if the story/script is good, I don't see any reason for him to not return.",1
I'm of the mindset that if justice league was a smash hit he should've been removed from the role. His Batman in justice didn't look good and you could tell his heart wasn't in it anymore,1
"The thing with Snyder's vision, is it was always meant to end up more optimistic. Just like Post-Crisis Supes, he had to die to truly become that type of Superman. The difference is under Snyder it would've been a more serious optimism like Donner's movies. Under Whedon we got dumb Lester and Quest for Peace level material.  You can't base anything off of Cavill's statements near the TC. Everyone was hyping the TC (Except Jason, he always was more put-off by it) for a while. Even Ray who was basically cut out of the movie.  I'm just saying, Cavill always seemed more comfortable playing Supes under Snyder compared to the wooden acting he gave in the Whedon cut.",2
It's Xebellian armor. You can see it in Aquaman.  The white armor is mainstream Atlantean military armor.,3
Tell me that about 6 years ago,2
She just says what everybody want to hear. I can not believe that people think that this kind of social media personalities have any reliability.,1
Hey hey relax on the condescension. I watched the movie repeatedly and understand why Batman was like that and what inspired that version. I just didn’t like it or think it was the best version of Batman to lead a new cinematic universe with.,2
"Imagine being in that situation and then instead of using the original director's footage, reshooting 3/4 of the movie from your previous experience in a similar field but  with a completely different aesthetic, ruining it, and delivering an entirely different end result.",0
BvS is the only Batman film that actually confronts Batman about killing and makes him realize why it's wrong and how he slipped up. Nolan's and Burton's films had far more kills but their films didn't acknowledge it,3
"Right, didn't terrio complain that John's kept rewriting his original script",3
Character,1
"> Snyder fans got AQ to 1 billion  Did they make James Wan's Furious 7, Saw franchise, and Conjuring Universe billion dollar properties too?",3
"Yup, they haven’t taken crazy liberties with anything important and they’ve said they want to respect the source hard on this event.   Perfect to just kick back and enjoy the library of DC they’re going to pull from.",1
"Boo, it's a nice moment",3
The same people that are praising this ridiculous departure from the source material by changing the whole DESIGN  are the same people that pretend to be disappointed with Birds of Prey because the characters don’t have their  OUTFITs from the comics.  Nerd hypocrisy will always amaze me.,2
As the other person said. The writer was citing their ‘inside source’ so it could be completely wrong,3
"It would have been interesting to see his take on Shazam -- he's typically associated with darker material, but I bet he could pull it off.",1
Gender swapping and race bending is just bad,3
But Joaquin Phoenix never would do a sequel,1
"And to that Zack Snyder replied ""I feel you""   Don't post incomplete shit.",2
>	looks the part more than any living human being on the planet  *Matt Bomer has entered the chat*,0
These are in the theatrical cut. Don’t look too much into it.,3
I've always felt hes great as superman. Like everyone his character needs better production and direction.i still think he should stay as superman.,1
"I believe MBJ is one of the best actors working today! However!, I believe he has played enough superheroes. F4, BP, and Chronicle. Give some one else a shot... or ya know... KEEP HENRY",0

"I’m probably one of few people who hasn’t watched Stranger Things or IT yet, so I know nothing about his acting skills.   Kind of has the look at least.",1
Explained it when they go to the boat.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWBHJ8WCIIE,2
There's a new kind of mean in him .. He's angry & HE IS  HUNTING,3
I'd say that argument still holds up against Keaton. Keaton only works in Burton's hyper idiosyncratic world.,0
"Ah yes, the sources that are so high up they even trascended the concept of names.",0
I mean. We dont know the context zack filmed this in.   And I throw Josstice league under the bus because it was lamely filmed. Doesnt look very good as well as being clunky.   Now I agree. Just go with talking underwater but he has very little underwater scenes and this one looks to be really pretty overall.,2
"Nah, you are you just delusional. Deadline is more reputable than your petty ass will ever be.",2
"It's not so much that the ""SC doesn't exist"" but rather it's discarded takes that have not completed editing and/or post processing so if you released the movie half of it would be in a different audio/visual Fidelity than the rest of the movie.  So you can either convince them to splice back in the unedited scenes (not likely as the finished product would not look professional or acceptable at all) or convince them to retouch / process the scenes which is very expensive so they would need a good financial reason to do so and it's unlikely to make enough money to warrant it.  At the end of the day they're still a business trying to make money and the amount of people interested in the SC just isn't really enough to warrant it.  So if you really want a con, it's ""WB will lose a lot of money appealing to a vocal minority and that hurts future DC film prospects""",1
"To be fair, even when WB decides to release it (Yes, WHEN), it'll take time for us to actually know. We don't know what effect Sunday had.",1
"Well said. They would rather put that 40 million to refine the unfinished VFX. I guess we won't be getting a different design for Steppenwolf. We might not even get the Snyder Cut. But, personally, it isn't the Snyder Cut if it doesn't even have Snyder's fav design in it.",0
"I think I'm okay with Ben not being Batman anymore because he didn't want to. But if WB decides to reboot Superman without Henry, who still very much wants to keep playing Supes, then I'd be pissed.",2
"It's actually pretty obvious, batman becomes the killer and Superman becomes the child at that point, I don't know why it foew over so many people's heads.",0
He 100% did believe in Snyder’s vision. Taking the Batman reception all while dealing with alcoholism was a totally different thing though. I think he was definitely in it till the end.,3

Lol. That's hilarious.",1

The level of coherency you speak of is non-existent my friend.",0
"Principal photography ended in October 2016. Zack starts working on VFX heavy shots while doing principal photography or even earlier. That’s why those 2 vfx guys Brian Hirota and John “DJ” Desjardin said that most of the vfx shots in the Snyder cut are complete.  Edit: Also Zack “shoots what he draws” and he draws his own storyboards. So there’s no need for additional retakes/reshoots after principal. He has a clear vision for how the movie is going to progress from start to finish which helps him cut his movie quickly.   He may need brief pickup shots due to an actor’s scheduling or lower priority shots which are very short like Harry Lennix’s MM transformation shot which was probably only a few seconds but nothing for any of the main cast members.   Since JL was shooting in the UK, it was not viable flying Lennix all the way from LA just for a 5 seconds shot. So that’s why Zack said he intended to shoot the Lennix part in LA later.",3
"I think in all three instances, Zod/Batman/Doomsday, there's aspects and details that just make this interesting character arc get lost.  Firstly with Zod there's the simple problem that Clark never reflects upon or even acknowledges what happened that day. He has an anguished scream after he kills Zod and then the only other time he alludes to that day is when he tells Martha ""I just wish dad had been here to see it"". Hardly the words of a man struggling to process the gravity of those events.  With the Batman v Superman fight the implausible way in which he tries to ""reason"" with Batman just doesn't help to sell that he's actually learned anything from his previous experiences. Instead of simply trying to restrain Batman he pushes him violently down and street and then throws him for good measure too. How could he possibly expect Batman to listen to him after that? People aren't going to buy meaningful character growth if a character acts in a way that's just not believable.  With Doomsday the issue is simply that the execution made his sacrifice look unnecessary. ""Why not just give the spear to Wonder Woman?"" If the execution was believable nobody would ever think to ask that question. If you show the audience *and superman* that Wonder Woman is invulnerable and a skilled fighter then you have to take her out of commission in a believable way that would leave Superman with a tangible choice to make. Sure he's *kinda* shown making a choice. (This is my world, you are my world). But him making that choice doesn't undo the fact that it looks unnecessary. If he *actually* had no choice then it would have felt far more meaningful.",1
Clearly the special effects are not done. This is in black and white and would take millions and millions of dollars to complete. /s,3

"It boggles my mind why WB specifically dumped a completed score just to spend more money on a score that didn't even fit the movie at all. JL wasn't nearly grand enough for Williams' score, didn't have the gothic darkness needed for Elfman's Batman theme (Lest we forget that Batman Returns is still by far the darkest Batman movie?), and in every other track was forgettable. They even ruined Diana's theme. That guitar riff was awesome and they ditched it for a generic Elfman violin. Ugh.",1

matt reeves already said his movie is trilogy similar to apes,1
Dont think anyone really blamed Snyder for the outcome of the movie itself.  Just how his previous offerings really set the entire venture back and led to the Studio Execs to panic and meddle instead of staying put or pulling the plug and taking more time to fix things.  I dont have faith that a Snyder cut would be good even (something led to them wanting to meddle like they did) but if it's something easy to fix together then getting the Snyder cut out would at least be a fair bit of closure for those who were enjoying it and worked on it.  The reshoots had the damming effect of pissing off the loyal fans who did appreciate their vision.  Changing half-assedly towards appeasing fans like me who were turned off by the original vision without delaying the film was just a terrible idea anyway.,2

In hand to hand combat, he doesn't stand even 2 minutes against Batman.  Did you notice how the Joker isn't a proper boss (even when he was on Titan) in the Arkham games despite being the main villain?   You just punch him.  A physical Batman villain is Bane or Deathstroke.",1
Kind of. IIRC He almost chooses to wear the black suit but then decides to keep wearing the brighter colors.  [yeah he turns away from it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWgQtaVQn7w),2

I just think the studio wants to move on entirely from him.",3
"They wouldn't get egg on their face.  New company.  New CEO.  New just about everything since JL.  They don't have to make a big deal of it when they drop it on HBO max.  Just release it, say it's for the loyal fans, and run off.",1
">So, Batman being as trained as he is, wouldn't know how to incapacitate people without injuring them fatally and would leave bodies in his wake. Okaaaay.  I'd say it's in line with The Dark Knight Returns take on Batman (who in turn was inspired by golden age Batman), but really it's just the idea of someone doing what batman does in a real world setting that would result in some deaths.

I mean for good reason. I don't care for JL but that was a very tight amount of time. Everything else he's done is pretty iconic,1
"Exactly, Snyder never wanted him to be hopeful and optimistic. WB had to force his hand for that.  As for the original cut, if it were actually hopeful, they wouldn't have gone through massive reshoots trying to make it so. Was very likely typical needlessly mopey and broody stuff which he always does.  Keep believing what you feel like and I'll go off what I've seen of him and what I believe him capable of.",0
Nah it not that he already stated in a article he didn't like the theatrical version that was released. It was because of the reshoots that Whedon did was the reason for the whole mustache thing. Snyder version was already done with superman.,0

">There is an article written by Jon Arryn Garza on ReelAnarchy website.  >He went deep into the theatrical cut, leaked scenes, and trailer shots and found out that only around 42% of JL belonged to Snyder.   Interesting.  Most people have been guesstimating for the last year and a half or so that I thought about 40% was Snyder's (but obviously altered / changed, like the Memorial Park fight being put in the day rather than at night, etc). So interesting to know that gels with what that dude calculated.  Also, with 40% of the theatrical being Snyder's, that supports the idea that if his Director Cut is 214 mins long, then we have only seen just over 20% of it.",1

"The studio didn’t believe in Zack Snyder’s vision for the characters. After the BVS disaster, many many moviegoers didn’t believe in Zack Snyder’s vision.  I’m one of those people.   But, I do feel sympathy for the people who enjoyed the films and won’t be able to see Snyder’s vision for the universe come to fruition.   I particularly feel bad for Gal Gadot whose character was basically turned into a sex joke in Justice League. I have no doubt that Snyder’s version of the film would have been depressing trash, but I do not believe for a second that he would have allowed WONDER WOMAN to be a comedic object. That bulls*t is all on Whedon.  I don’t believe Affleck truly believed in Snyder’s vision after BVS.  Mamoa is going to go to bat for Snyder all day no matter what because he’s that kind of friend.   Ray Fisher and Ezra were no doubt disappointed in their minimal roles compared to what Snyder had in store for them.  Edit. Also, for the record, I think if DC wanted to do an actual page for page adaption of Frank Miller's Dark Knight, Zack Snyder would be the perfect guy for it, it's his bread and butter. (300, Watchmen)....Just don't let him write anything.",1
Lex Luthor and maybe another one from Batman?,2

Yes. Him and Robert Pattinson are such good actors. I would love to see their characters interact in a future Batman/Joker DC film.,1

There might something really wrong to anyone who's not a Batman fan.,3
We don’t even know what’s the plot,1
"Back in the 90's Nic Cage was on top of the world. This Superman film would have come out right after Face/Off where he displayed great skills playing dual roles, showing he can do a more subdued down to Earth character too. Besides all that's surrounding Burton's film I think Nic Cage's portrayal of Superman would have been great and a positive addition to the character's cinematic history. He would have brought the more alien characteristics to the role, trying to figure out who he is, and where he comes from. A welcome reinvention after Reeve's movies. Too bad it never came to pass.",2
Venom did not outgross either recent Spider-Man movie.,1
That could've been very cool indeed!,1
Sure beats watching nobodies contradicting each other on Twitter. This shit is way more classy.,2
The writing is atrocious and the plot is so damn overused. I almost wish they kept the old design because this movie would be iconically terrible and not just generic and forgettable.,1

They commonly update the Hans-Zimmer.com site with tracklistings and credits of scores, which is considered the go-to source for RCP insider info. Hans Zimmer's personal account is in their official group on Facebook as well as a few other RCP composers. Comes across as hearsay but, as I'm sure anybody who knows what H-Z is can similarly say, they're absolutely legitimate.

If Batman started a war with some old school 90s era international ex-soviet military mobsters.   Creating enemies on a large scale for two decades makes the odds of being found out pretty high.  But like, that’s just my opinion man.",1
Joe and Ray are the ones I feel for most out of the cast. This was supposed to be their gateway to more movies in this universe and more roles in their careers. With Joe being friends with James Gunn I thought he would’ve been included in the new Suicide Squad but there’s been no news on that. Such a shame,3

Those are still in the theatrical cut.,3
"Nope. But WB was disappointed with the final box office and profit of the film. BvS on the other hand should’ve made $1 Billion easy and the box office for that film is inexcusable. From a business prospective, it makes no sense for WB to continue to invest in a Cavill led Superman film when the past 3 didn’t work financially and critically. DC Films (or whatever it’s called) seems to be distancing itself from the “DCEU”  The Batman is a reboot, Cavill as Superman is all but confirmed to be done, and Aquaman and Wonder Woman 1984 moved away from the dark and gritty cynical tone of the past.",1
I am a big fan of the movie and I don't want a sequel.  Turning this one into a franchise feels unnatural.,3
"It could, but their is plenty of ways to spin things. His wife’s death can be viewed as not Superman’s fault because he was trying to stop Zod and he couldn’t save everyone. But if they are just focusing more on how Wally’s life went to hell because of Superman, his wife leaving him instead could in a way make it look worse. And it makes him seem even more bitter, bitter enough to blow up the courtroom.",0

"I kinda saw the last fight with Zod as that. I mean he makes it pretty clear he has nothing left, and even if he killed everyone on Earth, he'd still have nothing. And then there was the thing with the family in the train station, Zod could easily have killed them, he was simply goading Superman into doing it.  As for the notion of 'a good death', they don't explain it in the movie, but it could for all we know be a byword for a Kryptonian soldier accepting that death is an option and that they simply embrace it, meaning they stop being worried or scared of it. The other thing is that it could be something like how it was in Sparta, where you had to die in combat to have died honorably regardless of what you otherwise did in life.  The thing about the fight with Doomsday... I kinda saw that more in the vein of Superman accepting that Doomsday is ultimately a Kryptonian problem and should be solved by Kryptonians (with him being it despite the risks). This ties into another reason why he doesn't pass the spear to Diana or Batman, it's his responsibility Doomsday is put down.",3
My bad. I thought their involvement hinges on Ezra sticking with the role.,1
From what chapter/title specifically,1
"Yes, in general they are. There were also several other sources that I found.",1
That’s actually pretty cool.,3
"I enjoyed more that clip alone than the whole theatrical cut, i would not mind see the original cut even in that state.",1
i saw that as that people want to use superman as excuse to felt warm and comfort while he doing all the hard works,1

"He probably was to some extent, but really hes just another Dan Amboyer trying to get his 5 seconds of fame online. Like the bait clip he posted that was obviously voiced by Ciaran Hinds leading snyder cut enthusiasts to say it was Darkseid.",1
"Yeah, Elfman was brought just for 'NOSTALGIA SUPERMAN BATMAN THEME LOL' and make the film less 'Snydery', Hans and Junkie had composed such beautiful scores for MoS and BvS, that I know in my heart his JL score must be awesome. Elfman is a great composer, but he phoned it even with his Batman Theme, it feels so lifeless and generic, same for William's Superman Theme.",2
I read that Kilmer’s suit was chosen for Bale’s and Battinson’s auditions because it was the one that fit them best out of the options,3
"Oh yeah, I’m not saying it should be Riddler, that was just one of the first villains I thought of that could be done in a similar way.",2
"Snyder has said that people had started to accept that superhero movies have to have post credit scenes so he wanted to do something different. He had the idea of starting each film with a clip of the ending of the previous film from a different point of view. JL was supposed to start with the death of Superman from Lois Lane’s point of view. She watches him pick up the spear and fly away, hears a scream and sees Doomsday die and then she goes running over.",3
I looked it up they are around the same height and considering they’d probably all be in typical professional actor shape they probably all could have fitted into Val Kilmer’s suit.,1
Isaacs as Ras is a solid pick,1
"And why should he be black though if diversity is what they want Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean would be better",2
"That's a trailer Chris, and it was an edit for the final that was used in the movie.  Whedon ruined that shot.",0
"I believe it's going to be a pretty straightforward movie just like the theatrical cut but with more character development , better visuals & better structured plot",2
"Whedan could have said no, he’s just as guilty",3
Was about to say he already nailed it once so more I say!,3
They can make shit up. I can make shit up.,0
I'd watch him play cat woman. Dude can do anything.,2
Deadline news is trustworthy. I don't know why they have far less followers than THR,1
"The biggest reasons would probably be consumer confusion and money.   It could cause confusion among the GA, if you have two versions of JL that are quite different, people might get confused, especially when some people are already confused about what's happening with films like The Batman, etc.   And with money, WB might not want to put more money into a project that they lost money on, especially when a big reason it lost money was due to the hefty reshoots they did to specifically avoid releasing this version. That said, recent rumours suggest that it's mostly complete and that Snyder may have been completing parts in his own time, so if it is ready to go they could easily put it onto HBOMax at a minimal cost.",3
"I doubt WB is going to pivot back to the stage in the DCEU that saw the most rejection, especially now when they're doing much better with a series of hits that only reference previous films.",2
Nothing besides maybe hindering the hype for Pattinson’s Batman. I think the argument of WB not wanting to look bad by releasing it is false. I don’t think studios even care how they look as long as it’s at the expense of a quick buck.,0
Damn I hadn't seen some of these. Cheers.   The one of Supes first flight 2.0 is literally exactly what I hoped for his return. Like shot for shot.  I need that scene.   Hell I just want all of Clark/Supes scenes.,3

Explains how a Rich guy with no powers is able to defeat anyone with just these two words IAM **BATMAN**,1
"Wait hold on, You’re confusing some thing about what I’m saying. Wally’s not agreeing with Lex to make him sound Better, Lex would be MANIPULATING him. Saying, say your wife left you, it will “sound better”. But in reality, it’s just to add to his bitter profile to make him being a Suicide bomber more likely for the media, but Wally wouldn’t know that. He would just trust Lex since he bailed him out and is helping him go against Superman in a way. You took that a whole different way.   Also um, calm down dude? We’re just talking about a theory. I don’t even agree with it. I’m just giving my thoughts.",0
"That literally means nothing. If it's in line then it's even easier to fabricate, cause you'd have little reason to doubt it.",1
"Being rated R isn't the issues, it's that the damn movies need a point otherwise they'll try to be like this other movies where the hero's just make fucking quips and silly jokes in serious moments trying to be funny. That's why JL didn't work (amongst other things)",1
"Perhaps they were fooled that they thought it would work after it kind of worked already (Suicide Squad), financially anyways.",2
Indeed. Snyder’s Superman was gonna evolve into the confident n happy Superman everyone wants the character to be.  Then Lipzarro happened.,2
"Wow. I get that some people are longtime fans of different, more traditional takes on the Man of Steel, but he does realize it's just a movie right? He sounds dreadful to have your own opinions around",2
the thing is he was never the problem. he plays the superman character well and looks the part. the movie writing was usually bad tho,2
It wasn’t his thematic work that was ever in question.  Snyder started in music videos so his visuals are unparalleled.  It’s his misunderstanding of the characters and the story that was an issue for some.,2
"That's what I thought he meant. But why does he fear conflict to begin with?  Edit: Wow, what is wrong with you guys?",0
That's not an issue. Patrick Wilson voiced POTUS in BVS and also played Ocean Master and Djimon Hounsou played The Wizard in Shazam and King Ricou in Aquaman.,3
"It’s called studio interference, the final design with what we ended up with is awful with regards to what they wanted to originally achieve which was to make a badass looking scary ‘creature’",3
Any comic written by Scott Snyder is worth a read for me.,1
"That's a whole lotta false equivalency and assuming shit on your part. No matter what I say, you'll continue believing it. I'm neither gonna waste my time nor energy for nothing.  If you believe Watchmen was hated before and is universally loved now, or that Donner had a similar reaction to MoS or BvS, you're living in an alternate reality.",1
This isn't that far fetched. Remember Age of Ultron?,3
"Bale's BEGINS physique was on point. Especially in the training montage. Also, because of his suit and cowl design, his neck looked thick and made him look formidable as Batman even though he couldn't turn his neck.  TDK and TDKR suit might have made him agile and granted him flexibility, the same made him look leaner than BATMAN should be. Let's not talk about the amount of armor plating on that suit :-/",2
I don’t think it’s Riddler since Reeves has dibs on the character for now.,3
"I don't wanna create a false rumor, it's been almost half a year since I was told about this so I don't remember exactly how they described it, but Ramesh tried to do a mockup of it: [https://twitter.com/RameshDeSilva2/status/1143509228092477443](https://twitter.com/RameshDeSilva2/status/1143509228092477443)[/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzIl0W_A7Sn/) Don't worry, we'll get to see it eventually at some point.",2

">in a really big universe   Thats the issue. The universe is so large that the Kryptonians should have come across another earth-like planet in their space travels, where they have superpowers.",1
There is no con.  Allegedly it’s the idea that showing the Snyder Cut will somehow cause mass confusion (and hysteria) by creating a second continuity.  An idea that is beyond laughably stupid.,0
Isn't The Batman suit going to be revealed too?,1
Directors do that a ton tho,1

"Is it really? I feel like I NEVER see people praising it. I love 3D (when it’s done well), but I literally don’t ever see anyone say anything good about it.",2
Lol no. I saw the same thing,1
"Henry addressed his feelings on a Snyder cut last year, before he started production on the Witcher.

"No!!!!!  Seriously, people saying “oh man it would’ve been great in a weird way!” are just trying to be funny or ironic or whatever.   Superman Lives would’ve been a fucking disaster.",1
"1. No, Supes was supposed to be more optimistic in JL 1 and 2 ALWAYS. JL3 would have a brainwashed Supes for only a little bit. And even Snyder admitted the original plan was crazy.   2. Under Snyder and Terrio, by their words, JL was always going to be more optimistic. Original and new plan. The difference is that while it was optimistic, it was still serious and complex. Johns was obsessed with wanting it to be more humorous. That's why they reshot 70% of the movie with Joss. Just look at the early Snyder JL trailers. They're still optimistic and more triumphant. More Wonder Woman-esque. But not as comedic as Whedon's garbage reshoots.   3. Snyder's movies aren't always the same dude. Watchmen was cynical and satirical on humanity and superheroes. BvS reached a more positive conclusion (""Men are still good"").   4. Do you not know the hero's journey? It starts conflicted, moves to a dark sacrifice, and emerges with hope. That's literally the arc Snyder was going for, a classical hero's journey. Which also influenced Post-Crisis Superman heavily.   5. Keep believing whatever you feel like and I'll go off of what we know for a fact from the SC plot.",1

Waste of talent.,1
"Vast majority is a strong, non-quantifiable take. JL certainly didn't light up the box office. As Cavill says, it didn't work. We can discuss this all day, but it isn't a science. MoS killed the audience! BvS does well. BvS killed the audience! SS does well. SS killed the audience! WW does well. All I ask as a fan and for the fanbase is to be recognized as a viable opinion that matters. Analyzing that the general audience likes jokes and jokes will make a billion dollars is what has led WB to have this open wound in what they did to JL where their biggest stars Jason Momoa and Gal Gadot are telling people WB fucked up.   Cavill stands by MoS and that's good enough for me.",1

I suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and thinking about the world-building in the DCEU chiefly by Zack Snyder makes me happy and helps me escape and cope with life. Find your passion, follow your bliss.",2
Is this confirmed?,1
No way. I'd actually be shocked if they did.,1
You’re laughing because of a statistic? Do you often laugh at facts or is this a one-off?,1
Cinematography is really beautiful.   The underwater scenes.  Volcano Ring fight.  Final battle. Arthur vs Orm fight Trench scene. Surface action sequences.  I thought Aquaman would make around 700-800 mil in box office given how low opinion DCEU was having during that time. But the visual spectacle really added alot to the theatrical experience.,2
Source please.  Every breakdown I’ve seen shows that it depends on the movie and no it is not that extreme.  Maybe 65% for the studio in the first 4 weeks for a high end Disney blockbuster and then it gradually tapers to the 50/50 cut afterwards.  But most movies do not have the leverage to cut the theater owners out of the equation for the most lucrative portion of any movie’s run.,1

I was going off the impression I have of most actors having no idea what to make of the film until it's released beyond empty contractual spiel intended to fill seats.

"Wow, you're right. Another day, and we're one day closer to the SnyderCut.",3
It’s not perfect but Joker does face off against a fledgling Dark Knight in the Gotham TV show.  Joker is quite good in that show,1

"It was at its peak when Man of Steel came out. Fans came out of the woodwork saying “That’s not my Superman! Bah humbug!” And I LOVED Man Of Steel.  I love Mark Waid as a writer but even I was embarrassed when he wrote that manifesto saying he was screaming “Don’t do it!” In the theater at the end of the final battle in MOS and how the movie “got Superman wrong.”  I would never begrudge a comic fan of their ideal version of Superman. My personal favorite iterations are John Byrnes’ version, Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness, and Geoff Johns and Gary Frank’s. But if someone loves the All-Star Superman version, or even Brian Michael Bendis’s version, I’d never Tell’em “That’s not the REAL Superman!”",3

Just too much, if the rest of the universe looked the same, that’s fine but it’s way too far from everything else!",2

I'm really sorry his kid died truly i am, i would have been more pissed if he wasn't paid for BVS OR JL.  But he was, i dont really see him as a victim, he is a millionaire for fuck sake. If he really want to fulfill his ""VISION"".  He could release a series of comics on his 5 part movie arc he had planned. Its really fucking simple. WB is a business and DC belongs to WB. DC doesn't belong to Zack Snyder. He was hired to do a job, his bosses felt he wasn't good enough and he was fired simple!!. It happens everyday, that is the nature of capitalism.",0

"Decent people also don't take advantage of friendships, but you do you. Oh the irony of your thought process. So caving on this sets a bad precedent, but the whole reason JL was even changed was because they caved to social media pressure. But again, you do you. Other VFX artists have said it was close to completion, Momoa has implied it's  completed. Many have come out and said they have seen it.  If you look at the timeline and know even a little about how movies are made it's pretty obvious it would be alot more than an assembly cut. More than likely minimal vfx left to be done. But again you can believe w.e you wish. They have incentive to release as it shows good will towards fans and it would help to draw people to HBOmax. How do you know it was the same sources when they are anonymous? That's a weird leap. It's also weird to assume I didn't believe Ben was gone. I knew it as soon as I saw JL because I knew that wasn't what he signed up for. How do I know? Because he literally said the reason he choose to do Batman and it was because of snyders story.  You can belive as you wish just as I can. People like you are weird though, spend an inordinate amount of time on something you don't care about. Honestly it's fucking strange, I will never understand people like yourself. Who focuses on the things they hate? That's just counter productive",1
"Let’s talk about how fantastic tonight’s episode of The Flash was, then.",2
Comparing him to Nolan is so unfair. Comparing 98% of filmmakers to Nolan is unfair.,2
"Because he had to make a two-hour movie, not a minute longer. And JL had less solo movie prequels than The Avengers did. JL needed more buildup and character work. There wasn’t room for a lot of Darkseid in only two hours. He only teased Thanos in The Avengers, but there was already the beginnings of a plan to deliver on that promise. Whedon probably didn’t want to hurt fans with what he knew would’ve been an empty promise. He could probably tell that he was making a movie that wasn’t gonna be anywhere near as good as The Avengers. I want the Snyder cut, but the released version is not the Whedon cut. It’s the WB cut",2
"I'd know why, but I just can't help this feeling that he doesn't really care that much about Shazam...",3
Cavill and Johnson have the same people making their careers happen. If DJ is a big part of DC moving forward I could see the two both being involved. Hell maybe Johnson will throw his weight around and say that they need to wrap up Cavill's contract and play nice or he walks after the one movie.,3

"I mean, we're talking about Harley Quinn, here. Her fashion sense is... quirky. I guess a guy would just wear the watch normally; Harley's made them into bracelets.  For Joker and Harley in this movie, they took a lot of inspiration from real life Mexican cartel leaders and their gangs. Here's a quote from the costume designer:  >What kind of real-world research did you do, outside of referencing the comics? > >*We spent a lot of time looking up drug cartel auction websites, and Mexican drug lords were doing a lot on Instagram at that time. All of the guns and accessories very much came from that world.* > >How did that inspire you specifically? > >*There’s just such excess in this underground world, you wouldn’t believe the reality of some of it. There’s even a female gangster who had a pink machine gun. It’s kind of suburban, weirdly, but taken to extremes. I was at Warner Bros. working while the Mexican government was auctioning off all their Rolexes and guns and shit like that. And I said, “I have to bid on that!”  And of course Warner Bros. blocked me from bidding on any of it. So we made it instead.*    I'd guess the watches are like a status symbol thing, for intimidation or whatever - ""See how many gangsters I've whacked? You could be next, puddin'!""  There's a scene in the novelization of the film where Captain Boomerang steals a Rolex off one of Enchantress's minions after their first encounter with them (remember how they were all regular people who'd been transformed by her magic) and Harley asks if she can have it to add to her collection.",3

"These things work together yes, which is why you have *a separate category for the picture as a whole*, and then you look at the individual elements to see if that deserves recognition as well in their respective categories, and in this case the script doesn’t. It is not uncommon to nominate a film for best picture but not for some of the other sub categories. People often get surprised to see best picture nominated movies that didn’t get all these sub category nominations, but the reason is that the sum can be greater than its parts. The separate nominations are for the parts.  It’s a good initial idea/pitch (joker origin as socio-realistic portrait of the derailment of a mentally ill person done like early Scorsese) but the script isn’t  really expanding this idea and doing interesting things with it, neither in dialogue, themes nor events happening in the movie. Only a few heavy handed references to “rich vs poor” hint at what the movie could have done a lot of interesting things with if a proper script had fleshed these ideas out a little.  The best things in this movie is largely to Phoenix credit: an amazing acting performance, portrayal of a mentally ill man with mannerism.  The dancing sequences in the bathroom and on the stairs were improvised, - Neither Phillips not the script knew what to do when they were filming those scenes, and so Phoenix just started dancing. And the talk show with Murray largely was too.  I’m arguing if you didn’t have that performance you’d see how barebones the script really is. Phoenix is making the screenplay look better than it is. Beyond the amazing performance, the character of Arthur really isn’t written all that interesting. He’s not supposed to be funny, I get that, but then at least give him *some* other characteristic that makes him compelling other than his mental disability. I’d argue the dancing is probably more or less the only thing that makes you go “huh what is that about, that’s interesting”.  Ledger’s Joker isn’t all that *funny* either, yes he cracks some jokes here and there, but it’s really his world view, his philosophical outlook and desire to mess with the status quo, *whatever* that may be that makes him truly compelling - oh yeah, that and his complete unpredictability. All of *that* comes from the script, which of course also was brought to life by a stellar performance.  Imagine if the talk show scene actually had *good* dialogue, what you could do with DeNiro and Phoenix building on that, but instead you get an interview that doesn’t really go anywhere but a heavy handed “joke” that serves you the one and only theme of the movie on a silver platter.  Again I’m not taking anything away from Phoenix and his performance, because that’s really what makes this movie. But just imagine what could have been with an actually good script. Phoenix was great, the production design was great, the makeup was great. I’d have loved to see that with good dialogue and subtext.",1

"Yeah, I don't blame Whedon personally, but I'm still shocked that a respected director would do that to another professional. It's not like Whedon is wanting for work.   I suspect he did it to open up future opportunities, but it's ironic that one of his recent tweets started with ""F*#@ing sell-out"", about someone else.  Ideally everyone who'd accepted the job would have gone ""yeah, I'll do what you claim is happening and respect his vision, but I'm not gonna stab the dude in the back for you"".",1
"Bvs made a profit too. Also I have hears more people make fun of Aquaman the movie more than BvS. The movie was extremely mixed but was still successful. Same with BvS. Aquaman was the 6th in the series of DCEU movies, so that's what led it to being a bigger boom.",1
"Not explicitly no, but an adopted black kid raised in rural Kansas would have a very, very different upbringing and would definitely experience the worst sides of humanity on a personal level as a child, which reasonably would mean that *that* Clark would be a very different person.   I’m fine with him as Kal-El, but then I’d prefer if they’d use Calvin Ellis instead. Would give them much more freedom to sculpt exactly the kind of Superman they want as well.",2
I just wanted to see it all in context and we never got to see the entire story play out. BVS got so much hate but they still had so many more movies to go to finish the story. It would be like only seeing Empire Strikes back and hating the story. Or only two towers.  We didn't know where it was all going.  I just wish we had Snyder's full vision from MoS to the end of the JL sequels before we all jumped on the judgement bandwagon. In context these movies may have made a much better impact in hindsight.,2

"Basically his plan was to create a new language to be spoken underwater.    Problem is that they already established Atlantean language many times in the comics and in the Young Justice Tv Show.  It would have been cool for him to spawn a new language.  But I think it would have been weird?  Could have sounded fine as a final product.  But it would suck for anyone making an entire Aquaman film, where he was just going to spend a small segment of time in Atlantis, but they had to be there for around an hour.",1

">As we all know, on IMDb the April 3, 2020 slot that was once listed for Cyborg is now displayed as ""unknown DC Film"" with its status is described as ""completed."" If WB goes full open throttle with this and the Snyder cut gets a theater release, it would roughly correspond to launch of HBO Max. The pitch for HBO Max subscribers would be that you'll get this on streaming after the theater run, and exclusively at HBO Max, etc.  Didn't Snyder say Cyborg was the heart of JL in his version? If we get the Snyder cut in April then It will be a Cyborg movie in a way.",1

Those the video surveillance was concrete evidence,3
"I agree. It was a work of art and you cheapen it by making a sequel you had not originally planned to do.   Now if they want to do another hero or villain in that same universe and have Easter eggs back to Joker, fine. But leave the character as he is, don’t cheapen it.",1

There are crazy story possibilities with Vandal Savage. It might be one of the very few DC villains they could actually make 5 films on.,3
WB won't pay Cavill what they pay Dwayne..,1
damn Aquaman was such a bad movie i had no idea it made that much but I guess it's almost impossible for super hero movies not to hit a billion or come damn close.,0

"Fuck Geoff Johns. Just because he's a great comic writer should have him stay in his lane. I bet he's the reason Affleck left and Rick Famuyiwa's topical Flash film was canned. And if he's that good of a writer who lives and breaths DC, why is his writing on Justice League such garbage?",0
Really hate the aesthetic of this movie,3
">I'm way more of an empathetic human being since I understand the fact that people have other opinions.  I am more than aware that people have different opinions, but where we differ is that I'm not under some childish illusion that opinions need to be respected and that they can't be wrong.   Again, opinions can be wrong, the opinion that the earth is flat is wrong, the opinion that vaccines cause autism is wrong, and your opinion on positive representation not being helpful is wrong.   >You should try to understand that sometime.  You should understand that opinions can be wrong and that denying clear and overwhelming evidence is irrational.   >And no I am saying that by you resorting to childish memes negates your ability to function on a debate level as an adult.  And you telling me to fuck off earlier doesn't make you childish? You literally pulled the ""I'm older that you so I know better"", that's the most boomer attitude you can have.   Why does using an applicable meme make me a bad debater. Bad debating would be be saying your points are wrong *because* you are a boomer.  I'd be a bad debater if I threw a hissy fit because I got called a word I didn't like.  >The debate is over and you lost.   Yes, because the party that storms off after denying reality for lofty emotional reasons is the party that won.   Seriously, I really hope you actually do some research as you really sound like a bit of a closeted bigot.",0
"I'd rather he play the monitor or Namu. Someone with authority but who can potentially work in a comedic scene, if only as a straight man. Darkseid can never be funny.  I've always felt that Darkseid, being effectively the space devil, needs to have an almost seductive quality to his voice. Not really in a sexual way, but he need to have a certain charisma that is more important than gravitas.  That's why Michael Ironside worked so damn well. His voice isn't the deepest (in fact in the original airing of superman TAS they pitched him down in post, but then reversed it because his natural higher voice worked better) but he had charisma. He is saying and doing terrible things, but part of you WANTS to see him do it.  My pick for a live action darkseid is Bryan Cranston. With Avery Brooks as a close second.",2
This is no longer true for China.  They certainly love their spectacle but it is not the only qualifier for success there.  There have been plenty of big budget films that have done mediocre to flat out flopped there.  Even including the token asian characters is not a key to success there.  Broadly appealing storytelling does seem to be a more common tie with success and having spectacle to enhance the experience is a plus.,2
AAAAA Looks so goooood!!!,3
I want man of steel 2 to have bizzaro in it,1
"How was Snyder the problem? Look at the first Justice League trailer, look at what he planned with the second Justice League movie and everything, it would have been so amazing.   Instead we got Whedon being ordered by some higher ups to change 80 PAGES of the movie, where roughly 1 page equals to 1 minute.   The movie was supposed to be like 3 hours long and WB forced them to shorten it to under 2 hours.  Just imagine if you removed an entire HOUR of footage from Avengers Endgame, the movie would suck absolute dick",2

"What gets me is that you can clearly tell he knows who both of them are when they meet at the party, but people point to THIS moment in surprise that he knows who they are.   I mean, he basically invited batman to come steal his files and kryptonite in order to facilitate the fight. Do people not understand that 100% of that movie (up till the big fight) was Lex Luthor setting up the fight everyone came to the theater to see? How is ANYONE that's ever seen it surprised that Lex knows who they both are?",2

"Why wouldn’t the core character be the same? Why can’t that be powerful? You don’t think that it would be incredible for hundreds of thousands of kids to see Superman portrayed in that way. I wouldn’t call it table scraps.   Superman is a unique character in this discussion because he’s an alien from another world, he’s not only a white American or an African American.   I personally would choose Cavill if I had my choice though.",0
"gddmn that would have immediately pulled you in. The entire tone of the movie changes. That's some serious shit, filled with myth and lore. Your mindset just expands tenfold.  Look I feel bad but I'll be honest, I feel worse for DC comic book ~~fans~~ lifers. You guys might have to wait a decade for JJ Abrams to give you hardcore JL lore.",2
Steppenwolf literally just mentioned they were too weak to see the truth.  I'm also unsure of how much Superman would approach his OG counterpart for reasons I've mentioned somewhere else in the comments,1
He probably doesn’t run his social media. Most of his posts are staged marketing type posts and not “I have my phone here’s what’s up” posts and if he’s negotiating with WB why help them? The ones under WB probably got the nod from handlers and the studio for the free publicity,1

If he tells you, “don’t worry about it”, more than likely that means he’s got you covered. We’re talking about the smartest man in the world here.  Where does it say that Wallace hates Bruce? He never mentions Bruce after the opening scene.",1

Not sure what you mean by the title. You cant create resolution that doesnt exist.   Do you mean you photoshopped a body on to his headshot to make an image from a wider angle?,2
"It's not just about when superheroes are placed in a bleak world, but also when the movie acknowledges something *uncomfortable* about them.   TDKT is about as real as it gets in the world, but no one cared when Batman killed in those movies because the movies themselves *pretend* otherwise/refused to acknowlege it. Be it the entire league of shadows in BB, Dent, Talia, Talia's driver, or even Ra's himself.  The MCU is a master at this; they will selectively acknowledge important things but never pushes the audience to be uncomfortable with the flipside. Dr Strange had a throwaway line about how he will not kill again because he's a doctor, but that's never brought up again when he battles faceless goons. Black Panther pulls real world parallels for Kilmonger but ignores any for T'Challa (ie if Wakanda exists in real life, it would probably be the US's #1 threat the moment its borders are open. Also, his endeavor in Korea meant nothing).",3
Gal is just on another level of sexiness in WW costume.,3
"I never got the passion for this pairing in a romantic way. Whats wrong with them being friends?!

Nah Henry Cavill is my Superman! I did see an idea for Winston Duke to play the loveable dorky Superman and it'd focus on a lot of him and Lois working the Daily Bugle and fighting crimes together and I love the idea! Winston Duke would be awesome!,2
"My bad, I definitely agree with you, but showing the meta human files was a good nod to the symbols and the characters to come. I feel like BvS was very secluded, just its own movie, as you said.   But as for JL, It is too fused together. I feel like after BvS, they should have introduced us to Aquaman and Flash with their solo movies, with Cyborg being introduced as the heart and soul of JL as Cyborg's armor and Steppenwolf's armor are the same thing (the armor of Steppenwolf in the concept arts looks very similar to Cyborg's armor, so there could have been some lore there).",1
"Do you know what the ""S"" stands for?",1
Stop teasing us like this and release the Ayer Cut.,1
Hugh Laurie as Doctor Fate? That’d be a good casting imo.,2
I'd prefer Domnhall Gleeson for Scarecrow,3
If we’re going to race bend I’d prefer someone like Henry Golding. I just don’t think Michael b jordan is that great of an actor,0
I don't see why there's so much hate over MoS. It is extremely underrated and easily one of the best superhero movies. Much better than most Marvel movies tbh.,2
It was such a blast! I hope the second one is even better!,1
FUCK  my hype level just exploded,1
The S means hope. We should have some.,3
"Hope Supes next suit doesn’t have those stupid looking muscles built into them, or at least make them more natural and subtle looking.",1
I think it made around 8.75 + milllion dollars from India.  The word of mouth was really strong here.  Alot of fans who were blown away by Heath Ledger's performance as Joker went into theatre and came out with amazement.  Alot of theatres were added on the 2nd weekend after the reviews started pouring in.,2
84 also allegedly is a disaster and turning out to be awful just like the first WW movie *allegedly* was.  So I don't care about anything ALLEGEDLY being reported before a movie comes out.,1

You can literally go put your face in the bath tub and try talking. Let us know if it sounds like you do when you talk normally.    In any event, it’s just down to preference.  Snyder didn’t like it, Wan was OK with it. Doesn’t make one an asshole idiot or the other a genius.  Unless one wants to work in their personal biases.",1
Looks like NN November is over for me. Sad.,2
"Personally, I'm gonna keep calling these movies ""DC Elseworlds"" and refuse to stop. DC Black doesn't really make sense as a franchise label, it's too restricting.",3

Looks great. Trunks are gonna be a tough sell though.,2
"He had the whole vision planned out. Someone asked him if things had gone different would we have gotten Flashpoint and he replied ""Better"".",2
"From what I understand it's no more a cliffhanger than just knowing Darkseid is out there and now knows about the League. So kinda like Thanos when he said 'I'll do it myself"" in the MCU.  I can live with that. Though I'm hoping this film does incredibly well and someone at WB suggests putting Zack on another DCEU movie.",3
Please give us a glimpse of Vandal Savage too.,1
Is this a harry potter sub? Nah bro this is a dc sub,0
"That's not how it works chief.  Every dollar made at a theater gets split between the theaters and the studio/distributers.  In the US that split is rougly around 50/50 but some studios (i.e. Disney) can have the content to muscle a 60/40 split.  In China that split is much worse for the studio - they only get roughly a quarter of that take because the money is also split with theaters and the chinese distributers.  The marketing cost is a real thing, but the tax liability is often different for the studio than it is for direct income off the movie production (because of the external partners involved).  So including marketing, any given movie needs to make approximately 2.5-3x its production budget in order to break even.  JL barely broke 2x and lost money (roughly a $60M loss).",2
"What the heck, why would there be a FAKE Jimmy Olsen. He should have just been some other guy.",2

"I don’t understand why in a movie where all the other characters are colored so the pop off the screen, including the CGI Parademons, Steppenwolf’s main color scheme was gray/silver. What’s wrong with making him black and red like the comics?",2
I wanna see Johnny Depp as the riddler,1
The calls for the #snydercut actually ask for it to be an HBO Max release. I imagine Netflix would not want for the star of their biggest show this year to come in support of some other media premiering t o a rival streaming platform.,1
"I literally have no idea what your purpose is here.   Is it that mark is just recycling old shit?  Is it that he is wrong in some way?   Honestly.  If Zack was able to ""confirm"" anything he would have, the story would have been set straight years ago.  But he can't so he hasn't.  Not officially anyways.  And that is my point  Again the point is Mark now has more insider knowledge than others.     The point is to make this narrative the only narrative.   No more articles about an assembly cut or a cut that never got filmed or finished. What arent you getting about this?",2
Say it for the people in the back!,1

"In the original JL plan (Which was abandoned early on and even Snyder says it was too crazy), JL2 would've ended with Darkseid killing Lois and subjecting Supes to the Anti-Life Equation. Supes would've been held under that for a small part of JL3 most likely.",1
"What have you done here, Steppenwolf?",1
I’d love that. Was a huge fan of MoS.,1
"Interesting, Zack’s there but Joss did the scene in the movie, must have been another reshoot I guess",1
"Gotta disagree with the herd here. There is a reason those cuts were made. More screen times for these fan boy's favorite characters might please them, but did not make for a better movie in any way. The UC's pacing is off, an IMHO is only worth watching if you enjoyed the original and want more. If you didn't enjoy what you got in the original the extra content in the UC is not going to help.",0
"I agree.   If they want to dump Cavill because they really want to separate themselves from Snyder, it doesn't make sense to keep Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller and Jason Momoa.  That's a direct contradiction of their own decision.   It makes even less sense since...  A) Cavill wants to keep going,  B) We (at least most of us) want him to keep going.  Cavill is great for the role; same for Momoa and Gadot. I haven't seen enough of Miller to feel strongly one way or the other about him.  Whatever Snyder's faults may have been, he made pretty solid casting decisions.",2
Keanu Reeves as Dr Fate was my personal choice for years.,3

HOWEVER  If WB really doesn't want to have anything to do with the Snyder Cut, wouldn't they advise their social media teams NOT TO interact with the SC movement whatsoever? Especially after the biggest social media event involving it just happened?",3
They did a fantastic job.,2
I’d love it,1
He’s actually said he wants a superhero role too (not a Nick Fury or Alfred type but an actual hero) but no one has offered him anything. Jay Garrick would be so perfect for him.,3
"I think the problem is that Nic Cage can’t do insecure Clark Kent, he would just do Nic Cage, he can’t play strong without being larger than life either, and Superman needs to be a hero for the people and be down to earth. Joe is similar but in that movie he was super dry, Superman needs to be a beam of positivity ya know.  Michael Keaton’s Bruce worked as a rich guy who is content with his life and enjoys his romantic life, that worked for the material he was given. I don’t personally think many styles would allow that iteration to work quite as good, yet for some reason I’m now thinking the way he played Bruce is so much better than the movies themselves.",0
">The fact that he's unreliable at any point makes me question what he says about himself   He's only possibly unreliable in that one instance as Batman if you believe he killed Joker, because he might have actually killed someone and his subconscious is trying to find a way out of it, but in that instance it is made quite clear that he's slightly fabricating events, as Jokers speech bubbles become like his own and he talks to the Jokers corpse as if it's laughing at him, miller is communicating that to readers. With the mutant there is literally nothing to suggest that batman did kill them and is convincing himself otherwise, if batman killing the mutant was Miller's intention, he would have made it clear. Instead miller has Batman 12 pages later explicitly say that he hasn't crossed the line he drew for himself, he hasn't killed anyone, Miller is making it clear he didn't kill anyone, including the mutant.   >The cops would have hundreds of cases to sift through for charges.   If someone was shot with a gun and killed at that case I'd find it very hard that they'd overlook it and levy ""causing a public hazard"" instead, especially with a new Commissioner who's making her opening address to specifically demonise Batman and that this case was a high priority case.  >It'd be real easy to overlook/dismiss one case where it looks like two criminals shot each other with machine guns.   You're forgetting this was a hostage situation with a child who's the heir to a business and fortune, something the media and the police are already *very* closely monitoring and something they likely knew batman had involved himself with as he rescued the child.   This wouldn't have been lost in mountains of paperwork, it was an ongoing investigation and a high priority case. If they had any reason to believe that batman killed the mutant, they would have plastered it across the TV, but all Yindel seems to think is important is assult, breaking and entering and creating a public hazard.  >And Batman absolutely shot that Mutant. At that range, with that gun, that Mutant is dead.  Batman is one of the most skilled marksman in the world, if he wanted to only maim them, he would have and evidently did. There's no entrywound on the body, nobody brings it up afterwards, the police commissioner who's first act as commissioner is to arrest batman didn't think it was important etc.   It looks like he might have killed them out of context sure, but the book makes it pretty clear he didn't kill them.",1
"Thanks for this, everything sounds very promising and it seems like Aalter Hamada is the savior of DC Films. The genius behind the scenes.",3
"I think Keanu should play every role in the movie that isn't Black Adam, even Teth Adam can be Keanu.",1
True I still think the first Bane fight is the best Batman fight ever. The story the atmosphere the dialogue gave me a sense of dread for Batman that no other movie has achieved.,1
"That sounds like a good analogy. But there's more. The newer films don a different aesthetic. Compare the underwater scenes in JL to AM. You go from textured/clouded to clear/vibrant. The underwater physics go from more resistance to less resistance. The vibrant modern look isn't just about in-universe uniforms. In the next WW film Diana is about to wear the American flag. It's gone from antique brass to orange to red.  So, there are several things going on here.",2
"In my mind it'd require negligible $ from WB to make the Snyder Cut itself profitable (Tho I'm 100% talking out my ass here). But yea, you make a good point with digital vs physical dvds",1
[He definitely does](https://i.redd.it/n3pq7cd0fhx31.jpg),1
Still doesn't change the fact that he and his company variety have been wrong on numerous things before. It again we don't know The Insider he's talk to. The Insider could just be some low-level schmuck was just telling him information discussions that have been had. Plus also a lot of information that Crowell was talking about in his article today or things that a we already know or B things we had known way before or C things that he clearly didn't even bother to mention like for example Shazam and Black Adam and barely even mentioning Wonder Woman 1984. Has a lot of information that had been changed since then and he didn't even bother to mention those things. Plus JJ Abrams also has confirmed that they haven't had discussions about Superman yet but he goes and says that they are talking about Superman. So this guy's either getting very mixed information or he's talking about all the information that was given to him prior to his articles release.,3
Yep. Cavill deserved so much better.,0
Right... so if you aren’t Atlantean this still doesn’t apply to you lol,2
"To be fair they’ve used Snyder shots for promos all along, including stuff never in the movie.",1
What if I told you another cut of that film existed...,1
"Oh yea. Unfortunately for DC Cinematic, it is gonna be terrible. Which is a shame considering they have been boomin' for the last 3.",2
"Fair point about Infinity War. It felt more like a gigantic Marvel Universe movie, rather than an Avengers movie. Like you said, it featured nearly every established character in the MCU film franchise up to that point.  And I also agree about it not being Whedon's call to make the drastic changes. That was clearly on WB. If Whedon had been given more time to write his on movie, I'm sure he would have come up with something much better than what we got. Instead we got a rushed mess that wasn't representative of *anyone's* true vision.",2
I think it’s pretty obvious this movie is made for a certain type of demographics. I get it and I hope it works out for WB.,2

But even then, Batman is only **one** movie of the **7 they have slated**, and by this time next year, that could be 10+ that aren't Batman/Superman.  Aquaman, WW, and Shazam are getting sequels. BoP is doing it's part with introducing new characters. SS is introducing more obscure characters and I believe Gunn will stick around with DC after filming GotG3; more obscurities and deep cuts would likely come with that. Black Adam is getting a movie that could spark more solos with JSA members being introduced. The Flash, New Gods, Batgirl, Plastic Man (Bill Hader pls!), Blue Beetle, etc are being worked.  I get what you mean, but patience is a virtue. DC Films were getting shat on just for existing like 2 years ago. Lol  They're taking it slow, focusing on distinction, and not necessarily worrying about over-connectivity. We as fans will have to be patient.",1
"Which is the only reason I feel confident in this sequel. I didn’t think anyone would be able to get Phoenix to play a comic book role, but they did it. If the story for the sequel is good enough to get Phoenix on board then I will be very excited for this.",2
Would they please stop fucking around and just give us this god damn movie?!,2
he can get DiCaprio?,1
"Would you say that for the New Gods in general, or just Steppenwolf?",1
"Snyder literally said it's done a cut exists. He said this on video that is free to watch on line.  So at MOST, it needs some post-production VFX work. But the film is already shot, cut, and scored.",1

"TIL theres an age limit on being a ""superhero character""",2
"Why is this even a discussion again? It was a last year's rumor that led to nothing. And also, if I remember correctly, MBJ said he does not want to play the character. In my opinion it does not make sense to make Superman black, while there are characters like John Stewart or Cyborg in the DC world.",1

I would just do it they way we are doing things right now. Get creators to work on different characters. Its worked well so far. I'd rather not have the Kevin Feige model,1

Yet it's happened.,0
It physically pains me to see it too.,2
Snyder is the GOAT. Should’ve let him continue his work in DC. Guaranteed it was going to be very very very successful.   #RELEASETHESNYDERCUT  /s  Jokes aside... would want to see his JL cut. 100 percent couldn’t be worse than the TC.,1
HJ in the show looks like a wimp compared to the 2009 version IMO haha,0
Even digital released still require more works unless they let it out raw.  And how embarassing HBO Max look if one of their selling points is a re-edited of flopped film back in 2017 while Disney Plus or Netflix got tons of new original contents.,1
Yep. Momoa and Ray tweeting on Sunday nov 17th wouldn't have changed anything. We were expecting that bcz both were vocal supporters of SC. ( I believe Momoa and Ray personally handle their IG/Twitter )  But tweets from Gal and Affleck changed everything. No one was expecting that. And both of them might have PR teams who were advised by them to go put out this tweet.   Something's happening man.. :),2
"Political thriller, most likely. Think All the Presidents Men, except if Nixon was even more unhinged.",1
not bigger then Spiderman.,1
"“Someone says to me, ‘Batman killed a guy.’ I’m like, ‘f*ck, really? Wake the f*ck up,'” explained Snyder. “I guess that’s what I’m saying. Once you’ve lost your virginity to this f*cking movie and then you come and say to me something about like, ‘My superhero wouldn’t do that.’ I’m like, ‘Are you serious?’ I’m like down the f*cking road on that.”  He continued, “It’s a cool point of view to be like, ‘My heroes are still innocent. My heroes didn’t fucking lie to America. My heroes didn’t embezzle money from their corporations. My heroes didn’t fucking commit any atrocities.’ That’s cool. But you’re living in a fucking dream world.”",1
Bad luck buddy.. the left girl is playing huntress,2
Closer to Namor I'd say,1
I remember seeing he and Jared Leto in the original list of actors on IMDb,1
He does when the divorce papers require it.,3
Snyder has never put compelling character development on screen,1
They did Zack and the entire fanbase dirty with what they released. Dumb execs,2
Bummed about Suicide Squad being R.  That means DC won’t beat Marvel at the box office for 2021 :/,0
"I mean, I highly doubt any studio has ever said ""We got a box-office bomb on our hands""",3

"No he didn’t. Geoff loves and knows DC more than anyone and has done more for DC as a brand than Snyder has. DC is all about heart, heroics, and hope. That’s DC comics. Snyder literally read The Dark Knight Returns- which is super cynical and Injustice which is even more cynical and went “cool let’s make that a movie”. Snyder’s BvS turned off generations of Batman and Superman fans and made DC look like a joke. Please, and I ask respectfully read some more DC comics other than Elseworld stories to get a feel for why DC is supposed to be like.   “Ares a video game villain” like Zod and Doomsday?  Snyderverse fans are usually (not always) not comic readers and only began “liking” Superman from MoS and BvS and think he should be mopey and sad and not talk.",2
"Well, at least there’s comfort knowing that he actually really cares about the character and wants it done right. Class act, that Henry Cavill. Can’t wait for the Witcher series to come out as well, looks badass!",1
I love the BVS/JL version.,3
"I’ve heard that as well. I think it’s safe to say none of us really know what that’s going to entail or look like. I also don’t think that it means Leto is safe, his recent reaction to *The Joker* (to me) seemed to express that he didn’t feel he had a stable future at DC.  My point was I don’t think that this version of the Joker and Harley have become as iconic of a duo as you do, we are free to disagree, but truly Leto was hardly in Suicide Squad, and most of the feedback I see about the movie is lousy. The original comment was that there is no way WB could recast a Joker with this Harley (Margot). I disagree, I think it could be done pretty easily.",1

"300??? Really??? 300 is a legendary and iconic movie? 😂😂😂  Watchmen was almost frame by frame out of the comic book, even then he threw some supernatural fighting in there which wasn't comic book accurate. So Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore are the ones to thank for Watchmen.",0
"There's plenty of small scale stories that can be told and have been told by using Superman. And I'm not just talking about the 80s. Plenty of modern comics feature such moments as well.  Just a small wholesome moment in a movie doesn't necessarily imply that he's purposely letting millions of people die in terrorist attacks.  These are fictional stories featuring fictional characters. If the writer says that Superman helped a civilian with a small thing AND managed to reach a bigger problem without delay, then I don't see any reason to not believe him. We're talking about a guy who can fly and has super speed. Pretending that he is capable of managing such a feat isn't impossible or unrealistic.",1
"I mean, we still haven’t really gotten a proper classic adaptation of the Joker.",2
Don't think so.,2

But we don’t know when Wallace stopped getting those checks. Lex said “little red notes” in plural form. Which he more than likely wrote the words on the checks. The fact that Bruce wasn’t even notified should tell you that Lex was doing something within Wayne Enterprises.   And it’s Lex. Dude is all about the long game.,1

"In my personal opinion I think his agent is a hot mess, she is fairly new to the game and has been providing him with mix signals. My guess is somewhere between the mix reactions to MOS and BVS she probably wanted to distance him from Snyder in hopes of A getting a better deal for them and B Be provided with a better director and story so he can become more marketable. She probably thinks the whole universe started with Superman and in a matter of 3 or 4 films including SS we are introduced to 15 plus characters which takes the direction off of her client. It was more or likely her that stood ground on the Shazam cameo if I was Cavill I would’ve distanced myself away from her ex wife of the Rock or not she is way in over her head playing hardball with studios and making him look unapproachable as a result",2
Basically yes.,1
"yeah, I like that Snyder didn't hold the viewer's hand with little things like those scenes at Lex's event where Clark picked up on who Bruce was, but I feel some things just went over many people's heads, especially those not too familiar with comics.",2
"I provided evidence to back up my claim. You ignored it and attacked me personally. Would you like to stay on topic, or would you prefer to concede that you're being intentionally obtuse?",0
Ah ok that makes more sense then.,1
"> Just because it's in watchable states as Momoa claim doesn't mean it's finished. There need to be a lot of editing, CGI and sound mixing not to mention the score might need change as well. These thing are not come free and it would cost a lot.   There is no need for editing.  Many of the processes they've worked on from pictures shown by Snyder are only done with picture lock.  SO no, editing is finished.  Junkie XL recently again stated that before he was fired he did finish the score.  Pictures were shared of Gal Gadot in January doing ADR.  the only thing confirmed to not be done by the VFX supervisors for the film is that they said a great many  shots were complete and some were nearly complete.   >Snyder era already over and you guys need to accept and move on. DC are go with different direction and a lot of cut content in JL can contradict with their future release.  Except he is still a producer on films, meaning he has input and helps with production.  As is his wife.  All the DCEU movies will still follow his lead.   >There are high chance Snyder cut gonna getting even more negative feedback and with DC slowly coming back. That is the last thing they want.  Where does this ""high chance"" come from?  >There are high possibility that JL Snyder cut is instead of give Snyder fan closure, it will spark another of their movement instead... like going back to Snyder direction or demand studio for Ayer cut. Which again not something studio like to bother with  We will.  And if they do release the Snyder cut, it would lessen the bad look even more to release Ayer's cut.  Which is done anyway and would cost nothing for them.  We absolutely already plan to fight for Ayer's cut after we finally get Snyder's",0
Sooo I've always being a fan of Goku and DB in general (always a fan) and it really pissed me off that people said Superman was better than Goku.   After watching MoS for someone that knew the core of Superman it changed my perspective of him. Not only showed me that he can struggle but also showed me the HUMAN SIDE of Superman.   For someone that always liked Batman (thanks to Nolan) MoS is a fucking masterpiece.,2
Hope Wan turns down the cheese a little and utilise this guy in a much more effective way.,3
This isnt a Zack Snyder sub. It's a DC cinematic sub. People can have a different opinion. And some people are of the opinion that the speech bubbles were dumb. Wan showed that you can have an entire movie without needing them. But Snyder thought that speaking underwater didn't make sense so he made them speak in bubbles.  It was a bad idea.,1

">Shut the fuck up. You are being totally condescending once again.  How nice. I'm being ""condescending"" because you keep claiming to understand and to have done research but you dont seem to actually know what the conclusions of any of the numerous studies on the matter are, the conclusion being that positive representation of different demographics help with self identity issues as well as being treated as a normal member of society, helping to remove harmful prejudices.  >Just because I understand and research a social issue doesnt mesnt I have to agree with the logic behind it.  But there is conclusive evidence behind it, it's not some baseless hypothesis with no evidence. Again, if you had actually done any research on the topic you would know that media representation effects the way people view different demographics.   >A criminal kills someone, I understand and research why he did it, does that mean I know have to love the murderer and support him now? No. Not at all. I just understood what drove him to that point.  That doesn't even make sense, they're not comparable, it's a false analogy.   >And you're done because you know you are wrong and have no idea what you are talking about  I'm done because it's like talking to a brick wall who claims to know what he's talking about but in fact doesn't. Again, do some actual research rather than just claiming to have.  >because you're probably q liberal science major who won't do anything with their degree and will be paying off your student loans when they are fifty,   My education is of no relevance to this argument  >thinking the world revolves around you  I am well aware the world does not revolve around me, I'm well aware that I'm not special. But what I am is an empathetic member of society who understands that due to a lack of/ distorted media representation, it has caused unfair biases in out society, and any decent human should want to erase those.

"> Damn, is that a coincidence or an M.O. of his?  I'm not personally confident in calling it an M.O as it's ""only"" two films, but it's still pretty substantial, and just as annoying.   > Collaborative scoring is nothing new to DC fans.   Aye, RCP scores tend to include quite a few additionals. I've seen a good few people outside of the RCP circles take issue with it, but I feel modern film composing trends towards it in general. A good number of major composers do it nowadays. Performance rights organisations are where a lot of credits are sourced from, which is reliant on the composer actually crediting their additionals. People should be taking less issue with composers like Zimmer, and focus on ones like Brian Tyler: that dude doesn't credit *any* of his additionals, which means they receive no royalties.   > Can't say I am, but I hear you on the woes of being a scorehound.   Ah, said site is where all of the DCEU scores have leaked. In fact, I'd wager that it's where 99.99% of score leaks have occurred. There was actually a discussion about how unreleased scores drop on /r/DCEUleaks the other day, but they're essentially traded & sold until they lose enough value to be dumped online -- on that site. I wouldn't be surprised if it's recovered, but the owner has been MIA for years. Would be a big hit to decentralise the leaking community.",1

He can be someone like Kahl Drogo where he just grunts in a made up language, but no way should he ever be in a role where he has to talk back and forth with other actors for a whole movie.  Seriously imo he has the worst delivery of any actor I have ever seen.  I guess it doesnt matter for a kids comic book movie.  But damn is he bad at talking, especially when compared to actors like Phoenix and Bale, the latter two are legit amazing actors.",0
"no one like that horrible performance, if you can even call it that",0
That was pretty much Anne Hathaway’s Catwoman minus the cow even then the eyepiece was pretty similar.,1
"Yeah, I can see it. Nice to see some New Gods content on this subreddit",2
"Id say, Snyder.    It's the closest thing to the comics. It feels heavy and gritty. At the same time challenging. Every punch feels like an impact.     Followed by the 60ies. They do it really well, for the campy universe it represents. It's ridiculous and hilarious at the same time. Just the fact that Batman many times use Robin as a weapon/prop is just the tip of the iceberg.     I like TDK trilogy, but the suit and the camera angles make the fights look like capoeira (or a stiff choreographed dance). He is just too stiff to make the fights believable..    Some are Ok, like the brawling with Bane. But many scenes, looks like the goons just stand there and wait to get punched.   Same problems with Burton's batman. The suit is too stiff for good action scenes.",2

"Also Affleck was never to be an eternal Batman, after the JL movies and his he was done but then Snyder was booted so that didn't help.",1
"yeah, they canceled Krypton AND the Lobo spinoff (Lobo was absolutely hilarious and I'd definitely have watched that show)...though there were some rumors floating around that they were shopping both shows to other networks.  Swamp Thing was great, especially if you're into horror (mostly body horror like The Thing, Hellraiser, etc.) and the practical effects were on point.  Definitely worth a watch even though it's been canceled.",1
"I get that, and I agree I love to see real integrity in the industry.  But this becomes a bit of a slippery slope. We can use the same argument for Alan Moore telling WB and filmmakers to not proceed with a Watchmen movie.  He'd been incredibly vocal about it, and snyder still took the job and had to skirt around any questions involving Moore's distaste for the production.   Whedon did the same.  His agent got a call from WB saying they're screening JL and looking to hire a writer to clean up what they have and reshoot some scenes.  Both Whedon and Snyder in their own positions knew that they were going to jump onto a project the original artist is opposed to, but took the paycheck any way 🤷🏻‍♂️",1

MCU was still on the up and not quite the juggernaut it is now, so by the time DC had already started turning the wheels on their 'catch-up' plan it was too late. But atleast they are trying to make something out of the rubble instead of entirely abandoning everything, also a change of management helps",1

And dude, if you really think BvSUE was that bad, you've only seen good movies in your life. There's a reason auteurs like Nolan and James Cameron have nothing but praise for Snyder, and why opinions on his movies always change over time.",1
"So tell that to WB, tell Patty Jenkins; I say, WB asked James Wan not to approach Snyder to ask for advice on Aquaman and for something they have turned a deaf ear in everything related to the ""Snyder Cut"", in the end the study points to the public outside social networks Not people like us.",0

"So a reiteration of what we always thought.   Cavill is immensely proud of MOS - he's said so numerous times both before and after the movie came out. ""I don't think I'd change anything"" about sums it up.   BvS was more frustrating for him as I'd imagine he felt a bit sidelined and was somewhat upset that Batman was kinda ""taking over"" the movie for him. And as much as I absolutely loved his arc in the film, I still lament that we didn't get to see more of classic Superman lore like his life at the Daily Planet, his romance with Lois and his Superman dealing with people on a more personalized level.  And JL was... Well... embarrassing. Especially for Cavill; a guy who is making a career off his good looks and leading man charisma... And his face looks like a human ogre for 90% of the film. Not to mention that, as a character arc, his Superman becomes a literal caricature of what the studio thinks audiences wanted moreso than a natural progression of where he started from in that Superman, as a person who has had a life/death experience, grows to really appreciate his life after coming back from the dead, so he naturally becomes more upbeat and happy.  The culmination of his arc should have (and likely would have if Snyder's movie got released) been the embodiment of Superman's thoughts at the conclusion of the Return of Superman comic story.  ""I should feel tired, but I don't. All I want to do is fly. I'm rejuvenated in a way I never thought possible. I have no idea what's coming next, but I know whatever it is, I'll handle it better than ever!""",3
">They should embrace how different they are.  That's exactly what they are now doing. Continuing with dark would be embracing dark, not what they are. Aquaman film was perfectly suited for the cheesy over the top action adventure film. The childlike wonder of Shazam made it great to watch as well. It's a kid after all, no need for WB to make it dark for the sake of it. But Joker should be dark, and that's exactly what they did. WW84 will be cheesy and campy like the 80s and Batman will be dark and noir. Each film embraces the tone that best fits it",1

How did Batman's story change in SS?,2
"Bale was pretty big, much bigger than pattinson will ever be. Its just that his suite was very slim. Affleck was pretty huge, but his suite had alot of muscle patches integrated on top, which made him look like a beast.  If pattinson manages to pack on about 20 pounds of weight, with good distribution to its overall structure and about 10-15 pounds muscle, that would be amazing, but also extremely hard to achieve. But even with +20 pounds he is still pretty slim. And I think its totally fine to have a more athletic and less beastly Batman",2
It’s a Superman centric film but follows Batman more,2
Actually Selina is usually depicted as Latina.,3
"Good argument. But funnily enough that ones actually liked.

"> In their attempt to fix “mistakes” that actually weren’t there (ToO dArK, ToO LonG, ToO SeRiOuS, NoT sMilEy) they made a huge mistake, and they have to rectify for it if they really are the “directors studio” they priee themselves to be.  I mean... those were the criticisms of both movies lol.  You and me not agreeing and making fun of it doesn’t mean their opinion doesn’t exist.  They can be a directors studio while being protective of their property.  Marvel does it all the time and yet the directors still get to take risks with the property, they’re just calculated risks and they make sure it works within the story.  > MoS and BvS made together 1.5B dollars and broke BlueRay records. Regardless whether you agree or not, the fanbase for both has always been existent and very huge.  I mean yeah without context those are great numbers.  The problem is... we have context.  Adjusting for inflation BvS isn’t even the the highest grossing movie for either character.  And Batman v Superman barely even made it into the top 50 all time for Blue Ray sales (a metric that has been tracked for like 10 years).  > If they didn’t like Henry as Superman, the Internet wouldn’t have broken in two when the rumor of him leaving started to float.  This didn’t happen anywhere near the degree you’re implying outside of this sub  >If thwy didn’t like Affleck as Batman in BvS, I wouldn’t have seen so many people to this day praise Affleck’s Batman.  I didn’t say they didn’t like Affleck I said they didn’t like the character that was written for him.  >JL Batman is a direct result of WB turning the film into something that it isn’t so obviously it didn’t get the best reaction to “ouch my leg hurty”.  I agree I literally said people didn’t like JL Batman either lol  >The fans are not small groups, the haters have been so obnoxiously vocal for so long they do seem like the majority, but they arent.  The fans are not as big as they should be, and that’s all that matters.  You cannot tell me the money WB made from MOS and BVS is anywhere near what they should have made.  They objectively disappointed compared to their projections.  > Zack Snyder was never aiming for Endgame levels anyway, he cares about the fans more than he cares about money.   ... are the people who watched Endgame not fans??  Where did they get the money from?? And you literally just proved my point about him making a blockbuster property for a niche audience.  >Endgame is a result of two decades  years of building up an event so important that next to no one cares as much about the MCU when it came and went.  Yes, but you’re totally missing the point.  Endgame was the result of *single* decade of building up an event with characters people *barely even knew*.  Literally the most established MCU characters before it kicked off was the Hulk and Spider-Man, who they didn’t even own for the first half of their story.  Batman and Superman have been in popular culture forever.  While obviously Endgame is unrealistic without tons of movies building up to it, there’s absolutely no reason a movie with Batman and Superman can’t cross a billion dollars.  Nolan did it after one movie with only one of them.  >To say a movie must make Endgame money to be considered a success is very shallow.  And to say a studio with Batman and Superman shouldn’t expect a movie featuring them both to make a billion dollars when Spider-Man, Aquaman, Black Panther, and Captain Marvel are doing it is incredibly naive to the business side of movies.  Acting like Batman and Superman should be treated like an art house project is literally not how the world works lol.",0

"It doesn’t really contradict the idea because otherwise he would have just gone on a typical mad villain rant about killing him and making the people suffer, Supes killing him wouldn’t be an option. But he VERY clearly told Superman that the only way this will end is either he will kill Supes, or Supes will kill him. He’s pretty much asking for it. Threatening both Superman and the people he cares for in order to get him to do it. And just think about the final scene, Zod really could have killed that family with his heat vision at any time, but he gave Superman all the time in the world. He was trying to force him to make that decision. It seems like both what the character said and what Zack said line up here.",2

"From a visual standpoint, the softer pastel style just doesn't jive with modern generations. The 4K release of Superman 1 got criticized a ton for it, even though that was always part of the movie. Higher resolutions just don't do softer images any favors. And when you use ultra bright colors in a sharper movie, you get Neon Garbage like Josstice League.  The visuals weren't what people disliked about MoS and BvS, hell the visuals are the most praised parts of them. Just adding brighter colors wouldn't make people like the movies more. Hell, look at most of the Russo Marvel movies. They aren't hyper bright for the most part, they have very similar colors to MoS (BvS happens to mostly take place at night so that's irrelevant).  Suggesting that you can make people like it more just by turning up brightness is ridiculous. The problem people had with MoS is simply that the timing was horrible for a slow-building deconstructionist Post-Crisis approach to Superman, and BvS' problems with the GA were mostly from the awful Theatrical Cut. Am I saying the GA was wrong for the former? Not really. I'll swallow my pride and say that with how sick of the 2000s edgy CBMs people were at that point, a darker take on Superman never would be accepted (Even though MoS is better than 90% of those 2000s edgefests). Thing is, that would've ended by JL anyways, that was the whole point. If they had just stuck to their guns for JL, changing some things AFTER that movie to a different general direction, it would've flowed much better since Superman was always being built to be more optimistic. It's the Classical Greek Hero's Journey:  Challenging Beginning - Ultimate Test - Death (Sometimes Metaphorical, in this case literal) - Rebirth (Ditto) - Optimism brought to the land. But we didn't get any optimism. We got cringe. Death is itchy apparently. Ugh.",0

"See, I don’t totally hate Whedon.  For how rushed he was it actually isn’t that bad imo.  Like, the “somethings definitely bleeding” line.  Within the context of “do you bleed? You will” and the seriousness of the situation in BvS, it’s kind of funny.  The issue is, the movie isn’t a parody of BvS and instead spent the last hour trying to take the events of BvS seriously, Batman specifically.  It’s almost like they made Batman a parody of himself.  I think the line would have been a much better form of comic relief if Flash said it.  Like, picture the same scene starting with “I remember you”, Superman says the “do you bleed line”, and in the background you see Flash getting in his sprint pose, in real time (so not the super slow mo to be clear) sprints over to help Batman and Superman just completely sees him coming and throws a fist out.  Batman and Superman continue having a more tone appropriate scene considering their situation, before going to Lois Superman notices Flash struggling to get up (thinking he’s going to keep fighting) and Flash in pain musters out “trust me I’m bleeding”.",3

That’s a matter of public record. Emmerich has no pragmatic reason to want to release this cut. He was one of the guys shouting the loudest to get rid of Snyder to begin with. The article says loud and clear that Hamada is one of Emmerich’s top lieutenants, so he’s not gonna be championing for a Snyder cut. Don’t want to anger your boss and mentor.",1

There are parts that are obviously great since they were shot by Snyder but its painfully noticeable when it switches back and forth between both directors. The score is also in my opinion horrible and bland thanks to WB and the new composer( Danny elfman?) so overall I say skip it and wait for the Snyder cut. Even if it never comes out you won’t have the horrible taste left in your mouth from what could have been. Justice league was probably the biggest disappointment of the 2010-2020 decade.,0

He's killed in EVERY single cinematic version, and explicitly kills in several comics over the years.  The only difference is that BvS doesn't avoid the result of being a Bat Vigilante.  It follows through on what that means if you push that idea to its brink.    So you don't really have a problem with Batman killing, you have a problem with how the movie uses it.

The only thing relevant is your second sentence. The rest is complete hogwash. And I already told you, WB can easily keep Shazam it's own world despite seeing glimpse of newspaper clippings and magazine covers. The fact that no character face is legible (e.g. Cavill) makes it that much easier. Mention of other DC characters mean they may exist in their world. Smart thing to do if you're leaving yourself a few outs for future crossovers, but they can just as well keep it to a Shazam universe.  There are two Alfreds, two Batmans, two or soon to be three Jokers. Why do you need mention of a multiverse to see that they exist in different universes? Hey I got an idea, how about just going with the fact that they just do? And if you happen to see easter eggs of other DC characters, how about thinking they exist in that world instead of implying connectivity to others? Sounds good to me. I'm pretty sure Reeves' Batman is its own universe. I'm pretty sure we'll see easter eggs of other DC characters too.

Clark doesn't bother to contradict him or act like his accusation is ridiculous. Seeing this Superman do that wouldn't break internal logic but it would be jarring. It's out of the way enough it doesn't affect anything like the tectonic plates thing.  The rocket was better distributed than the building.

For the record though, I do think symbolism and foreshadowing works best when it's not mentioned ALL THE TIME.  I do think the painting concept is cool, but when everyone is talking about it, it loses its appeal.  Or take Rey standing on that pit overlooking the ocean in TLJ, it literally looks like the Jedi Order symbol or a symbol for balance, if you use Rey and the two cliffs to form it, but if everyone caught on to that, it starts to seem like old hat.

"I think Affleck and Cavill are different though. Yeah, Ben left even though het got on stage at SDCC 2017 and said he was still Batman, but you could tell the reception of BvS and his own personal problems burned him out of any enthusiasm of the role. Reports that he was leaving came out as early as early 2017.   Cavill however DOES want to stay. Even though he's gotten burned in his portrayals, the dude still loves the character (named his dog Kal lol), and even said recently that people should stay tuned for what he has planned.",3

"Id kill to see it in a cinema. We know Zack shot it with an IMAX resolution, and I never saw it in theaters the first time around as I was waiting for the director's cut, so I want to go very much.

"> Dude, Mankiewitz (Who wrote the Donner movie) literally calls his script a Jesus allegory.  No, he doesn't. For one thing, he merely rewrote the script that they already *had*, cutting a bunch of stuff and rearranging it so that it would work as a film. For another, the only interview I can find where he mentions Christ symbolism is in the Jor-El scene -- he says he thought of it as an allusion to God sending Jesus to Earth. However, that's *one scene*. And he was *subtle* about it. (The rest of the film isn't a ""Jesus allegory."" That's silly.  (*Superman Returns*, on the other hand, wasn't and was terrible. Using that as evidence is like trying to use *Suicide Squad* as evidence that the DCEU makes well edited movies.)  > It's like the deaths in Infinity War, more important for how it changes the people around them than for the death itself.  Except we know and care about those characters a hell of a lot more than we've known about this Superman.  > Not to mention, you say we don't know this Superman, I call BS.  You can call BS all you like, Snyder's Superman is basically a blank slate. His big emotional scene at the end of MOS is gone by the next scene and never mentioned again. How did his father's death affect him? I have no idea. What about knowing he's an alien? Nope. Okay, but surely we understand why he likes Lois? Actually, *nope to that, too!*  > But to claim that we don't know this Superman when clearly there's just as many people invested in this Superman as any other is just flat out wrong.  It's not wrong. Snyder's Superman had one and a half films before he *died*. There's a reason BVS is so thoroughly criticized, especially for that ending (and for the numerous other missteps it had). Welling, Reeve, Cain -- they all had not just better movies/shows, but *better writing*. That's what it all comes down to -- the writing.",1

"The only time he's possibly in denial about killing someone in the book is with the Joker, he's not shown to be an unreliable narrator in the story apart from that scene, it would be really weird for that to have changed for that one scene, especially when again, the police are hounding him down for breaking and entering, assault etc but wouldn't bother charging him with murdering a kid? This batman is shown to be someone who *wants* to kill bad guys as the world would be better off without them but physically can't bring himself to do it, for that to change for just one scene feels weird and betrays some of the themes of the comic.  To interpret it that way means you have to assume Bruce isn't reliable, and I feel you need to make assumptions about that as the book doesn't really imply that, to me atleast, when he is being unreliable with the Joker, there is atleast some evidence like the grey balloons and him talking to the jokers dead body as if it were alive. With the mutant teen? There's nothing, it's not even mentioned again, if he didn't shoot them in the head, wouldn't miller have brought it up again?  I also luckily got to meet miller at a con and ask him about this, he said he didn't kill the mutant, he didn't even really care about where batman shot them. But obviously things change and miller may or may not have actually intended that when he had originally written and had drawn the story.   You can interpret the book in any way you want, I'm not saying Olivia or Snyder are inherently wrong on the issue as personal interpretation of any media is correct if it can be justified, and that scene ooc can definitely be read as batman killing them, but I feel that if batman did shoot the mutant in the head miller would have addressed it in the book, he's not a careless writer or artist (well, back then atleast), the story doesn't make sense to me unless this batman is so staunchly anti-killing, as it's such a big part of the book (The Dark Knight Returning to his principles) and it's what makes the climax with the Joker at the end of book 3 so great, as in that moment Bruce *might* have lost his principles and broke that promise, which makes him essentially want to kill the batman identity and become something else (before miller decided to continue with DK2 and DKIII obviously)",1

Again, note I say “so far”. I only have what they’ve shown to go on, and *so far* it looks horrible and I’m going to be saving my money.",1
"> Dude i don make it up.we don see wonder woman for like 40 second or so after she is being blasted by doomsday.  I just went back and checked it. We don't see any of that. The last we see of Wonder Woman before Superman flies off is her disappearing in a cloud of CGI dust. Whether or not she's incapacitated isn't shown at all. You've just made that up for the sake of argument.  >Also wonder woman don have her shield when she is being blasted so far away  If not having her shield meant she was left unconscious or struggling following that eye blast from Doomsday it sure would have been nice to actually see that wouldn't you think? As it is she gets hit with the eye blast in a quick shot where she's not even visible for most of it. And the next shot we see her is her throwing the lasso over doomsday. If she was incapacitated between those two shots they made no effort to show that. Why should they? Because that's just basic filmmaking. A half second shot of her unconscious following the blast an we wouldn't be having this conversation. And expecting the audience to just assume that she was incapacitated by that when we've seen her laughing off something similar isn't a well thought out choice imo. In fact her smiling like that was apparently something Gal Gadot improvised. I think Snyder should have stuck to his original vision and left that unplanned shot on the floor. It seriously detracts from the menace of Doomsday. You might think that's a ""nitpick"" but those sorts of small details really *really* matter.  >so what superman is lucky?   It doesn't make for good believable drama when things happen by coincidence.  >he choose to risk his life as he is the only person near the spear and when he see he got opportunity to stab doomsday, he just go for it. simple as that.  But he'd just seen WW, who *wouldn't* be at risk using kryptonite, inflict heavy damage on DD without it. And if you go back and watch it he's *definitely* seen her just do that right before he decides to sacrifice himself. He's seen the safest course of action for himself and everyone else but weirdly chose to ignore it. *If* we were shown her knocked out and him being aware of that then *absolutely* we people would be more willing to buy that he had no other option. But we aren't and you're having to make stuff up rather than thinking that *maybe* it would have been worthwhile to show us that.  (And I'm very open to the possibility that they might have filmed such a shot. But that means nothing if it doesn't make it into the edit where the storytelling of the scene all comes together)  >You are nitpicking regarding about batman. when doomsday first unleash the shockwave, the scene first show batman taking cover before showing superman and wonder woman withstand the blast. so superman knows batman is fine.  Superman didn't know that cover would be enough to save Batman.  >Im not interested to further talk about this since this is nitpicky and not relevant  It's relevant when *you* are arguing that he sacrificed himself because he didn't want to risk Batman's life.  >I'm not interested to debate about crowd of people present. This is exactly what I want to avoid in talking about What shud have been  Okay. But the point is that if Snyder wanted to sell it on the terms you're suggesting, that Superman had no choice because Doomsday was about to explode again, then he needed to indicate why Superman felt this was so urgent when a previous blast didn't hurt himself, Batman or WW. ""It's bigger"" isn't a particularly compelling argument. And he doesn't even make such an argument in any case.",1

Hypothetically what changes about Clark Kent if he’s not white? Just like Arthur Dent being Polynesian.  Like say Steve Rogers - if he’s black or a minority that changes his story since he grew up in the 40’s. If Black Panther is a different race it changes his story.  Clark Kent being Hispanic (like DJ Cotrona who was cast as Supes back in the day) or black or whatever else doesn’t change Clark’s story any more than Nick Fury being interchangeable as white or black.  Implying that he can’t be Clark because Clark has predominantly been white is illogical considering Aquaman is predominantly white in comics and everyone loves Mamoa as Aquaman.

Collect all the famous characters! :D - but what bothers me is if he's out why are WB so damn weak they can't just say so? They had a perfect opportunity when that pay negotiation crap went down.  ""We'd like to thank Henry for all the work he's done for us, but we're excited about what the future of DC films holds."" Easy. Done. Suck up the fan rage for a few weeks and move on.  But nope, they went ahead and used Cavill Superman in Shazam afterwards. They want their cake and eat it - use the goodwill he generates, but not give him any opportunity to prove the character himself.",1
"I partly agree, but I personally think that Cavill was out for a brief period, maybe contract negotiations weren't going well (hence why they approached Michael B Jordan), but they managed to get everything sorted out and now Henry Cavill is still firmly our Superman.   Wouldn't surprise me if the Rock had something to do with Cavill staying on tbh.",3
"\>  he just didn't click with people (me included)       IMO, his version of Superman (Snyder's vision) was simply too depressed, angry and mopy. For those like me who grew up idolizing Superman in the  Justice League & Justice League Unlimited TV series, it felt off.       In Whedon's version, we see Superman smile and be playful for small glimpses. When he told Barry he was off the team if he lost the race, when he hugged & was happy to be back with Lois in the farm, when he joked with cyborg he was just getting used to be being alive, those short moments, it felt like the real Superman to me.     All in all to say that Henry is the perfect Superman.",3
"Imagine if Reeves movie is in DCEU.  Pattinson's Batman can age in Affleck's Batman. Wright's Gordon can't age in Simmons Gordon. Which means there are two Gordons in this universe, having the same job, one in 90s, another in 2010s.",0
I'd cum in my fuckin pants if Junkie XL did the score like he was supposed to too,2
Yeah I know. Just trying not to set myself up for any more disappointment. This post was actually made in the hopes that I’ll actually get to show my potential kids the real Snyder cut :),1
"Do you really think that WB is interested in anything related to MOS, BvS or even JL? this point of the game, continuity will give a damn, except Black Adam and Shazam himself there are no plans to make crossovers with other superheroes, if there were still references in Aquaman and Shazam to the DCEU it was because it was too late to make changes, there are rumors (and I emphasize, rumors for those who want to correct me) that WW84 is a movie that not only moves tonally away from BvS but also from the first part (who has read the spoilers in DCEUleaks confirmed by ViewerAnon himself, will know that I mean) and let's not even talk about The Suicide Squad by James Gunn, so expect many contradictions with the other movies from now on, at the end of the day, the only ones who care about continuity are the people involved in this more not the casual public that ended up repudiating BvS and SS and didn't even stop by the cinemas to see JL.",0
"Agree. I like BvS and love watchmen, but the MoS is simply not the superman i know",0
What arguement? You are the one being thick here,1
HBOMax was never on my radar until this new push of the Snyder Cut movement and I'd happily start a subscription if the cut was included or was said to be coming to it.   I'm sure there are others who would do the same. And if there is another push I wonder if it'd be worth tagging hbomax as well alongside RTSC.,2
What's up with his Green Lantern movie script? I just can't believe out of all things were getting a green lantern tv show over a movie version.,1
ya so is superman and martian manhunter and like a million other dc characters  edit: If you arent human you are an alien,2
Looks like a Michael Bay Transformer.,2
"I mean, I create custom folder icons for organization. It's just being a neat person.",2
"Nicolas Winding Refn.   Constantine.    Please, CBM gods.",1
Darkseid looks like a monster because he’s corrupted by the Omega Force. Before that he was a pretty human looking dude.,2
"The repercussions is successes.   JL is one of the worst movies ever made. And the more people talk about the recut, the more that line will be repeated.   ""Wants fans a recut because the original is so bad even they can't watch it"". Sadly, you will still be talking about that 5 years from now.",1
Him and Snyder’s run is my favorite run of all time.,1
"Ohhhh, I see it now! Thanks. Was looking in the corners and right at the top / bottom!",2
"Jeff Bridges for High Father, Denzel could be a good Darksied. You could even reverse them and have Denzel as High Father and Jeff Bridges for Darksied. They both are great actors.",3
"Fantastic actor, I think he’s going to be one of the greatest things in the movie.",3
Batman and Wonder woman will most likely make 1B,3
"I wouldn't try to think about the continuity that much, think of the DC films more akin to FoX-Men than MCU.",1
"""Must..save...Scoop..""  ""...why did you say that word!?""",1
I feel the Shazam crossover could help reinvigorate interest in Supes (Since the Box Office will kill it if it's at a good time with all these stars),2
"A Riddler movie would be truly unique in the superhero genre  Outside of that i could see this inspiratiobs from Saw, The Game (that was also Batfleck's influence)",3
Atleast he could have avoided Flash falling onto Wonder Woman's boobs.,1
">At the cost of a character which represents the majority of your society?   Do you really think that if superman were a black man people couldn't suddenly relate, or its costing the movie of its character?  >What is it with minorities thinking that their cause is more important than the sum of the society's people? How entitled do you think that sounds  Its not about being more important than the sum of society, it's about being recognised as a proper member of society. What's entitled about wanting to feel like a person?",2
Half Life 3 confirmed,1
I hope to someday be able to stunt on hoes as hard as JO,3
>there are millions who support the movement  There probably isn't even a million people who know what a Snyder Cut is lmao.,3
"I half agree. I think she did a great job with the optimism and heroism in WW, and could nail the characterization, but I wanna see how WW84 turns out first. It’s gonna be much more outlandish than the first film, and Superman is often a more outlandish character",1
Sit down.,1
"Welp, I have no reason to not believe you :)",3
"Funny enough, multiple viewings had the opposite effect on me in regards to BvS. I was super hyped for it. On repeat viewings of BvS, after the hype from the anticipation wore off, I found more and more problems I had with the film. I defended it a lot when it came out, but now I’m not actually a big fan of it anymore. That’s not to say I think the movie is terrible, I just find it interesting how repeat viewings can have different effects for different people",3
"They could have just held a meeting to appease one of their bigger stars, or decide that it could be different enough to do it as a spin-off.",1
I never said they were going to give the role to Skarsgard.,1
If you click on my profile I’ve written the full plot summary for the Snyder cut for everything that is known.,2
Would of loved a movie with this whole cast,3
I would read a Snyder cut comic in this style of drawing this is amazing OP,3
"Does Black Adam also transform whenever he shouts Shazam? I just imagined a scene where he's like: ""Hey, Shazam! Oh, shit..""",1
"For all things that DC's been perceived to be lacking in, talent has never been one of them.",3
"Yes, but they were Snyder’s shots that he filmed",2
Yeah they’re definitely trying to put some distance between the new stuff and the “Phase 1” stuff.,3
"Aquaman is an old school style action/adventure with the skin of a modern spectacle. Hell, so is Wonder Woman.",3
To be fair The Lighthouse probably felt like a small/niche movie while filming it,2
> or option two is do a Flashpoint movie first to explain the recasting of Batman.  Why use an entire film just to explain a recasting?  Did Marvel have to make a multiverse story for you to accept Mark Ruffalo replacing Edward Norton as Banner?,2
"I hate articles like this. Unless I’m missing something there is no rumour here, it’s all just conjecture.   > A potential moment of Superman's sacrifice transitioning to scene of Steppenwolf letting Darkseid know that time to strike is now would be an epic, and thematically concise way to continue the Zack Snyder DC saga.",3

Momoa doesn’t look like Arthur Curry. I’m just saying.,3

Good. Fuck Gotham for cutting medication funding,2
"I suggest you find someplace to discuss DC stuff, this sub is already taken. No point trying to turn it back. Let them have their fun.  Funny...

Lol ok boomer,3
He's huge in the Arkham and Telltale games as well but yeah they went more with the Hulk thing,1
This news to people or do people just forget from when super returns came out,1
"Which is why I hated this movie. Too much gangster inspired sht because of Ayer. They’re criminals, not gangsters.",2
I find the DC Billion dollar grossers more impressive because they did it without China,1
Oh I know,1
"He looks great.   While I don't have much confidence in the CW to do a good job on the Crisis event (their shows, IMO, have really taken a nosedive in quality), I still want to watch it solely for the amount of people they've got to play these roles.",3
She already has plans and ideas for the third film. Would be ideal to let her finish her series.,3
"Not to mention his hate of Nolan. Yeah, they got a guy who considers TDK a movie with ""meh filmmaking"" to direct Batman.",3
Good. Now focus on the cinematic universe. Give me Superman!!!!!,2
"Yeah, they are falling into the same trap others are of having odd expectations of entirely different directors and projects.",1
"People have different opinions i know that, but you ain't acknowledging that some people in this subreddit will hate a DC movie if it isn't gritty and gloom like BvS,   [Mate some Snyder fans will not accept a DC movie that isn't directed by Lord Snyder](https://mobile.twitter.com/TCLangWrites/status/1134956139945312258)  [what I'm talking about ](https://mobile.twitter.com/CarlShinyama/status/1192202887838994439)   [check out some of the comments he ain't trolling he's a Snyder fan](https://youtu.be/zysOeMj3jqU)",1
"Lol @ anyone who believes this. Black Adam 2 would hypothetically come out in 2024 or later, meaning 5 years *or longer* from now. If WB has already planned Supes next appearance, it definitely isn't in a non-Superman film sequel that will likely be released in the latter half of the 2020s. People really have to learn to exercise some degree of discernment when reading claims from lower-level scoopers.",2

I hope it’s not actually long Halloween.,2
"> Snyder's JL was always going to be more optimistic dude  I agree. The first JL trailer (with Snyder's footage) felt tonally much more ""lighthearted"" than BvS or MoS did. I actually think the tone of the trailer felt very in line with the theatrical cut (which I know will be an unpopular opinion, lol). His cut of the movie definitely was gonna be a more high-spirited film than his prior 2.",2
variety doesn't print bullshit articles. They clear have high up sources and Justin Kroll is not going to pull shit out of his ass.,3
Lika BOOWSE!!  #ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
YESSSS,1
Imagine a Battfleck/Deathstroke brawl like Arkham? Damn...,3
It pisses me off so many people deny this was the plan and think Superman was gonna be a brutal Injustice type the entire time.,2
YA but the old gods were just powerful aliens that humans called old gods. What are smokin,1
That is just pure beauty!,2
Gimme the gravy Zack,1
Deadline reported first that it's not in the works so it's more THR vs Deadline/Wrap,1
">Snyder's JL was always going to be more optimistic dude. That's literally the hero's journey, the darkest step (BvS) always comes before the ascent of hope (SC of JL). Snyder's Superman was always going to become the more optimistic figure. Only under Snyder we would've gotten some actually good Donner-esque stuff and not the Quest for Peace level garbage Whedon gave us. Death is itchy? C'mon.  Was Man of Steel also not a hero's journey? I wouldn't exactly call that movie all that optimistic",1
"Henry is just clinging to the last shred of hope that WB will give him another movie and doesn't want to do anything to hurt his chances. Sadly, I don't think he will ever wear the suit again, as WB has already made several moves (Shazam headcut,  Hoechlin tv show, JJ talks, Michael B. Jordan pitch) to show they have no problem moving on without him, so it's going to be for nothing. Ironically, his best chance would probably be the release of the Snyder Cut, for if it's positively received it could reignite interest in seeing more of him in the role.",3
WB made the right choice. Concept art for that design looked horrible.,2
There isn’t anything to disagree with. You don’t seem to understand what a character actor is. You can choose to think of a character actor in your own way if you like but words have definable meanings for a reason.,0
With Marvel dying down it’s time for DC to shine. As the great Heath Ledger Joker once said . . “And Here we go!”,0
Now we have even rules for easter eggs...,0
Even before JL they shit the bed  BVS tried to do way too much at once,0
Oh shit I didn’t know he was set for TENET,3
#STOP,2
Because it serves no purpose other than to force a political agenda on others.,2
"Agreed, although Suicide Squad actually came before Wonder Woman.  Which makes the order look even messier.",1
MOS is genius. My favorite super hero film. I will continue to defend this film until the day Cavil is caught on video kicking a puppy.,3
"If WB is pushing back, they're doing it via trades. Not random posts on reddit.   Like I am annoyed about the articles too but no sense jumping at shadows",1
So why did Joker also make a billion dollars then? I wonder if that means there are people who want to watch amazing action movies and people who want a focus on good stories,2
"The magic you are refering to is just mutants using biological powers and shit. Stuff that doesnt require tech or science, and it gets dubbed as magic. But its just their innante natural abilities due to evolution or mutation",0
Pretty sure Snyder is just being cheeky about the photo. This looks like her voicing over the original History Lesson.,3
"I’ll look into it then, thanks :)",2
"$400 and $300 million, respectively.",1
They are a reputable trade with proven record.  You are a rando on the internet making shit up and throwing a tantrum because they said something you don't like. 😂  Get a life dude. One that doesn't revolve around a movie.,2
God that was so stupid,3
except it doesnt look ANYTHING like the tumbler?,3
Box Office has nothing to do with the quality of the movie. Captain Marvel grossed 1B and Wonder Woman didn't.,3

"Do u honestly believe ben is coming back? What remote reason would WB have for doing that? They have a perfectly fine movie in the works, why would they want to undermine that. Face it, we aren't getting any more snyder stuff besides maybe his cut. Justice league was a catastrophic bomb, we aren't getting a second one for a long ass time, and certainly not with ben.",0

Comic book movies are never subtle,1
The war is coming an end.,3
You can't pick and choose what someone says just to make it fit your argument. You have to take everything they say into account. Clearly you're trying to pull a fast one by cutting out what she said in the end.  You really shouldn't have commented since you're a fool.,1
"Wholeheartedly agree, just meant overall Affleck was outstanding.  When he punches a guy into the floor is pure Dark Knight Returns brutality and I love it.",1
"""My wife... *walked*... out on me""",1
Okay let's put ourselves in his shoes. How does he come onto a production like JL not knowing what he is meant to do? What do you think the studio told him that made him think he was morally okay to do what he did? Also once he knew what he was doing (since he had to at some point since he was the one writing and directing the changes) why didn't he stop? It seemed the promise of a batgirl film was enticing to him.,0
"Anyone with a brain knows this. However, wouldn’t releasing it basically confirm how stupid WB was for screwing it up with Whedon and reshoots? Why would WB want that egg on their face? Maybe if whoever was in power was no longer there I could see it happening or as some have surmised...because HBO max is coming out.",1
"I know I’ll be in the minority but the more I see clips of endgame, the more I’m glad I never saw the movie.",0

Yeah I miss it a bit. The recent Patrick Gleason run on Superman was filled a great balance of wholesome moments like this and serious stuff and it was honestly one of the best Superman runs in a while in the comics,0

i need the second page... i need to see the reveal...,1
">they need to release it and get it over with  Why though? What benefit does it do them?  And yeah, WB are at fault. For handing him the keys to the cinematic universe and allowing him to drive it into the ground.  And I said arguably imaginary.",0

"Less principled according to standard superhero morality, yeah?   If I remember right, you can make the (not perfect) comparison that it's like if Killmonger and T'Challa fused.

He's your Khan or Mesopotamian leader that will cut the hands off a thief.",2
THERE IT IS! MY MAN!,1
"You aren't listening. What I'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter that people don't like the movies. Half of the Reeve movies were panned even harder than MoS and BvS. Yet people still acknowledge Reeve as fantastic. Cavill is also acknowledged as having a lot of potential BY PEOPLE WHO HATE MOS AND BVS. That's what I'm trying to say, is that liking MoS and BvS is irrelevant. Just like people who hated BvS still loved Ben and Gal. And people who hated JL loved Momoa. You haven't been listening to what I'm saying at all.",1
Which figures are these?,1
And the 'Heroes' trailer. It is my fav part about the movie.,1
"From the Variety article it sounds to me like they called him in and said ""okay, your movie just make a billion dollars. Give us another similar idea and we'll run with it."" and Phillips said ""okay....lemme get back to you on specifics"" because he had nothing in the tank ready to pitch.",2
Maybe if he kept some of the curlier hair he had early on in MOS it would look better. I prefer that hair style anyways.,1
"Yeah but Snyder Cut haters on the whole just sound like dumbasses at this point.    It’s like what the hell ar wyou guys even fighting for at this point? Not letting others see an alternate cut they want to see? I mean, Jesus.",1

"lol someone's misinformed. I still don't get how some people's argument against this movie is that the theatrical JL was bad. That's partially the point of people wanting the SnyderCut. Lol it's gonna be night and day. And if you didn't like MoS or BvS or any of Snyder's other work, than it's just not for you. Nobody's forcing anyone to see this.   And on a side note, when/if they release this, that should be the end of it. It'll end on cliffhangers and raise questions that will never go answered. WB/DC are moving forward in a brighter direction imo. No need to muddle the waters anymore. Just release it to appease fans and leave it at that.   As much as I enjoy MoS and BvS:UE, the movies still aren't all that good. If they're interested in Snyder making something, just make it a DC Black film and let him do his thing. No holds barred. Just don't spend $250M on it.   Affleck doesn't need to come back and I doubt that he wants too. Cavill wants too and if anyone can bring him into the fold, it's JJ and The Rock and Dany/Hiram Garcia. They're about to produce one of the three insanely intriguing DC films of 2021 and there's no way Black Adam won't be huge. That year, along with 2019 and 2020, is showcasing what DC/WB wants to do. DISTINCTION.",2
"Tbh I don’t want them to go full phase 3 with all the movies about Superman or Batman having 3-4 other JL characters. I want solo movies to be about the solo character. Just like they are doing now. And also, have team up movies too later.",3
Ahw cute!,1
I think it's going to be a mix of adventure and horror. Maybe an origin story for these creatures. It's definitely releasing on HBO max.,2
Looks like something from Halo: Combat Evolved.,1
There's no way that you're honestly so fucking stupid that you don't know what hyperbole is. I'm not falling for your weak ass trolling.,0
*Tuggah!*,1
If that’s truly his attitude then for the life of me I can’t understand how he and the studio haven’t been able to reach a fair deal.   These are those times you would love to know what the hell is going on behind the scenes?  Superman has always been the face of DC and you have someone that “seemingly” loves playing the character and all involved can’t find a way to make it work? That’s a darn shame!,1
"1) This is awesome!  2) Zack is being cheeky. This is Diana’s (Gal’s) first time seeing Darkseid most likely, pretty sure she’s recording the audio for her voiceover description of the history lesson scene.",3

"I REALLY think Geoff Johns played a major, major part in this (yes I know he falls under ""WB"" at that time, but still...). I still don't think he's happily landed after what transpired and I wouldn't be surprised for his involvement with DC to lessen even more in wake of the merger, the seemingly-likely release of the SC, and the incredible delays in all his current comic work.   And I say that as a big fan of Doomsday Clock.",3

"""Morally ok?""  Directors being hired to finish films is nothing new. It's a job. What was he gonna do, say no? Snyder was GONE. Whedon didn't steal the film or take it away from Snyder. Why say no to the opportunity of putting your stamp on the JL? If it wasn't Whedon it was gonna be somebody else.   It seems you people desperately want a villain in Whedon, when all he did was do what he was hired to do. The film was gonna get fucked with either way, Whedon did what he felt was best. Set aside your bias for a moment and look at it logically. Do you honestly think Whedon maliciously changed the film...like a damn villain? To fuck over Snyder? No. He was probably told to correct what WB deemed wrong with the film and to give it his own spin. He did. Hate it all you want, but the only bad guy here is WB.",2
Well I have some of the original photoshop files for the chinese marketing campaign so I can try make one later.,1
old news bruh,2
great opening,1

This cuts off half of the original comment...,2
Any reference for the Nolan thing?  I never heard of that before and would be curious to look into that. I don’t doubt it just curious,1
People hate him because he ruined the DCEU.,0
I understood the reference.,1
How about they just do injustice where Snyderverse is the evil regime side of things and  Abrams does the Resurgency and eventually they do an elseworlds crossover I know mind boggling where Affleck meets Pattinson and they just recast everyone,1

"Why must everybody in the dceu kiss zack snyder's ring? like seriously wtf.   Also by your logic Patty Jenkins didn't bring back Alan heinberg for ww1984 because he was a snake for his involvement with joss, instead, she brought back Geoff Johns who was also in the meeting with joss, and was involved in JL, to write the screenplay for ww1984 with her ?????? make it make sense.   Can you guys stop with the unsubstantiated conspiracy theories??????",0
Ik. I was exaggerating,0
"Further, the RTSC info directly contradicts Mark Hughes’ Forbes article in terms of cost to complete, etc.",2
Still think it was a terrible cast...She looks like a homeless junkie in most her photos...,1
Geoff Johns was in way over his head. His first movie as a studio executive and he whiffed it so hard he’s now relegated to producing shows for the DC app,2

He is fiercely loyal to his people of Kahndaq and will do anything to protect them. He is not above killing and he is crazy powerful and he knows it. So he can be a terrifying figure to come up against. But he has also worked with heroes when it suits him. He’s got a big don’t fuck with me I won’t fuck with you energy.,3
Anyway being the most remembered doesn’t exactly have anything to do with how accurate or good his performance was.,1

Yep in today’s PC not gonna fly expect a name change to Isla or something,1
"Ya know, I’m something of a DC villain myself",3
Yeah. But I still don't quite trust Bruce's interpretation of events.,1
"The thing is this.  WB wanted to move away from the Snyder era, under Geoff Johns.  They wanted to after the massive failure of JL.  But at the same time Aquaman hit a billion and Wonder Woman likely will do gangbusters as well.  What a lot of the Hollywood insiders are hearing at this point is WB saw what they could do with Joker and believe they can make films in and out of continuity and be successful.  So it comes down to if they release the Snydercut, and fans lose their minds loving it.    It is massively screened on HBO max.  Makes them a great return on investment.  Sells merchandise.  If all those things happen for it, then it would be absolutely a good business move to finish his work with the follow up JL movie they wanted (After he introduces fourth world and all of these characters we found out about)     Technically the Snyderverse goes strong anyways.  And there has been a lot of directors and actors who left because they were there for the Snyderverse and not the Geoff Johns Marvel copy verse.  In my opinion, especially when the MCU is really in a way going to be starting new, this is the best time for DC to set a precedence of having a movie universe kind of the same way they build a comic universe.",1

I think it would be great if Jason did the same on that day. He's been vocal about it but his push on the same day would've added a lot more buzz and pressure.,1

"Maybe when the guy THEY HIRED starting doing massive rewrites to a story that's already been halfway finished and thought out. I heard whedon was like this with Marvel, it's the reason we didn't get Ed Norton hulk, whedon wanted complete creative control other than feige when it came down to the creative process and Norton wanted to be a part of the writing/directing. I imagine DC faced a similar situation with him they should've just told him to fuck off with the rewrites and finish the story.",0

I'd rather Noah Schnapp or Timothee Chamalet. Noah's kind of short but he'll grow naturally and they can just make him look taller.,0
I hated how Batman acted the majority of that film. He was a generic marvel character.. not batman. That moment was neat but it would have been nice to see a progression. Not him fumbling like an idiot. Batman doesn't do that.,1
OH SHIT LET'S GOOOOOO,2

"I imagine he's referring to the fact that Brian Tyler composed the entire film, only to get bumped off and have the bulk of it replaced by Danny Elfman. It's more similar to Justice League than it is to Suicide Squad imo, but regardless, rejected scores (Tyler's AoU score still had parts used, so not really fully rejected) are sadly not too uncommon.  Edit: [Here's the tracklisting of the leaked recording sessions](https://i.imgur.com/nBREjUW.png). That's 3 and a half hours of score for a 2 hour and 20 minute long film, so the score was a bit of a shitshow. According to Hybrid's comments, Elfman was in the process of replacing all of Tyler's prior work.",3
"Great read, and very thorough. The only thing that you missed were the recent Henry Cavill developments the past few days. His interview in Men's Health where he insists he is still Superman as well as Hiram Garcia's comments that they are interested in using Henry Cavill's Superman in Shazam/Black Adam projects. We shouldn't necessarily read anything definitive from those statements, but I have been saying that unlike Affleck, Cavill wants to remain in the Superman role. The Rock advocating for and pulling strings for him may go a long way in keeping Cavill as Superman in the DCEU, regardless of what a potential director may want. Another interesting tidbit from the Garcia interview is the confirmation that Black Adam is in the DCEU. The recent news of the JSA, Dr. Fate, Isis, Hawkman, etc. being in the movie shows the DCEU is alive and well, and WB is not afraid of still doing crossovers when relevant. My takeaway from all of this is that the DCEU is still WB's priority for DC going forward. Joker is definitely not a part of it, and The Batman is currently up in the air but I believe is more likely to connect to DCEU than not. If they do a future Justice League movie, they'll want to use Battinson if he has been successful. Assuming they do Gotham City Sirens after Birds of Prey, it would make sense to continue using Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman. The DCEU can continue to be different from the MCU by allowing directors to flesh out these individual worlds while still being connected enough to allow for relevant crossover and the occasional big team up.",1
I want all them,3
Lol there’s no reason to make it that complicated. Just make them talk. Jesus.,3
I love the way Affleck's Batman moves you can tell he was trained by Ninjas. But I'm so nostalgic for how Keaton fights yes it's a bit stiff but idk I just love it.,1
Now this I can get onboard with.,1
"Holy fuck. Why didn’t wb just fucking release these films. Such an epic saga, ruined for what?",2
"The trinity is the Soldier, the Knight and the God.",1
its already opened in all markets apart from China where it won't open. Also its losing screens to newer movies like Frozen so its numbers will keep going down,2
"As much as I dislike the Snyder DCEU, I can't deny that this is one of the best scenes in film history.",1
"If they weren't successful he wouldn't have been given JL. However, exec change up during the time, like promoting Johns, interfered with his work and fired him as well as cut down his whole work. Keep in kind Empire strikes and a new hope were critically terrible at the time toom pretty harsh or mixed reviews.",0
Zack also said on vero don't lose hope. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
"I've read yhis one article somewhere maybe ScreenRant about why WB don't want to release the Snyder cut.  They said it might be possible WB didn't want to messed up the 'more standalone movies' with the Snyder story (JL part1-5).   like MCU, the story ends in 11 years. maybe they want to extend the DCEU more than that and just go slow.  or maybe they just didn't like Zack Snyder (imo).",1
"Apparently, IMDb still shows that WB has retained April 3rd of 2020 for an ""Untitled DC film"" that was supposed to have been the release date of the Cyborg solo film.  If they really release the Snyder cut of Justice League, i want to see it in theatres.  REPEAT  I WANT TO SEE IT IN THEATRES.  Besides, HBO Max is not going to be available in India, where I'm from. So that's going to be a problem if i want to watch it.",3
"I think it’s fair to assume that no one gets a good look at Batman’s mouth hole except us, the audience. And maybe Gordon, who traditionally doesn’t care much to figure out his identity. He operates at night, moves extremely fast, and probably leaves most of his enemies with concussions. It’s no surprise they don’t remember much about him.  As for Superman, there are some comic panels that try and explain it. The most plausible ones say that Clark is essentially the world’s best actor, as he can control his muscles precisely enough to completely change the way he moves and speaks. His glasses also make his eyes seem grey instead of blue. And there’s the fact that Superman doesn’t wear a mask, so people aren’t really looking for a secret identity. They probably just assume that Superman IS his identity and that he lives somewhere remote and doesn’t have to eat or interact with others unless he wants to, which isn’t too far from the truth sometimes.",2
I think that a hypothetical MoS2 should maybe open with a montage of Superman helping people like this kinda in a similar fashion to Spiderman homecoming where it shoes Spiderman stopping crimes and giving directions to people,1
"Well you can't deny that some of the most virulent critics of TLJ are genuinely sexist and let it transpire in their speech.   And even with them put aside, you have to agree that Johnson-haters are exceptionally repetitive and unrelenting in their tweets about him and his movie. 2 years after and the critics are still bashing him and TLJ to no end. God bless Snyder for his cool temper, but I'll be damned if I won't be allowed to vent about haters of my work.  Snyder is a soft, kind-hearted person, and he's cool-headed. Good for him. But other people are more hotheaded and defensive about their work. Because a director angrily reacts about people trashing him personally for doing a movie doesn't mean he's ""subscribing to typical stereotypes"".   And don't forget that a large part of the BvS fanbase was also following the ""no, you're the one at fault for disliking it"" for a long time, the comparisons with the pro-Snyder crowd are so blatant that I can't help but laugh at people who love one and loathe the other.",0
The target for that movie was women and lgbtiq people,0
"Why does it need to be after The Flash? The premise and inclusion of unique villains like Captain Cold and Heatwave can stand out without having a Flash film first. That idea would also be exactly like your Catwoman film where you believe you need the hero’s film and you don’t, otherwise it won’t be standalone.",1
Henry is not leaving.,1
I didn’t really say anything about continuity. GA will still get confused when they end up seeing adverts for something they watched two years ago. I still know of people who aren’t really invested in these films wondering why Christian Bale wasn’t in BvS.,1

"Please, just release the SnyderCut",3
But would he want to bang you ?,3
Is Zack actually releasing the movie frame by frame?,3
"Lol, that isn't why TDK made a billion. Sure, it helped a bit but the death of an actor doesn't mean a movie will make 5 times the previous one. BvS almost certainly should have made a billion with that WW opening weekend (like every other movie in that range). It just ended up having terrible legs",2
I'm more disappointed by Justice League but I would watch it over Superman Returns. Justice League is definitely bad but Superman Returns was just a dull snooze,2
Yes my sources tell me no because we're on reddit and not running major Hollywood studios,1
I might do a fancast soon.,1

See what I mean?,1
RIP ripped Batfleck,2
1. This film needs to stay a solo film. Certain films are so well done that it doesn’t need a sequel and Joker was one of them.  2. Deathstroke should be on that list of DC origin movies.   3. I would like to see “DC Black” in the opening.,3

What happen when he put on the suit ?,3
False to everything you have said.,0
I agree with Jeremy.,1
I actually think he should get a solo movie in the same style as Joker.  Truly a character with a tragic fall who we could all relate to.,2
"Before JL came out and all the cast members were contractually obligated to hype up Whedon's movie, Cavill was heavily on board with Snyder's take. And since then, recently he has expressed a lot of disapproval towards how he was treated in theatrical JL.  He's just trying not to upset WB when his position is in jeopardy. Gadot and Momoa can say whatever they want, they're too well liked. Fisher can say whatever he wants to, he's out anyways. Cavill is in a more delicate position.  Let me put it this way, I'll trust the words of several cast members who will get no consequences for speaking their mind over one who would have to put his job in jeopardy to say anything. If I were in Cavill's shoes, I'd keep my mouth shut too.",2
Oh I know. And I still think these are the color edited shots from the TC. I'm just being pedantic.,2

"That was a great scene but the big difference is it wasn't corny/eye rolling/lame and it was actually pretty funny and wholesome with the little conversation spidey and the kid were having as he walked him out of the alley.   Superman saving cats out of trees and talking like he just came from the 60's is not funny or wholesome, its corny.",0
"I'm Latino and was pretty bothered that Nolan white washed Batman's few ethnic villains (Ra's included). I loved Hardy in that rendition since it's fiction and it doesn't have to be completely accurate, especially with Nolan's take. However, now that we're being more inclusive in casting nowadays, accurate representation matters. He's dressed as a damn Luchador, make him Latino",1
I thought he was going to be Scarecrow in The Batman.  No?  Pretty sure that has been heavily rumored.,1
"To the reasonable-minded, it's rather clear what Snyder was going for with Henry's Superman arc: he wanted Supes to have a reason to do what he does.  Why does he feel the need to help people wherever he goes?  His goodness doesn't just happen in a vacuum, there must be a reason for it.  A ""why"" as Snyder says.    BvS unraveled Batman and Superman to see what it would take for them to break their moral codes.  For Clark, when the whole world has betrayed him, all it takes is Lois to make him see Superman as worth it.  Just like Martha helped Jonathan feel that doing good is worth its cost.  Clark accepts that nobody will approve of Superman yet still returns, faces Lex, kills Doomsday, dying for an Earth that hated him.    Even then, in JL he would be reassured of Superman as he watches the League unite in his honor.  That's what the scene of him flying above Earth in space was all about.    And yet... Snyder's Superman is ""not accurate,"" ""depressing,"" and ""not heroic?""    Child please.",3
I like when a casting comes out of the blue and was not on fancasts. Shows the casting director just doesn't go for the easy solutions.,1

Batman fights as Batman only in BvS.,1
I would love him as well,1
Not really   We’re talking taking something out of a good part of the cut which requires entirely new texturing and probably some modded animations.   Plus as you said it’s probably taking 40-50 million to do just that which is an unnecessary cost considering they already may need to touch up some things.   This ignoring the fact they already have one they put time and money into,2
"That's not how it works. I believe he was fired and in the movie industry no one says they fired a director, it's always like ""creative differences"" and such shit, in this case they used his daughter and since they are making a contract they can't even talk about it. Of course if it's a big thing that a director did they'd say they fired like when they did with James Gunn over pedo shit. But if the case is ""creative differences"" they don't say so the movie don't look bad, they need to do a good marketing. I wouldn't go to a movie which had a fired guy.",2
The Question  Plastic Man  Lobo   Steel,1
I don't know honestly. Could work or could not. I think the idea that because a director did well on one project doesn't automatically mean they'd do well with another.   People are a bit quick to get excited as well.   WW did well and people said Patty needs to just run it.   Aquaman did well and people said Wan needs to just run it.   Shazam did well and people said Sandberg needs to just run it.   Joker did well and people said Phillips needs to do all the darker movies.   I'm rooting for whatever director wants to keep Cavill or can work it out with everyone involved to have Cavill in it.,1

"You talk like I said it wouldn’t be great to have it. Of course it would be, just not remotely the same. Its end will be mixed for me.",2
Clooney’s only problem was that he didn’t understand the divide between Batman and Bruce Wayne. He had the alter ego down but forgot to flip the switch when he suited up.

Compare that to:  - The reveal at the docks - The subway fight - Hong Kong - The Tumblr Chase - The ferry conflict  - The batpod chase when he reemerges after 8 years - Batman vs Bane - The last hour in the Dark Knight Rises  Those action setpieces were bigger spectacles and felt more epic.

I guess Black Adam doesn't take place in this universe either.  Seriously, you should summit your conspiracy theories to Alex Jones, I'm sure he will pay you good money.",1

Ripped? Absolutely.  Put on significant muscle mass? Nope.,3
Why? I know when he did Red Skull he notoriously loathed it because of the hours of makeup but Dr. Fate just wears a helmet,1
I don’t blame Henry at all for not joining in. He probably wants to fight and cling to the role as long as he can. Maybe he’s already spoken with WB or his agent has. We don’t have all the details. So him not being apart of that push doesn’t surprise me one bit.,3

I wouldn't know because I lost faith in that franchise for putting out like 3 shit copies of the first Transformers so if it were me going to the movies that weekend in the mood for sci-fi/fantasy/action I'm going to give the ""fresh"" movie series a shot.   So yea, it had competition. It was just weak comparatively. Do you honestly think it would have even come close to those numbers against Capt. Marvel opening on the same weekend?",0

It's unfathomable that WB won't just keep him.",3
I didn’t even know Black Canary was in this movie. Who is playing her? This movie is gonna fail and fail hard. Somehow DC took a very simple and easy to pull of premise and shit all over it. Pretty much none of them look like their comic counterparts except Harley and even that’s a stretch. This is why Marvel owns DC in the theater even though I am a big DC fan.,2

It's very simple; 'Hey Henry, we might need you, so don't do anything too drastic looks wise. Thanks.'  Paramount is allowed to be as petty as they like (and, you know, they weren't) as he was under contract with them. MI is one of their few successful franchises, so there's no way in hell they'll do anything but minimise their risk as much as possible.",1
"All the news we have suggests that ""The Batman"" is not connected to Zack Snyder's DCEU (the movies that you mentioned). Those movies will likely be ignored going forward.  Right now Warner Bros. is focused on individual franchises. There are no plans for a DCEU like the one we've had before. We'll have Batman movies, Wonder Woman movies, Aquaman movies, Suicide Squad and Harley Quinn movies, plus Shazam and Black Adam movies.  If all those franchises continue to be hits like Wonder Woman and Aquaman were, then Warner Bros. will probably explore crossing them over with each other. But right now, there are no plans to do that. Multiple Warner Bros. executives have said that standalone movies are the focus going forward.",3

Darkseid has looked like Darkseid wellllllllll before the New52...,1
Technically he's just repeated what was released to us way back when. He'd hardly bash his own work and act like there was another movie (which there is apparently).,2
"I hope Hawkman is played by John McLean and we get a scene at the end where he dives off the top of Nakatomi Towers and stops Hans Gruber from falling and then it turns out Hans Gruber was really the Sheriff Of Nottingham.    Then Hawkman hands Gruber over to Oliver Queen who says “seriously guys I’m not Robin Hood” and Gruber is like “then why are you dressed like Peter Pan, Locksley?” and Shazam (who has been drinking Cola in the background) says “Burn!”  And then Will Smith lights up a cigar and says “Welcome to Earth.”  Cut to Black. ...  Obviously it would need to be an end-credit scene otherwise it wouldn’t make sense.",0

There's one shot where the camera surveys the land as Jor-el is, seeing all the destruction,  and it just looked like a comic book splash page come to life. So much greatness in that movie.  Even the Pa Kent death, as stupid and needless as the circumstances were, it still pulls at my heart every time.",2

I mean, they used to be humans anyway, they'd have the same way of communicating, but I guess it's creative, but again, feels mostly unnecessary.",1

It’s because birds of prey is an original story with interesting characters. It’s not a worse remake or unwanted retelling of a classic franchise. ‘Woke’ movies can be good. Wonder Woman did it right. Wasn’t overbearing but she is empowered above man as a god and still had faults,2

Been waiting on this particular comment. Very dumb comment,2
Not really the point of your post but at this point we don’t need labels. They never gave the cinematic universe a name so why should any of the standalone films get one? There’s a good chance ‘The Batman’ is going to be its own standalone franchise and I wouldn’t consider that “Black” or “Elseworld”. Same thing applies to the potential New Gods movie or Blackhawks movie. Just let DC films be DC films. If any of the films decide to crossover with each other that’s great! If any are meant to standalone franchises or a one time thing that’s great as well. Just make well marketed good movies that audiences will enjoy.,2

"I mean, honestly, I didn't care about the Snyder cut, because I figured, ""how much can you really change?"" right? Because the villain was flat, with little to know character whatsoever, the dialogue was clunky, the lighting and cinematography, for the most part, didn't fit the tone, and again, I can't stress how poor of an antagonist Steppenwolf turned out to be. But now it's abundantly clear that Snyder just made a different movie, with a cavalcade of characters who didn't even make it to the screen till Aquaman. I don't know how much better his cut might've been in terms of plot and characters, but it would've been something completely different for sure. Whatever it turned out to be, however good or bad, it deserves to be seen and given a shot. #releasethesnydercut",1
"> He obviously struggled with killing Zod that doesn't mean he can't be proud of what he accomplished. Saving the whole world.  Sure. But him never bringing it up again in any capacity after that doesn't help in terms of it supposedly being a significant part of his character development.  >Batman wasn't a threat, he was a broken man standing in the way of Martha's safety. He could have killed him in an instant. He didn't want to. He also didn't have a clue that Batman had a beef with him.  ""Ripe fruit his hate.."" Plus why wouldn't Batman have beef with him after he thrashed his car and threatened him? And he knew that Bruce Wayne was Batman and that Bruce Wayne hates Superman.   >Why would he? Batman won't listen to him so he shows him what's what. What human is going to argue with it? He's expecting Batman to comply because what other choice does Batman have, after all he can't hurt Superman...  ""I have to convince him to help me"" Throwing a person around who, as far as you know, can in know way harm isn't going to convince them of anything other than how right they were to mistrust you. Superman took a big risk and that suit protecting Batman with that first push. And he took an even bigger risk smashing him through a building and slamming him into that light.  The bottom line is if Superman's attempts to reason with Batman are totally illogical then people aren't going to buy into the character development.  >Wonder Woman was already restraining Doomsday and he was about to release a huge wave of energy again and become more powerful. Time was a luxury they didn't have at all.   But there's nothing to suggest any of the characters knew what the others were doing. Superman flies off before she throws the lasso and she throws the lasso before he shows up. That's not coordination and a race against time. It's just a lucky coincidence.   >Organising Wonder Woman killing him with the spear isn't an option. The time was now and he took it.  We never get to see him facing any such dilemma. And the fight started with them all managing to survive a blast from Doomsday so they had time. Now if the fight had migrated to an area where there were some people in danger of being killed then it would make more sense and actually give us a moment where Superman has to make a tangible and meaningful choice. As it is he sacrifices himself because it suits the story but not because the situation actually demands it. That's why so many people found it to be an empty moment.",0

">I'm saying the burden of proof is on the ""insider"". Not the journalist.  The proof here is that the insider is an insider. Meaning that they know what happens inside the studio. So most likely conclusion is that the insider is someone who works there.  >It's not the journalist's fault that they can't call a source on BS and have to report it.  They don't have to report it. If the journalist thinks that the info might be BS, they can either confirm it from another source or simply not include that info in the article. Variety's article wasn't just one news story, so if Kroll had thought that the whole ""Snyder cut is not happening"" thing is inaccurate, he most likely wouldn't have written that in his article.  >He wouldn't get fired for saying ""we're not doing anything"".  No, he wouldn't get fired for saying ""we're not doing anything"". He would be fired because if his name was on the article, suits at WB would've seen that a guy named Whatever Whateverface is talking with press without their permission.",2

Lex Luthor is the only thing that really makes sense. Only real character that has a name. You could easily ground the character and to have to make a $100M movie.  You just need a serious actor with some chops and clearly a fantastic script.,1

Not sure how you could think that I meant that at all.   >Im pretty sure there is a big difference between being punch by doomsday and being blast by the super laser beam and i'm pretty sure that laser beam did far more devastating damage than doomsday physical attack.   Both the audience and Superman have seen her being able to withstand both Doomsdays eye lasers and one of his blasts.  >Plus unlike superman, wonder woman did better because she is clearly shown to be a better fighter rather than just being a brute and keep on tanking a hit like superman  Doesn't that, along with the fact that kryptonite severely weakens superman, make her the best candidate to take doomsday out?    >So?? The movie clearly shown that superman saw wonder woman being incapacitated and even if doomsday hand being chopped off,  How is she shown to be incapacitated?  >doomsday keep on building up energy and may gonna trigger again another explosion and does not seem to be stopping.

"Season 1, episode 3.",1
The way Cavill spoke about superman's future in DCEU recently in an interview is kind of similar to what Ezra has been saying about his flash movie.   He wants to please the fans and understands very well that it is the first live action movie.  He genuinely wants to perfect it and that maybe the reason why he himself pitched the plot for film.,1
I’m so happy to hear him say that,1
"It’s stuff like this that makes movie studios dumb down their story and explain everything. Actually watching the movie, you pick up on all those little clues and you have to think a little bit about why and how Batman was driven to this.

"The whole Donner/Lester and Snyder/Whedon is actually a really apt comparison.   Can't believe it's been sitting in front of me this whole time and I never really saw it, despite being familiar with the Donner Cut.",1
"It’s clear he’s out, they don’t want him back. The mention of Michael B. Jordan should make that clear. He can say what he wants in public until the next actor is cast. In the same way Affleck said he’d do anything for Reeves. It’s just PR.",2
Except he’s not right and you’d have to be blind and not watch any comedies to even think otherwise.,1
"It has happened plenty of times before. Terry Gilliam's Brazil was fairly infamous because of it. Iirc the studio wanted it cut/changed for American audiences, Gilliam refused and took out a big ad in a newspaper then did a private screening for US film press/critics to rave reviews. He completely tied the studios hands and forced them to release it.   That said, I cant think of a film on the scale of Justice League both from a financial perspective but also the sheer popularity of the franchise.",3
"Then they did it wrong. You have a source material there’s zero point why you wouldn’t follow. Looking for total realism in these movies is Pretty silly.   But the suits didn’t go completely different though. What’s so different between those suits in the movies compared to the ones in the comics? The armoured Batman suit was basically the same from TDKR.   The suits were fantastic. Aquaman, Mera, Black Manta and Ocean Master were on point. As a fan from the Aquaman comics I was incredibly happy to see them being translated to the screen so perfectly. That’s everyone fanboy’s dreams.",2

"I always said that I love both Superman themes (Williams and Zimmer).  Williams’ Superman is THE classic superhero theme. The instant you hear it, you feel “It’s a bird, it’s a plane! It’s Superman!”  But Zimmer’s Superman... I’ve always been more of a Batman guy, even before I really cared about superheroes, but the Man of Steel score makes me feel like **I** could be Superman, like I could fly into the sky, cape flowing and wind in my face. It has an uplifting tone that really inspires a feeling of hope.",3
Isn't the whole point of Jerome how many hoops they can leap through to avoid calling him the Joker?,3
"My point is, it's a very simple request.  We're not asking him to go on a press tour.",0
absolutely does,0
"no, but most people dont watch tv in real time nowadays. but i can dvr all the batman movies and watch them whenever i want",1

I do agree with you about Rogue One, I loved it.",1

"The UC is certainly better than the TC. Whether it’s actually good or not is certainly up to interpretation. (It’s probably not, but it’s at least not filled with plot holes like the TC).",1
That doesn’t change the fact that I want to see the Directors cut!,0
"Yeah, I'm aware. We've had these sorts of discussions since the ""The cape is in his closet"" comment last year. I was asking if there was anything more substantial than that.  \>, AND you pay Cavill like you do Dwayne WB.  Also this will NEVER happen, btw. There is a better chance of everyone in this thread here winning the lottery than Henry Cavill getting a salary on par with Dwayne's.",2
I don't believe Leto is in Birds of Prey at all? maybe there might be a suprise cameo post credits that could potentially set up this film but i highly doubt he has any major involvement. That being said apparently WB have already confirmed that the Joker/Harley film is already in development so doesn't that mean they are already committed to it whether or not Birds of Prey is a success or failure?,1
Let us hope we get this or the BvS design in the Snyder Cut.,1
"That's not what he said. He said you're living in a Dreamworld if you think that they make no mistakes. Mistakes include the neck snap and Batman going brutal after years of losing faith in humanity. He never said the killing would continue, they were mistakes by the heroes after all.",1
"Yeah that's a good point. Even still, I think it's ridiculous people get this up in arms about it regardless of how much sense it makes. I understand having little nitpicks with a film, but a major flaw? Come on. It has no bearing on the actual plot or story. It's just a neat easter egg that they thought fans would appreciate. Wrongfully so, apparently.",1
"For real.  I thought the goggles looked stupid, and his cowl didn’t look right either.  It reminded me of Night Owl from the Watchmen movie, should have just stuck with the Batman v Superman suit.... also, not sure if it was Whedon or Snyder’s call, but Superman’s suit in Justice League looked like ass too.  It looked like a Joel Schumacher version of a Zach Snyder idea of what the suit should look like.",2
"To each their own, but because he didn’t do good in one role means he won’t do good in another?",1
Ok yeah you're right. It's been a long time since I saw it,1
"It will turn into. ""Its still not his cut. Its a compromise."" Already getting some of that. The possibility of this cut being released bothers some people way more than it should. Especially members of THIS sub.",1
Don't listen to the heathens. Charge your phone whenever you want.,0
"*sigh* This makes no sense.  Whedon didn't worm his way into the possition. WB DIDN'T WANT SNYDER on the film anymore. After he left to attend to his personal matters, WB used the opportunity to axe Snyder and hire Whedon.",3
We've been Steppenwolf'ed,2
"I agree, they have a new approach that's fine however what they did to Zack is definitely wrong and unethical. To listen to the fans, and respect the filmmaker, releasing the cut is great pr and respects fans and Zack. Wb after all is known as a filmmaker driven studio.",3
"I'm already doing that.   ""Go SeE jOkEr BrO, IT's So GoOd""  I'm not seeing that shit. I'm not giving WB another cent. I want the Snyder Cut. The only money i'll pay after that if they ever released it is a proper Man of Steel sequel and everything that lives in the spirit of Zack moving forward. Period.",0
"To add to it, Dwayne The Rock Black Adam Johnson liked it!",1
"I'm saying the burden of proof is on the ""insider"". Not the journalist. It's not the journalist's fault that they can't call a source on BS and have to report it. Also, that doesn't apply here. The ""insider"" didn't announce anything, he did the opposite. He said nothing of substance. He wouldn't get fired for saying ""we're not doing anything"". We can plainly see they're not doing anything.  Y'all are taking this way too far.",0
Wait when were Nelson and Cavill attacked,1
It kinda is a competition. People will only go to theaters so many Times a year.,0
Don't get me started man.,0
Great actor,3
We were robbed of Snyder’s “horror” approach (as he called it) to the apokoliptians. We could’ve had something truly unique smh.,3
I mean I get the Wayne Manor thing as him being very smart but the cave thing is pretty dumb. So he's seen the batcave? And Bruce is supposed to relate Lex using the word cave with Batcave? Tbf I think it's a stretch . . It's also nice that this Lex is an idiot when it comes to scheming but he's a poetry nerd,0
That’s like taking the president at his word just because he’s the president.,0
There would be nothing subtle about that,3
If you'd like we can discuss it over pm (Just feel a one on one discussion works better),1
"*The Daily Planet criticizing those who think they're above the law is a little hypocritical, wouldn't you say?*   *Considering every time your hero saves a cat out of a tree, you write a puff piece editorial about an alien who, if he wanted to, could burn the whole place down. There wouldn't be a damn thing we could to stop it.*",3

Unfortunately steppenwolf in the snyder cut is the same as the justice league version.,3
"They can pull something close to House of Cards with naughty political and familiar drama, with Clark maybe doing a 1:1 interview with him but no Superman or Lex Armour.",1
"I mean, by definition that is racism... Saying a character will be lesser solely because of their skin color.",1
"And last year WB’s supposed statements were that “it doesn’t exist”. Look how that turned out.  WB is a reactionary studio, it’s just a matter of time.",1
"I specifically was about to type this, best thing to ever come of the film",1
"It’s funny how you say everything that needs to be said in your comment buy you don’t actually realize how the whole situation makes sense.  Unlike Cavill, Affleck has left Batman behind.He has nothing to loose.Ray Fisher is gone as well apparently. Gal and Jason are safe.Henry can like every post out there but out right supporting the Snyder cut could mean the end of his negotiations for the role.",1
"I’m sorry, but this looks like a dumpster fire.",3
"In my opinion,the casting is disgusting-I didn’t said anything else",0
Off the top of my head   Henry Cavill   Joss Whedon (which I think is more likely than many think)  J.K Simmons   Ezra Miller,1
"I don't like this look, but I don't like the final one either.",1
\*Hope intensifies\*,1
"Although I was fucking about with that lock him up in a writing room b.s...  I for one, heavily believe he stirred the pot, and himself and Kevin Tsujihara only had their own self interests there. Johns is jealous of Fiege, and the fact they got Joss over to finish was an obvious attempt at where GJ's stance is.   Joss's comments are not better.",0

Fantastic but misunderstood by some?,2
I mean if James Gordon is black it’s kind of hard for her to be a ginger.,3
I definitely like his armor here over the spandex suit he wears in Aquaman..,3
"Post Mortem success from Hearh Ledger. Movie wouldn't have made as much if that hadn't happened. I'm not sucking off Snyder, keeping living in your small minded world dude.",0
"There’s absolutely no need for JSA to be in this film. All they need is Hawkman, Doctor Fate, and Isis. Let’s see how this goes though.",3
"I'm gonna save it, thank you",2
"And they are both biracial themselves, I believe. So technically she is biracial.",3
"Justice League just suffered cause it was shit. Full stop. BvS, which I enjoyed, had nothing to do with that Frankenstein overcorrection.",1
I would be fine if they just made a Snyder Cut graphic novel.,3
I’m pretty sure WB is saying their money is just as green as the Joker crowds money.,0
Oh hell yeah. I think most of us would. Haha that be funny. Still better storytelling that Whedon.,1
"WHAT ARE YOU IDIOTS WAITING FOR?! JUST MAKE THE FUCKING MOVIE, THE MAN WANTS TO DO IT!",1
"Hopkins played hannibal lecter in silence of the lambs, and calendar man from the long halloween was based off of that role so it makes sense",1
"You said that the old gods were just aliens that humans called god, which 1. Is plain incorrect and 2. must mean you think that the old gods like Zeus (and by that logic, Wonder Woman) must be aliens too.  And then for some weird reason you think that I’d suggest that they should just cast Will Ferrel with some makeup on as Darkseid? Lmao like that’s a big part of where you lose me buddy",0
"Hopkins can play whoever he wants and it'll turn out awesome regardless.   Let him play Batman, I won't mind. Hell, I bet he'd make a great Poison Ivy.",2
Nah dude you have to pick a SIDE and base all of your opinions about everything according to which team you’re on,2
Oh no...the bat butt,1
ReleaseTheBoyScoutSuperman,3
"In Shazam they never said that the modern JL members are the first superheroes ever existed. So maybe the old JSA members are not as popular as Superman and Batman any more. Especially amongst kids.  As far as the MoS, BVS and JL, this confirms, if true,  what everybody say about the continuity. That they are just gonna ignore these events moving forward.",1
"I mean, based on the characters that were in both movies, looks were different too. Mera's hair, Arthur's eyes, their costumes and so on.  >Characterizations  I'm talking about that based on an interview I read back in the day. Jason was talking about how they both had their own unique take on them.",1
Ben Affleck also said joss was the best choice to take over and tweeted #ReleaseTheSnyderCut 2 days ago.,2
Why did lex make doomsday,1
As a halo fan. I want Keith David as Darkseid. He voiced the Arbiter(Alien in gold armor in this video)    https://youtu.be/1G2uz26smY0,2
HTF has Aquaman made that much?  It's ridiculous.  C'mon...,0
Not the only one either lol it’s cause no one really asked for this movie they just assumed it’d be something everyone wanted. Just hope it’s good,1
What did she do to him?,1
"There is no way they could cast someone else to play Joker alongside Robbie as HQ, it is too late for that now.",0
You know what fuck it if we are getting a sequel I'm in. I need to see more of Joaquin Joker in my life cause he was phenomenal in this movie.,3
They talk at length about The Batman despite everyone under the sun talking about it lately. Same with JJ Abrams. He’s been the subject of every clickbait article from here to the sun.,1
This is still better than the theatrical cut.,3
"Not to be that guy but Jor-El specifically looked for a planet where he could fit in, and he chose Earth since kryptonians and humans are nearly identical.  &#x200B;  Yeah, I'm that guy...fuck...",3

"I second this because he still working on the movies, it just listed as his studio rather them him by himself. His worked on Shazam, Aquaman, Wonder Women 1984.",2
I always thought his would be the saddest to tell. I would love to see Victor to get his chance at redemption for a live action movie after the abomination that was Batman and Robin. He is such a great character.,2
I love that type of symmetry in film.,2
"Yeah don’t think Snyder was the man for the job in regards to Superman, his plan was to kill Lois off and the. Have a mind controlled Superman slave to Darkseid. Thankfully WB came to their senses.",0
We've got a problem over here...,1
"I don’t think he had the chance,I think the warehouse fight and the vs Superman was great..",2
I want to see him as President Superman.,1
"If Nolan was there, we'd have gotten the SC back in 2017. Nolan is a giant fan of Snyder's work.",3
yep absolutely.   I actually just remembered that the women in the basement even explicitly call him a 'demon' - so the angel/devil metaphor still applies there too  and my favorite easter egg of Bruce's fall is in the 'Must there be a superman?' montage - Wayne Financial stock is falling too haha,1
Wasn’t that a rumor once that Tom Hanks was going to play Lex Luthor before Jesse Eisenberg a few years back?,2
"If you think Joker sequel has nothing to do with the kind of money it made, well thats just naive.",1
Costner's tornado scene aside I throughly enjoyed Man of Steel.,1
Yea I couldn’t stand Aquaman either. I’m glad the water boy is getting love but that movie drives me nuts.,1
"This, I like this",1
"All I'm saying is that there are better ways to seek attention then asserting yourself  in a conversation that you weren't apart of, answering a question that wasn't meant for you and hilariously answering the question wrong effectively making an ass of yourself.",2
"Tbh, I’m laughing now. I enjoy the movie, but come on, TDK and The Joker are WAY better movies",3
No Batman: Brave and the Bold?,2
I hated those things too but this still has the water talk bubble so it would be retconned either way,3
"Rather than push the film back to give more time, the studio execs kept the release date the same to keep their bonuses.",3
"How cute, you can copy movie scores from RT, the shit stain of cinema. You do realize how irrelevant those are right? Plenty of movies get over scored or under all the time. Just look at current Disney films.   To think you believe Whedon can handle these characters with respect is beyond mind boggling, because he didn’t. He reshot most of the movie and it was absolutely terrible yet your excuse is “he wasn’t there from the start”. Horse honky. He has his chance and he blew it. That’s the sort of denial that comes from someone who’s willing to believe anything as long as Snyder gets dumped on.  Lol Whedon made 2 good films. Snyder at least 4.  Get back to me when you have something that remotely makes sense that isn’t fanboyishly biased.",1
Joker is about the main version of the character. Not Martha Wayne Joker which would be a good comparison,1
"Nice try, dude.",1
Batman in the new PT Cruisermobile,0
Did you not watch the movies? Were they anything like BvS or MOS? Especially Aquaman,1
"Well, that’s pretty easy for WB to explain if they want. Batman will eventually be at the shared universe. Not now, but he will. And when he does WB might not even care to explain why he is another actor. If a Flash movie has happened first then things can be explained by the fans easier.",1
Man I really want this Deathstroke to have more than 3 minutes on the big screen,3
Agreed. Reminded me too much of Schumacher.,1
Voice actor yes but not the appearance himself.   And why are blacks the only minority we think of race bending to?,1
"You forgot the words ""in my opinion""",3
You get Brucebumps.,3
"No he saw he liked her, it's why Joker started to offer her to him. It's why Monster T gets so uncomfortable. I hear before the reshoots that Joker gets him to shoot himself in the head instead of dealing with Joker's torture. - wish they kept that in",2
"It's hard to imagine a sequel would be anything *but* a cash grab.  What more are we going to see? He's the joker now. His transformation was complete as he danced down those stairs. A sequel has like, three shitty options:  It can try to repeat what Joker did. So, re-wind the transformation, undo most of what the first movie did, and just do it again. No thanks, they got it right the first time.  It can be a batman movie, with joker as the villain. Meh? Phoenix's joker was an amazing protagonist, but that was all because of his vulnerability... I have zero interest in following the hero that beats him up. If you give Fleck an army, gadgets or super powers, he loses the human weakness that made him so interesting. Great antihero, shit antagonist.  So, if the Joker stays transformed and stays the protagonist, it kind of needs to be a Joker vs. ___ sort of thing. Almost all of the options there are shitty and dull. I don't want to watch Joker save the city from some greater evil. I'd rather watch Joker vs. some abusive law enforcement type, but that'd still be pretty dull. Joker vs. Batman with Batman as the villain might actually be interesting - Something that shows how Batman shifts in his esteem from a nuisance to a terror to a fascination and mutual obsession - but that's way easier to say than it is to do right, and Aurthur Fleck's Bruce is way too young to make it work.",1
King and queen of Gotham. That is so stupid.,0
The Ultimate Cut?,1
Serious BTAS vibes,1
"Whether he was going to be here or ""part2""  or any future DC films that were tied in. I meant it like that. They teased him for nothing",1
*don’t give me hope*,2
"214 is supposed to be the fullest running time. The Twitter campaign had a goal of 214,000 tweets.",3
"Watchmen has become quite beloved. Even many Snyder-haters refer to it as ""the one he got right"".  Contrivances? Care to explain?  As for Weird Character Decisions, I don't know where you're coming from. Lex acted like he did in most early incarnations (And Birthright). Yeah the 80s reinvented him as a super industrialist, but Snyder's Birthright boner wouldn't have him go any other way. Bruce killing? Been done. Golden Age Batman, Burton's Batman, Nolan's Batman, even Adam West have a body count to them. Aside from that everyone is fairly normal to their comic counterparts. Except Perry White is now Morpheus (Which let's face it, only makes Perry White more awesome).",0
We seriously need to be pushing for Cavill to remain as Superman as hard as the community is pushing for the Snyder  Cut. Superman is central to the DC Universe and Cavill is the perfect casting of this generation. Superman has to return. Continue his story.,2
Me too but it looks like reeves is taking ideas from affleck’s script after all.,0
"So is the article clickbait or is there an answer of substance about the possibility. Because it'd be dope as hell if it did happen (and it was done well),  but I'm guessing the answer is just ""It'd be awesome if we did it!""",3
"Also, as someone that very much wants to see the Director Cut of JL (not a ""Snyder fan"" but very much like his DC movies and feel he deserves to be judged on his JL, not someone else's), I don't want it on HBO as I want the best quality possible and want a disc release to go with my other DCEU film releases.  I feel if it gets dumped to HBO Max, people valuing streamed media less means more piracy. Also, I'm in the UK, and if it's an HBO Max exclusive and I can't get HBO Max, I will be pirating it until it comes out on blu-ray. (Or in theaters, but that's much less likely.)",1
"calling it now, a rated R Spider Jerusalem origin movie.",1
"And let's be real, there's no way the Burton Batman *wouldn't* know how flat-out shackling Joker to a statue while he hangs from a helicopter is gonna end.",2
Oh yeah. Couldn't stand being owned epic style bro 😭😭😭  /s lol,1
Not petty. Just stating fact. Sorry you are upset about it. Deadline gets plenty of things wrong still.,0
It's becoming a fucking circus at this point. First Starfire (Titans) & now Babs lmao  PS: Casting a Latina as Starfire would've been more than acceptable.,1
"If this was all on the studio pushing a sequel, I would be very wary. However, given both Phillips & Phoenix have been talking up a sequel, I am much more into it.  As for other films, that is something I am completely onboard for. Luthor would seem like an obvious choice and could make for an interesting companion piece to Joker. Luthor's rich & powerful POV to Joker's poor and powerless POV.",1
Sweet! Was just wondering when this would drop.,1
Huh? I don’t know what you’re trying to say.,0
" >Honestly i don see the issue with this whole thing. You are damn way nitpicky on this  Not nitpicky. Just trying to analyse why a lot of people found the death pretty pointless and uninspiring. And making it look like he didn't even need to sacrifice himself doesn't help to make people buy into it. If we actually saw superman having to make a meaningful choice then people might not have found the death so hollow.  >Plus superman did see wonder woman is down when doomsday blast her away for good 40 second or so before superman went on to take a spear  There's no sense of him seeing any of that. Or any sense that she's in anyway significantly incapacitated by it either. We've seen her smashed across the battlefield and laugh it off like it's nothing and then chop off Doomsdays arm *without* the use of kryptonite. Are you going to argue that Superman saw something *we* didn't see, (wonder actually struggling), but didn't see something we saw, (Wonder Woman being able to inflict heavy damage)?",1
BTAS Harley will always be my favorite.,3
I do....... he was shown footage.  He was given evidence that lead him to change his mind and know the level of the film’s completion.     He was shown it. Meaning his knowledge is now first hand knowledge.   Jay oliva gave him a first hand account of behind the scenes drama.   See what im getting at?,2
Know what exactly? Grace doesn’t know shit,2
also cleavage,1
I have no idea how you could see any good in that movie. It’s horrible.,0
Well that makes sense!,2
>Leto is DCEU Joker.  That does not mean he is going to get a new movie. I think it's very unlikely that they are going to do anything else with his version of the character. He was set up as a supporting character for Harley Quinn. Their story is done.,1
What shit did she pull?,1
"Some people blame Whedon for it, but to me he was a hired gun. Any director who stepped in was in a bad spot. There was no way he’d make a high quality movie with the short time allowed for the reshoots.  Obviously if they delayed the release, the theatrical cut would have been better.",3
The day people understand that not all superhero movies have to be Marvel ( At leats 15 out of those 22 movies were unnecessary ) will be the day that the DC universe will really take off.,0
"You doing the equivalent of ""na na na na boo boo, I can't hear you"" right now. You keep claiming things are not what they are, simply because it's not what you want to believe.   > Comparative to the hundreds of thousands of people that enjoyed Batman on BvS  Yes, because hundreds of thousands of people did not enjoy the Dark Knight or Dark Knight Rises. C'mon man. And the Keaton Batman films are iconic, and both set box office records when they were released.   I understand that you love Batfleck, but you are in denial about how other people perceive the character, and you're also in denial about how people perceive the prior Batmen, clearly.",1

"Cause it looks friggin' cool, that's why.",1
"Well, in his defense he did say he was still trying to work it out. It’s unfair to think it would have been literal clicks and squeaks. It also wouldn’t be the first time Zack’s not doing the greatest job of trying to explain something on Vero.",0

"Matt Reeves and Robert Pattinson have a troubled relationship on the set of the upcoming DC Comics movie ""The Batman"", sources with knowledge of the situation have exclusively told Variety.

Sources also claim that Reeves might be considering recasting the Batman part with his original pick for the role, Kim Kardashian.",3
Citizen Kane with House of Cards elements,1
i hate wb,2
They're leading up to it for Shazam 3,1
You're missing the point. WB should stop hiding behind nameless and faceless sources and just man up and say it not coming if they have no plans,1
I’m fine with Eisenberg as Luthor he just needs to be written better. He’s also primed to be ruthless Luthor we were hoping for.   If they were to recast then Corey Stoll was always my main pick.,2
"I'll admit, the film version looks much better conpared to the HBO version, but I think that's the point. The HBO version feels more gritty, depressing, and realistic, since these are normal people creating their own costumes. The film version is extremely faithful and vibrant with colors, but almost feels too perfect and well-designed. All in all, I think both the movie and the show did a fine job capturing the image and essence of the Minuteman, the film aesthetic-wise and the show tone-wise.",1
"I realize that, it's just nice to see which people in the business actually have integrity. Whedon is not one of those people.",1
read,1
"All the articles today was free publicity to release the Snyder Cut. These outlets can’t help to publish more articles about to drive traffic and get clicks, and it only helps the cause.",2
I on board with that too but they are using the Birds of Prey so that was my fix.   But a solo film for both squads and then an epic crossover between the two that'd make bank and do a lot for the female representation.,1
"IMO The Joker movie never seemed like an origin story for The Clown Prince of Crime. The origins of an average mentally unstable killer, sure, but not ""The Joker"" of DC fame. This Joker never seemed to show/have the maniacal intelligence that Joker is known for. Batman is supposed to be the greatest detective and Joker is supposed to be his greatest foe. I can't see Joaquin's Joker as being anything near that. A sequel would have to have Batman in it or else accept that he's not in his league. If Batman is added this Joker's intelligence level would have to skyrocket and it would drastically change the character portrayed in Joker. Joker sequel shouldn't happen. IMO",1
Don't like her lying ass,3
"Man of Steel was divisive at best, critics didn’t really like it, fans were split, and general audiences didn’t care for it resulting in an underwhelming box office. It *did* underperform at the box office. Doctor Strange, an unpopular D List Marvel character that literally nobody knew outside some comic readers, made more money than Superman, the A list, most famous, popular, and recognizable comic book character ever created. Freaking Ant-Man almost made more money than SUPERMAN.   The next film where Cavill starred as Superman was BvS. A film despised by critics, split by fans, and the general audience didn’t flock out the theaters and see it over and over again. General audiences don’t connect with Cavill as Superman. The film was a mess and derailed the DCEU.    Next up? Justice League. And we all know how that went.    So if I’m WB, why would I put another $230 million into a Cavill led Superman flick when there’s already 3 clear examples of why it doesn’t work? He has so much negative baggage with the role.",1
Agreed it is my favourite DCEU film.,3
"Ooooh man. I hope we get a enraged,slight crazy black Adam. With Dwayne doing lots of wrestling moves! Hehe  I'm not familiar with his comic character.. Is he slightly nuts? power hungry? Enraged?",3
"This might get me a lot of downvotes, I don't know, but I've always thought he'd play an awesome Joker, lmao.",1

That's not even a word and I agree with yer!,2

"I've never seen her in anything, and I'm starting to get concerned that almost every comment is about how she looks. I haven't seen many ""Oh, her acting was so amazing in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_...."" whatever movie or show type of comments. Almost every comment I've seen about her is either about how hot she is or how she will have the right look for this role.",3
There’s zero chance it’s getting released in theatres.,3
Not really related to the topic but..  Is there an app or service where I can read DC comics?  Since the DC universe and comixology apps/subscriptions are not avaible in europe :(,1
I'm not saying I believe anything,1
">People didn't buy into it because they're still hung up on the Christopher Reeve's Superman who killed but he did it with a smile on his face  Nope. People didn't like Routh's Superman either.  >Based off of the premise of the movie, there was no prison to hold Zod in. The phantom zone was closed and Clark had no way at the time to know how to open it back up again. The set up of Zod being purposeless and angry and wanting to cause pain to Clark for erasing the very reason for his existence is plenty of reason to believe he would lash out in a manner that would make Clark make the ultimate decision. It's a coherent story.  All that's there except the part about Zod intentionally forcing Superman to make an ""ultimate decision"". Yes his actions lead to that. But that doesn't mean that's what he was intending to happen.    >Maybe you didn't like the destruction as a byproduct of their battle, and there were opportunities to showcase Clark being shook by the destruction as a byproduct of him trying to stop Zid  If those opportunities were there why didn't they do that?",1
Ventriloquist would actually be so cool. I doubt a film about him would make as much money since he's not as famous as the Joker but I'd still watch the hell out of it,2
"Well good news is all of those are in production (except DrFate, who is supposed to make an appearance in Black Adam, so expect a Fate solo film)",1
Dont be silly.,1
Now get John Goodman!,2
"Well, he looked like he was wearing braces, so he could possibly be Kingdom Come Batman.... Or even The Animated Series or Arkham Batman since he voiced them both.",1
I'd be down for Black Superman tbh,0
I think That’s what’s going on too,1
"I mean...that was a huge reason why everything went to crap. Outside of character assassination they just thought emptying out the toy chest in one film was going to work out.   Batman v Superman could’ve been great if it had just been about you know, Batman v Superman. Why were there extended vision scenes setting up plotlines that had nothing to do with the main story? Why was Doomsday used in the SECOND film? Why was there a Youtube trailer showing the Justice League? Why were there like 3 different subplots?",2
"Why Oded Fehr ? He's not good looking, famous & Egyptian.Israelis & Indians have already played enough Middle Eastern characters.Stop interchanging brown people.",0

"I feel like the new motto at DC/WB is that whatever the creatives want to use they can use and continuity doesn't matter. The DC Universe is the DC Universe. You want to use this character in your thing and have that actor in the role? Okay.  Look at all the Superman stuff we're starting to get, shows like Titans name dropping everybody, Deathstroke being in several continuities, etc.",3
Zack unchained.,3
"Too be fair Tom Hardy was portraying a Bane who was not meant to be Latino but rather be of Middle Eastern descent, so I believe in the case of TDKR he was meant to be Levant",2
I bet you that Isis will be renamed to Aset for the movie.,1
"So what if they're over 40 years old? Superman '78 defined Superhero movies and is still looked back to for inspiration, and they had the opportunity to use that Superman for their crossover, you'd be stupid not to use it",3
"I don't think it will. Probably won't. I could be wrong but probably wont. Keep in mind a fee of Matt Reeves movie scores have gotten C's on cinema score. Lower than any of Zack's Films. Plus, I've seen his stuff, he is not exactly the best director.",0
"Now that Phillips came out and said its all bullshit, can we lock these away?",1
"Only Sadness is Cavill is silent and it feels like he doesn't care about us anymore.Which is surprising to me , I felt that Ben wouldn't participate but I was totally wrong. It feels like ""False God"" from BvS weren't wrong either.",1

Years ago they were able to voice interesting takese on topics. Now it's just a bunch of manchilds at a table trying to make the wisest cracks.  Their video's are such a waste of time.  Fuck Andy Signore but the channel went to Total shit after he had to leave.,2
She absolutely adores Superman The Movie and paid homage to it in WW. I think she would nail it.,3
"Yeah and either on Twitter or Facebook he tried saying Superman “never killed.” Then when people pointed out he did just that in Superman II, he said Zod, Non and Ursa were arrested in the international cut. Oh, you mean A DELETED SCENE THAT ISN’T WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THE FINAL CUT?",3
[Hope] It's all some people have.,1
Much better and Snyder didn't seem to really get Superman (imo of course),0
I’m sure he’s devastated,3
"Yeah. Like I can't stand most of Joss' stuff (Even Avengers 1 which I loved at first hasn't aged well for me compared to the Russo stuff), but Firefly is and always will be a classic to me.",2
"Bought it and watched it for the first time last week (I actually liked the theater cut) and even though I knew most of the changes of the ultimate edition, it still did wonders to the movie",1
How is this Cosmic Horror at all?,2
Maybe I wanted a reminder of what part of the film it’s from or maybe I simply wanted to know what it means. I didn’t know wondering or even asking something was a bad thing. Why are you worried about another mans comment? You made yourself a hypocrite once again. Keep making yourself looking stupid and ignorant.,1
"Again... If you want to trust variety, cool. That article is ridiculous and is just telling us utter crap we already know of. But you'd rather favour those than a guy who worked on the project and most likely provided Zack with some official story boards.. mmkay then.",2
Ben looks so bloated here,0
I’m sure this is your typical Mark Hughes bombshell where it’s 3 pages that ultimately add up to: ‘maybe WB will release it but maybe not too.’,3

The result so far speaks for itself,3
It's likely gonna be in ancient egypt.,1
Of course. But not the “final stages”. These types of movies are worked on until about a month or so before the release.,0
"What are you talking about Wallace and his Daughter being five feet apart? What is this in reference to?  I’m not saying Bruce wasn’t aware of the trial, But Wally’s entry was late. And as we see in the movie, Bruce has no idea what was happening with Wally. Even though he maybe be paying attention to the story, the problem is Bruce is only seeing what he himself wants to see. That’s his problem throughout the whole movie, he isn’t interested in anything that doesn’t either help him kill Superman or further justify it. And it’s also not ridiculous for Bruce to not know about the checks because Lex was keeping them from him. Lex intercepted Wally’s checks and then sent them to Bruce with the red writing to make it look like it was from Wally.",0
"Cool poster. ""IF"" (and that's a big IF) we ever do get a Man of Steel sequel, I hope that it's not alien-based, much as I love Brainiac.  I think that after the triple-front threat from MOS, BvS and JL of alien-centric villains, Superman needs to face an Earthly threat that tests his humanity.   Manchester Black is still my number one pick.",2
The show still has a big budget to the tune of 100M+,2

I'd like to see Clayface. I always thought his back story in the animated series was tragically haunting. I'd say it *fits the mold*,1
Critics are terrified that a comic book movie might win best picture,2
You know that's exactly what I'm saying? Can we not have both? And that's what OP was saying too. You got so caught up in trying to put me down that you didn't even realize we were all saying the same thing.  My complaint was not levied at the Snyder version of Superman but at the people in the comments of this post who are genuinely offended that Superman would ever be anything else.  You've put a great number of words in my mouth and I don't appreciate any of them.,2
It’s too on the nose. Calendar Man in The Long Halloween is essentially Hannibal Lector in The Silence of the Lambs. It’s perfect but just so obvious.,3
Reshoots and pickups are different things entirely. A pickup could just be a simple scene involving one actor like the scene with Swanwick turning into Martian Manhunter.,2
"**Note:** Boss Logic was also the first to say Pattinson would be cast as Batman, and he's got friends in the industry. Coincidence or perhaps something more than pure coincidence?",3
"Yeah, and this wasn't like lying about it on the press circuit to get people to go to the movie in theaters. This was far before filming finished and waaaaaay before the release and press tour. There's little incentive to lie like this - if he wanted to ""lie by omission"", he'd have just said something different.",1
Oh look. Character building and world building. All thrown in the bin because RUSSIAN FAMILY and HUMOUR.,3
"If they don't use that line in the movie now, I'm going to be very upset, lol.",2
"Again they didn't have to change so much, or they could have done a better job on the mustache removal, or they could have dumped the pointless opening which was the worst part of the CGI, and either way it's frankly not Paramount's problem.  This isn't Cavill's first big budget rodeo. He's fully aware there are usually reshoots, and given his love of Superman why would he grow a mustache for a movie which shoots the entire time any reshoots could possibly happen?   Unless he'd already been told that he wasn't needed, and basically had the okay to do it.  WB should have had a bit more forethought, before they pushed Snyder out, to make sure all the actors would be properly available.",1
So I'm not the only one who caught that!!  (Crying tears of happiness 😅),3
"Yeah. He also made a comment about partnering up with Bruce for something, and his ""R&D is up to all sorts of no good"" in his Friends of the Library party.  Which they kind of did... Lex supplied Bruce with the Kryptonite and information, and Bruce did the tinkering himself.",1
I mean we know Cavill is still in so we'll probably see him  Batman will likely still get referenced looking at Shazam and BOP,2
"I think you confused me with the other dude, I'm on your side lol",1
Really? Haha thanks. I wanted a really good name that highlights the characters I like and the things I think we all strive for haha.,1
Lmao an Aquaman movie where 90% of the dialogue sounds like this honestly sounds terrible.,3
"Batman is Arkham is a pretty common concept for a Batman story, certainly not unique to Affleck’s script",2
It will undermine everything they have planned for the future,3
What a tool. I don’t trust anyone who refers to themselves as “normal”,3
Not saying it’s literally a red hood. I know it’s a hoodie. But it’s nice to see the writers had that in mind before stripping away the more obvious references,3
Pretty obvious the first time,1
I'm positive studios plant these rumors ahead of time to see what the response is before moving forward with anything. I'll believe it when I get confirmation from WB.,1
Seriously underrated version imo,2

"> It is completely unverified. No one is saying it isn't  Would you not say that posting it here lends credence to the idea that you're implying that? It's a baseless statement that has no proof whatsoever. I feel that posting any random, unsubstantiated Twitter comes across that way, especially when you're replying to comments doubting the authenticity of it saying why it may not be fake.   > Steppenwolf's design for BvS would obviously of carried over to Justice League where he was the main villain. For all we know the figure could have been close until WB changed the design.  [The Snyder Cut Steppenwolf design is the same as the theatre cut](https://screenrant.com/zack-snyder-steppenwolf-batman-v-superman-justice-league/). The op is positing that they'd have made a figure of Steppenwolf in the deleted communion scene. Regardless of which version of Justice League released, it was always going to be a different design. Ergo, the figure would have been of an extremely tiny appearance.   > Irrelevant of Man of Steel Hot Toys, the BvS Hot Toys were very successful were they not? How many were there? 7? Don't you think in 2016 they would have had bigger plans until Justice League bombed?  Aftermarket on the pre-Justice League figures are, for the most part, around or below stock in my experience. I'd also add that the Batman v Superman line had a single new character (Wonder Woman). The rest of the line was retreads of proven merchandising entities (Batman and Superman).   > I don't think it's out fo the question they would have Steppenwolf for JL1 and Darkseid for JL2.  R&D is substantially worse for figures with unique body types that only they can use once, or for a single character. They have to know or be confident that they'd be sellers. The DCEU did not have a track record for good selling villains (Zod) even prior to Justice League, and Hot Toys' precedent in other franchises (MCU) would lean more towards the side of caution in that department.  EDIT: Also, where did he say he works for Sideshow? He links to their manufacturers page on Hot Toys, but he doesn't say that he works for Sideshow in any of his tweets or replies from what I saw. I may be missing it, though.",2

Fantastic. He's not out and it hasn't been communicated to him that he is out. Now DC/WB needs to get their collective shit together so we can get MOS2. I don't see why this has to be so damn difficult.,1
"Saying someone is bad at telling a story does not specifically mean they have to literally be the writer. Directors also tell stories.  Being credited with ""Story By"" does not mean that one literally wrote the entire story. It just means that they were involved with putting together some of the broad strokes of the film's ideas. Sometimes, it may just mean you had first crack at forming the story, and none of what you wrote made it into the film (case in point: Colin Trevorrow just received Story By credit for Star Wars, despite JJ Abrams starting from scratch. At the same time, not receiving Story By credit does not mean someone wasn't intimately involved with molding the film and its writing, directors often are, even if they didn't put pen to paper and write.  So Zack Snyder, who has a writing credit for Wonder Woman, probably was not the driving screenwriter behind the project. At the same time, Man of Steel and especially BvS were also partially and largely, respectively, his ideas, despite him not being a credited writer.  But what he did write (and direct and produce) was Sucker Punch, as well as 300: Rise of an Empire (writer and producer). And they were awful.",2

The Honk Kong extraction was one of the best Batman sequence ever. So James Bondy.  Also the ICONIC chase sequence with Harvey Dent And Joker that sees the birth of a the Batpod.,3
">I disagree. I don’t think Zod wanted to die. Dying because you want to is not “a good death”.  He did want to die. To Zod, Clark took away the thing that gives his life purpose. Remember that Zod was genetically bred to only protect Krypton, now that Krypton is dead, Zod has no reason to live.   His good death would be him being killed in battle, something that he'd consider honourable.    >and closer to what Snyder meant as well.   Snyder has already said Zod essentially wanted to commit suicide by cop.  >Zod’s only motivation was to hurt Kal as much as possible.   It was to push Clark to the point of killing him, making him suffer as much as he could along the way.",3
truer words have never been spoken,1
">Yet some have suffered for Cavill’s intense love of the gym. “I wouldn’t say we ‘worked out’ so much as I acted as Henry’s trainer,” jokes costar Ben Affleck of their time on *Batman v Superman.* “I really had to help him increase muscle mass—before my coaching, he looked like Gumby.” He adds, “In all honesty, we did work out together. And I *hated* it.”  Lol.  (But sad we didn't get to see their Batman/Superman friendship play out properly).",3
"Clark smiles throughout all the movies. He's just not playing Clark like Reeves did as a sort of goofball.  A thing people seem to miss in BvS, is when he's carrying the Mexican girl to her mother in the crowd, he has this great Superman smile on his face as he is reuniting this family.",3
Casting was great. Personally I even think Affleck was a great choice for Batman. They just didn’t give him a good script. That’s always the problem with Snyder’s movies to be honest. They are almost always Beautiful but empty. Gotta wonder if the guy should have been a DP instead of a Dir.,1

That's a pretty liberal use of the word bombshell.,2

It's why we hate that he uses ice breath without explanation or build up. Zack takes the time to explore these things so he makes the supernatural elements feel more real and almost scientific. They make sense in the narrative.   How does one hear someone talk under water? Breathing under water is fine. Just say Atlanteans' biology is different; they have gills. However sound doesn't travel the same way under water as in the air. As soon as you open your mouth the water goes in. Even if you could form words what will it sound like?  The aquaman film version gets rid of this by essentially saying, ""it's comic books don't think too hard or take it seriously"". That's the point. Zack takes it more seriously than anyone.",0
Oh true but my suggestion was more that it left before Krypton died and began upgrading itself,1
I still wish they would have told whedon to fuck off . They should've realized mid process that hiring another director to re write and re shoot another directors vision wasn't gonna work out . Especially when it's like half the movie.

Yeah this is super boring. It's just you throwing titles at a screen.   If you're gonna build a cinematic universe then you need to map out how these movies fit together and why they're being made.   You don't even have plot details...just lists of villains...  PASS,2

I wouldn't be making the argument if people weren't always asking why Superman didn't just give the spear to WW. *You* wouldn't need to explain to people that she was incapacitated if the movie had given us a half second shot of that. Like I said I wouldn't be at all surprised if they'd filmed such a shot and totally accept the logic behind much of the points you're making. But if it's not actually shown in the movie then I don't think people are at fault for asking that question. Especially when the movie makes it look like she's invulnerable and having a fun time.   >Also no offense i find you very arrogant when you dictate what is basic filmmaking skill or what you think is best for the audiences.  Okay. But at least I actually back up my claims with detailed analysis of the film that you, (some might say arrogantly), dismiss as ""nit picking"".   >Apologize in advanced if i'm being too harsh  No need to apologise. We're kind of circling the drain here alright.",1
"I think Infinity War was written almost perfectly. Every single character interaction and first meeting goes down exactly how you would expect it to. IW blew me away with how well it was a crossover between ten different sub-franchises, and how well it blended together all the different characters and the styles that had been established for them in their own movies  I don’t remember any big problems with the writing in Civil War. I think Civil War did a much better job than BvS of making two heroes (two groups of heroes) fight each other in a way that didn’t require either hero or group to be unheroic like Batman is in BvS  Every time I listen to Feige, the directors, or the actors talk about the movies, they mostly come across as smart, genuine people who are passionate about the art that they’re creating",1
This would have sounded great in IMAX.,3

We really need a pinned post every week where people can post these.,2
As if they actively tried to hire the worst possible guy.,2
"The original two-part Justice League that Snyder was originally going to work on probably had a cliffhanger. I don’t see this JL having one if we were going to wait two-three more years for the second part with other films in between.  Darkseid speaking to them could feel like one, but I bet even Snyder’s Cut ends with Clark ripping off his shirt to fly off in Metropolis...which would be better going along with Junkie’s score.",2
"Haha ironically there will be a point were people watching MoS will have never heard of Sears. In a way, it’s kind of no longer a product placement.",2
I am not saying that BVS is a bad movie but let's not down play the success of other movies. DCEU is doing fine post synder,2
"I follow both WB profiles and they are under the ""Followers you know"" tab on Zack's twitter page. HBOMax just liked the post.",2
"That would be mindblowing, but I doubt it. It's whatever version of Batman would have been from the Christopher Reeve movies, since they are both the Kingdom Come versions of themselves.",3
The colours are perfect. It never made any sense as to why his suit was almost black.,0
I know it’s just one person but I’m not gonna go see this for different reasons.,1
"Precisely. Given all of the complaints Snyder fans have about WB interfering in his films and mandating things, you would think that they would actually give Whedon a break. Whedon's mandate form WB, as well as his tiny and rushed window of filming and post-production, is an obvious nightmare for any creative. Whedon was not given a good situation to succeed at all. WB should have delayed the film longer, but got greedy.  And I say this as someone who isn't a big fan of Whedon, either. I thought Avengers and Age of Ultron were meh, and think the Russos made better Avengers films all around. But he was not given a workable situation at all.   That being said, it's definitely fair to criticize his decision to accept that mandate to drastically change JL. No one forced him to do it.",3
"nobody hate you because you stated your opinion, people hate you because you coming to this subs and telling the whole reader what your emotion toward snyder.",0

You do understand that WB's splits the profits on all of the DC movies they make right? They split BVS with Ratpac 50/50. You're  embarrassing yourself mate.,3
"Even though I liked MOS quite a bit, I’m happy they went with the soft reboot, it’s so much more fun (Aquaman) and creative (The Batman) now. And along with WW they’ve been smash hits so far, Shazam got good reviews as well.",0

>Luthor fight Superman in a mech suit  We won't be getting that in Black Label but I hope it happens in DCEU.,1
Technically Whedon is the cuckoo.,1
Well yeah that’s obvious. Lex is playing everyone before the movie even starts. He knows who everyone is.,1
"He probably should have just not said anything.  Regardless of whether Snyder was fired or left on his own accord, the point is that the studio used his tragedy to completely overhaul his film in its entirety while lying and saying its still ‘Zack’s Vision’.   They need to respect their director and let him come out with the movie he intended.  #releasethesnydercut",3
"I mean, I just searched it, I cannot for the life of me find a source that said they didn't need him explicitly. Just a lot of ""Henry was under the impression he was done with is role"" that means a whole lot of things.",1
"See, there you go agoan with your condescending attitude. I don't need to ""read up on it"" I know how it works.   If you knew how it worked you'd understand that it does make a difference, it's an observed fact that media representation changes the way people view things.  >So to say I need to ""read up"" quite frankly is rude and narrow minded.  It's not  >when in actuality the point is lost on you my friend.  It's not.  >No representation doesn't make a difference. Empathy does. Connection of human beings. Actual human interactions. THAT'S what makes a difference.  Representation leads to less prejudice and more understanding, understanding leads to empathy and empathy leads to genuine human connections. You claim to understand all this but you clearly dont.  >Pop culture is great but to say it will psychologically make the difference is not true.  It does, again, please do some actual research. Representation in the media forms people's opinions, and distorted portrayals form negative opinions, and positive portrayals form positive opinions.    >Not everyone is going to hold your hand and you have to make the friends you can and be the strongest you can be.   That's true, but when people aren't subconsciously viewing you as different, it makes it all a lot easier.  But again, I'm bored of having to repeat the same thing, please read some studies and understand that media does effect the way people see eachother, and why good representation does have a positive impact on people",0
"Not even just that. There are people who disliked his movies but thought JL was even worse because it was such a Frankensteined mess. The logic I occasionally see from them is ""Shit movie with consistent tone > shit movie without one"".  I mean, whatever gets it released.",2
Henry Cavill himself liked Bosslogic's post on instagram,3
"I know how hard doing the coloring can be, so that's some damn great work on matching the dark green/maroon from Injustice",2
"That’s true but think of it like this, if the joker is the villain of the third Batman movie it would probably come out in 5-6 years. That’s long enough imo. That would almost be 20 years since the last the Batman wen t up against joker",2
"Because Snyder never personally attacked people or stereotyped them for disliking his stuff.   Johnson subscribes to typical stereotypes like ""people didn't like it because they're afraid of strong woman"" and stuff like that. It's one thing to defend your movie by explaining what happened or why you disagree with the public on what they thought of it. It's another to act like ""no, you're the one who is at fault for disliking it.""",2

"There's been no word on whether or not he would be Clark Kent, but even if he was, it's the end of the world why?   But even still, people are complaining that steppenwolf looks nothing like a Kirby design because Kirby's work is so distinct and they didn't even *try* to use the source material",1
Having a name doesn’t either. And so far everything anonymous sources said has been proven wrong by named people who *actually* worked on the film.   ScreenRant at least doesn’t write whole articles based on what “an insider of a source of my grandma said 😲”. I really wish it was just a matter of what I like.,1
I'd be down with this being Shazam 2   Like Shazam and Supes team up against the Rock before we get more teases of Mr. Mind (It makes sense since the Magic Realms are gonna be expensive as hell),1

The BvS released in theaters is more Batman than Superman. The Ultimate Cut is pretty even. And its supposed to be. The name is Batman-v-Superman after all. BvS was supposed to be about Superman answering for the destruction of MoS and then redemption via his sacrifice at the end. The movie is dark in tone. By the end of JL we were supposed to get the proper Boy Scout Hopeful Superman we all know and love via his resurrection. And we did kinda. He just had a fucked up lip.  We still need a proper MoS 2. WE NEED A PROPER MOS2. CAVILL DESERVES A PROPER MOS 2. WARNER PLEASE STOP BEING DIPSHITS!!!  Its sad when WBs most talked about movie right now is one we may not even get. That says a lot about WB and DC in general.,3
Like Mamoa as Aquaman then?,0
Best live action Batman ever. I absolutely loved him. Very sad he won’t be returning. Would have loved to see a prequel.,2
Bale actually was in really good shape for TDK/TDKR just his suit had no muscle padding so it made him look a lot skinnier than he actually was. His physique in those movies reminded me of Neal Adam’s Batman quite a bit,2
"she, like everyone else, has the ability to work out.",2
He did get his movie destroyed by the studio too and I'd like to his cut.,3
"I mean, you can tell no one put any emotion or care into the reshoots. You can’t blame them, though, as it does look like they poured their hearts out when filming the actual film. I feel bad for the cast having to film some sham just so studio heads could get their bonuses.",3
"She’s very good in the second season of Big Little Lies but tbh that’s pretty much it, her career’s been fairly unimpressive so far. I’m a fan but it’s because of potential more than anything.",1
Yea. I feel exactly the same way. I'm sure I'll still see it in the theater but I have zero excitement or any real care for it.,3
"For what it's worth, Zari has seemingly been written out of Arrowverse after Legends of Tomorrow's fourth season, and we know WB sometimes does that to TV characters who will appear in movies, like killing off Deadshot and Amanda Waller for Suicide Squad.",1
Thank you for not being able to comprehend what I said. I understand it may be a little bit beyond your level of thinking.,1
"Darn, I thought this was was going to have new information.",1
"The fact that he put this up after Sunday's HUMONGOUS demand for the Snyder Cut makes me believe it isn't coming out now. Check my posts, I supported the fuck out of the trend like crazy, so I'm not trying to be a hater or pessimistic. If the cut is on its way, then stop showing more content from the movie, because now it's just a tease as to what could have been. I'd expect WB and Zack to be in the early stages of negotations with him, so if he's still doing this, then that'd be fucking stupid on his part to be spoiling shit before the movie was to come out.",0
"Lmao come the fuck on  Squeaks and clicks?! Seriously???   I’m all for the release of the Snyder cut just to get a different look at Justice League because I hate the one we got, but it’s shit like this that really affirms he shouldn’t have been in charge of starting a shared universe.   That would have been a horrendously bad and laughable decision.",3
I fail to see how’s that a criteria.,1

"I wouldn't read much into it.  Sophisticated social media management typically has some automation / scripting.  Since HBOMax was tagged, the follow may have been automatic.  It's reasonable for the account to know when / how / why it's being tagged / discussed / engaged, especially early on.  Reciprocity of following is one of the fastest, surest ways to grow an account... as opposed to sincere interest or sentient evaluation of whether to follow.  When the account matures the auto-follow gets more filtered.",3
"UE definitely makes it feel like a Superman film, but overall it certainly has a more narrative focus on Batman’s reaction to Superman.   The problem with the film is that we really don’t get Superman response to the events transpiring. He doesn’t get a chance to really speak his mind or convey his point of view.   Obviously, this was done deliberately to instigate conflict between Batman and Superman. So as a result, the conflict feels very one sided. So it’s more like Batman and the World Vs Superman.",1
Much better poster instead of mostly SHOWING HARLEY QUINN,3
That’s literally every third act in a comic book movie,2
Let's not blame Whedon. He was doing a job he was hired to do. Some of it was ok. A lot of it felt hokie. But its studio interference not Whedon. WB are the ones who wanted an Avengers League. He did what he was hired to do.,2
Same.  If it’s no worse than SS quality I’d take it lol,1
"Jesus, Zack must've ran over his dog multiple times or something...",1
"Considering how Superman is supposed to be the person that everyone should strive to be and his comics like to center around his humanity, I would love to see it in his movies. It doesn't have to be something as cliche as saving a car from a tree either. One of my favorite parts in All Star Superman was when he talked that girl out of killing herself by telling her that her therapist really was caught in traffic and then giving her a hug.",3
"I'm pretty sure everybody agrees with you. Keanu was in a great movie with a bad title. If that movie was called almost anything other than Constantine, I feel like it would have made a lot of money. But Matt Ryan IS Constantine. I don't think I can see anybody else in the role.",1
"Agreed. Aquaman did not feel like a DC movie nor did it feel like it was connected to the other DCEU films, it's tone was so different. It literally looked like it had the budget of the power rangers film. The other three are much better then this film, incredibly overrated film it was.",0
This. I honestly think WB has always profited so much off of Batman on film it really hurts them to show how bad ass Snyder continued his take on Affleck’s Batman and weakens the interest of the hardcore fans in Pattinson when Ben could’ve stayed for many more appearances.,0
"In their attempt to fix “mistakes” that actually weren’t there (ToO dArK, ToO LonG, ToO SeRiOuS, NoT sMilEy) they made a huge mistake, and they have to rectify for it if they really are the “directors studio” they priee themselves to be.  MoS and BvS made together 1.5B dollars and broke BlueRay records. Regardless whether you agree or not, the fanbase for both has always been existent and very huge.   If they didn’t like Henry as Superman, the Internet wouldn’t have broken in two when the rumor of him leaving started to float. If thwy didn’t like Affleck as Batman in BvS, I wouldn’t have seen so many people to this day praise Affleck’s Batman. JL Batman is a direct result of WB turning the film into something that it isn’t so obviously it didn’t get the best reaction to “ouch my leg hurty”. The fans are not small groups, the haters have been so obnoxiously vocal for so long they do seem like the majority, but they arent.   Zack Snyder was never aiming for Endgame levels anyway, he cares about the fans more than he cares about money. Endgame is a result of two decades  years of building up an event so important that next to no one cares as much about the MCU when it came and went. To say a movie must make Endgame money to be considered a success is very shallow.",1
"babe, wasn't talking about you ;) there are legit haters out there",1
Agreed. As a starting point there are some tweaks I would make but MoS is pretty fucking good. BvS ruined everything for me.,0

[Zack says not to lose hope about the Snyder Cut](https://twitter.com/kryptonscodex/status/1199359625025507334?s=19),3
"Although the Snyder Cut doesn't include the black suit, it likely was supposed to originally.  I mean, there's no reason for Cavill to tease that photo of it if it's not part of the resurrection plot somehow.  I don't think he would just do that to be a dick.    I still believe however, that the original plan for JL (before BvS came out) was to bring Superman back evil in the first place.  Hence Geoff ""Snake"" Johns saying we ""accelerated the story to get to the hope and optimism faster.""",1
"Why?  BvS tackles this exact question. Why does he have to be what YOU want him to be? Why is his sacrifice not enough? He gives his body, sweat, blood, and LIFE, but because the guy’s not flashing a million-dollar smile and kissing babies, he’s not good enough? You getting this?",2

"I would prefer the version from BvS... this is ofc very unpolished but I think Steppenwolf would simply look better if he was stomping around in something you couldn't tell was armor... or something that was clearly some kind of biomechanical outfit. The design here (as it is) reminds me of Zod's armor which also looked very over-designed.  The one we got however I would say was just boring to look at, not to mention ugly, because what he was, was a very big dude in a suit of armor. CGI could have done a far better job with his face (or better yet just put someone elses face on it), but I keep wondering why he'd even expose his face like that when he's armored from head to toe otherwise.

"This might just be the Batman fan in me talking, but I have to disagree. By the time The Batman comes out, it'll have been nearly a decade since we last got a pure solo Batman film. Sure we got little bits of him in the past few years (BVS, SS, I refuse to count JL), but that was when he had to share the screen with other characters.  I'm more than welcome towards another solo Batman movie, especially one that seems to be like it's going to be the kickoff to a new trilogy that will lead to a complete ""Bat-universe"" of characters if the rumors of what Matt has planned turn out to be true.",3

The truth is, they were constantly pivoting throughout the production of the 3 Snyder films, and that is the result. We were supposed to get a Flash movie almost the same time as MoS was being developed. But they put all their cards on Snyder. One person cannot do it.  Lets not forget, they only realize the potential when Marvel's universe started to come together, so they rushed it.  I myself wonder why some people are clamoring for a JL recut and none for the MoS sequel. That's what we are supposed to be bugging WB with.  What is this exactly trying to accomplish? They are on the right path now FINALLY. So they want to go back? When what was originally intended isn't even on their current schedule? I don't get it.",1

Mark Hughes was given the proof to write this article.   Doesnt matter who he is writing it for. Or who he is.   These are facts.   And having Forbes behind him in any capacity just helps it get out to the more mainstream audiences.,0
I can’t decide between 1992 to 2009,1
I'm actually amazed that TDKR made more than TDK,1
"We should consider ourselves lucky if WB even drops the cut on HBO Max, WB didn't care about your movie originally why would they care about your DVD collection on your shelf?",2
"Even though a lot of people say it would look corny, I really would like to see Clark doing relatively more mundane heroic acts like this. This is what I see when I think of Superman: a guy who even though he has so much power and could ignore what many call unimportant issues, is willing to step in and help someone in need because it's the right thing to do, even if it's as something as simple as getting a cat out of a tree.",1
"Journalists care about their reputation. Publications care about their reputation. It’s also probably illegal to just make up a quote, if Phillips wanted to sue.",1
Didn't Whedon reshoot the post credit scene too?  I read that they shot it 2 weeks before the premiere or something.   Snyder wanted Lex to meet DeathStroke and give him contract to kill Batman?  Whedon changed it to setup a Legion of Doom film?,1
Jay was in Zack’s corner since Day 1. He put John Campea in a body bag earlier this year.    https://twitter.com/jayoliva1/status/1137811781487738881?s=21,3
Superman always has a choice. He didn’t need to kill him. He could have imprisoned him thus taking Zod’s victory away from him.,0

"First we’re gonna have to see how good BoP and Flash is for her writing ability.   Screen writing wise, she’s sub-par.   Then again, a director can interpret how the screenplay comes together and interpret the writing in a serious manner...Thus, Andy Muschetti.    But JJ all the way for MoS 2.",1
"The thing is, Reeve also wasn't much of a goof in the first movie. His Clark Kent was a bit nerdy, but that's what Clark Kent was at that point. He didn't get his Pulitzer-winning, stud reporter make-over until Bryne got control of the comic. It was only in Lester's scenes that Reeve got very similar to, well, ReeveS (George). But even then, it never seemed like Reeve really liked playing him so unseriously. George at least managed to add some humor by kinda being a very cocky Clark. Christopher was always more in his element as an optimistic but serious Superman.  I love that BvS scene btw. Mainly because you see him smiling, until people are reaching out to him like he's a God. Because he doesn't want to be a God. And that's something a lot of Snyder haters seem to forget, Clark never wanted to be a God. But for whatever reason, the fanboys do want him to be an all-knowing hopeful God, and not just a person trying to help. That's the whole point of Superman, he's the most human of all of us.",2
Was that the quote from JLU?,3
"The difference between mostly complete and actually complete can be huge. Hell, even if it was 100% done and ready for release, WB could still say “fuck it” and sit on it forever.",2
What the does this post mean?  Batman knows Lex knew his true identity even from the beginning...   You guys think this pun was said by Luthor with the intention of telling him “I know you are Bruce Wayne” ?  Luthor’s plan wouldn’t have worked if he didn’t know who they both were. He sent Bruce those letters cause he knew he was Batman...,1
"lol MBJ pitched something and it went nowhere. WB just had a meeting with him. Thats all. And it says a Superman movie wont be likely til after 2023. A LOT can change by then. And odds are, it won't be Clark, but another version thats already been black in the comics. its definitely not that serious to consider it racist.   With JJ most likely working on DC and The Rock and the Garcia's producing a potential gargantuan hit in Black Adam and a critic/fan favorite in Shazam, they can coax Cavillt o come hack.",1
I think it ruins the suspension of disbelief that you need in order to enjoy Batman and Superman's secret identities.  All of the interesting development of Lex Luther as a character happened before the movie. He's the Villain! And he decided to kill superman offscreen!,1
They were both awful. Lol,1
Sounds like if it’s ahit the GL show could lead to a connected movie.,3

Furthermore pertaining to the SC- It's difficult to fathom that Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck would SUDDENLY come out in support last week and have this be the result. Plus Jason's enthusiasm and very vocal support. Doesn't feel right.,2

There is no leaked images, no confirmations.   Jesse Eisenberg said he had 2-3 scenes that didnt make into the theatrical cut.  But the details are unknown.   If it's real, I have a feeling that the Prison scene might be the most talked about scene just like the Warehouse fight in BvS.",3
Why do you hate to say it...,3
I like it. Muscle definition could be toned down (think MoS rather than BvS/JL) but other than that it’s close to perfection.,1

I would like the Ayer cut. If and only if its as done or close to as done as JL. I have yet to see anything that makes me think its that complete.   as much as I would love it. I am pretty sure the snydercut we will get wont work within the original 5 part arc. I would love to see that either animated or in a graphic novel.   But we will see,1
I only told you to fuck off because the fact that you were starting the aggression by being condescending and belittling anything I said and any opinion I gave. I was only pointing out my age because the fact that you were treating me as if I was a child who needed to learn things on and subject matter that you probably are only beginning to understand. I wanted to actually educate you just like how you were trying to educate me on something that you didn't understand. So sorry if you didn't like a taste of your own medicine. Oh I'm not storming off by the way understanding the debate and declaring that I won because you lost all relevance by referring to me as a boomer and by going and declaring that my opinion is wrong. The whole point of the debate is to express opinions so say my opinion is wrong automatically makes you the loser in this debate because you cannot accept my opinion was different than yours. Actually I'm not a closeted bigoted. If anything you sound like a closeted bigoted to anyone that doesn't share the exact same opinion as you. That makes you sound like an absolute of fascist and I have to have the exact same level of empathy as you. One model of empathy is probably much stronger than yours because I can actually understand the fact that other people have different opinions than my own I'm going to accept that but I won't go and claim other people's opinions are raw. That's the beauty of football freestyle. As someone that should be supposedly open-minded you should understand that level of expression. Unless you want to say that I'm wrong and continue to show your narrow-minded view on what all right opinion is versus the wrong opinion. Which by the way is a very narrow-minded bigoted mindset.,1

This is possibly the most badass women in the DCEU with martial arts competency that could rival the best of the DC universe. That ain't it.   -Cassandra Cain...I don't even know what I am looking at.   -Harley Quinn may have had a meteoric rise but the fall may be even more dangerous.

No because now it puts it on a different level. It should be treated the same just as everything else.,1

"No, I'm pretty damn excited as well",3
Clark Kent as a reporter that’s doing a story on Shazam without ever being seen as Superman would be so fucking funny lmao.  Have billy completely oblivious to the fact that he’s Clark Kent and he’s mentioning ‘being friends with Superman and knowing him so well’ and Kent’s just sitting there writing his report with a shit eating grin while he’s interviewing him like “this little fucker has no idea”  Then when he finally tells him who he is Shazam feels like a dumbass. That would be priceless.,1
I think the idea was to make him look like Darkseid since they’re supposed to be related.,1
"Rewatch the black zero scene.  The girl we are discussing that could be his daughter is literally in camera shot of Wallace on the ground while he’s saying he can’t feel his legs.  > And it’s also not ridiculous for Bruce to not know about the checks because Lex was keeping them from him. Lex intercepted Wally’s checks and then sent them to Bruce with the red writing to make it look like it was from Wally.  Dude... what??????  How did you write the first sentence then write the next sentence and not think to yourself, “wait, what I just said makes no sense”.  Lex was keeping the checks from Wallace, not Bruce.  He literally was sending them back to Bruce.  If anything he wanted Bruce to see it.  That isn’t even addressing the point mind you, that is if Wallace is making national news as the face of this Superman trial, how could no one at Wayne enterprises tell Bruce Wallace is sending the checks back with cryptic, threatening messages on it?  Like, Wallace was on the news well before the trial when he defaced Superman’s monument.  He’s literally on TV screaming “I worked for Bruce Wayne” getting shoved into a cop car.  You’re just making excuses for Bruce (and anyone who knows him that watches TV if he happened to miss that story) being completely oblivious to things that he couldn’t possibly avoid.",1

"Beyond the fact that Batman was planned far back, I can't blame them. They're just now emerging from a period of instability with several divisive movies that underperformed (and outright bombed in the case of Justice League), and Batman has traditionally been their most reliable money maker.

YES! So much potential.   Hopefully this means Billy Crudup is back too.,1

"Good, because apparently TV is the only way to get a Superman that stays true to the core tenets of WHO Superman is. I'm sure Snyder would have gotten us there had WB and DC not interjected with Justice League. I like MOS, was kinda lukewarm with BVS, and outright thought the JL we got was terrible (due to the reshoots). However, I grew up with Reeve, and I grew up reading the John Byrne headed Man of Steel comic, and my favorite show growing up was Lois and Clark, and then Smallville. All of which GOT the core of Superman. It's just a shame the DCEU never got to that point. Here's hoping the TV exploits coming up in the near future really spur on the studio to do something with the character.",0

They just want to make better, more distinct films.

Script: -Car color, maker                   -Weather                     - time in the day                      -Michael and Sam description                      -Actual dialogue between the two   Also the criticisms not about him being able to write or not it’s about being able to tell said story.

As much as people don’t want to here it the major con is that Warner Bros would be going back to Snyder’s vision. Warner has made it clear their trying to move on from the Snyder era.  Releasing the Snyder cut would be reigniting Snyder’s fans and likely cause fans to demand they resign him to direct more movies   If you love Snyder’s movies that’s great. If your WB and wanting to move away from Snyder’s DC vision then that’s not something you wanna do,3
"I could have sworn the description of the sub said “Your one stop shop for DC news and discussion, AS WELL AS PAST DC FILMS AND VERTIGO ADAPTATIONS!” or was I mistaken?

Why the JLSC crowd keeps repeating ""respect the artist's work"" yet spits at TLJ and on Rian Johnson is genuinely beyond me.",0

I suppose you don't think the Israel Defense Forces are warriors either.   Despite however we all may view Amazons and whether or not Gal was will be subjective but I just like to point out how Gal has served in the armed forced for two years as a combat instructor and interestingly enough she also studied law and international relations. Gal may not be the WW that Darywn Cooke had at towering Superman but she is very much fit and active but most importantly she has this aura and charm about her. Regardless of Amazon heritage Gal's Diana is a demigod so that helps explain any further suspension of disbelief needed to believe Gal can be as powerful as Wonder Woman.,2

Eisenberg sounded like he literally first heard of the SC at that very moment and was giving an honest, spontaneous take on the topic.",3
They also may not want the rights... haha,1
"The film WAS picture locked, it had ADR and everything. This we've known for nearly 1 year now. Cost WOULD be absolutely minimal to finish the movie. Less than $10M.  The release would not have any cost if it was kept to digital release (through HBO max).  Marketing would be the only big cost, to be realistic, but even then it's an alternate cut release, it doesn't need as much promotional material as the original release. So less than $10M.  And seeing how much Warner Bros. made from the MoS and BvS physical copies sales ($116M and $78M) - not even counting digital sales OR the BvS:UE sales - I think it's safe to say that WB wouldn't actually be *that* hesitant to spent <$20M for potentially more than $100M revenues.",2

"WB (and Geoff) were......pretty fucking dumb to think that they could make this work and Joss was arrogant enough to think he could do it.  Some movies can pull it off depending on scale and how much, like a World War Z or Rogue One, but to change the whole film from tone to script...I mean....well you end up with a film like Solo (sorry Solo fans) which felt dull, uninspired and color by numbers.  But.....even if we do get the Snyder cut so much of it was truncated and changed in production it will likely still feel off kilter.",3
">WB and DC also believe that any of these villains could headline their own spinoff movies  Oh this is what we're doing now huh? Okay.   It would also be nice if these trades could stop saying ""WB and DC"" because i'm certain DC has next to no say in any of the creative or business decisions with these movies.",1
"No thank you. I don't mind MoS, but I feel someone else could do a better job of understanding what the character means. Given their success together with MI: Fallout (which also caused a lot of the mess for Cavil in JL), I think Chris McQuarrie would be a great choice to continue Clark's story whilst bringing the character in a new direction. He's specifically said that he's interested in doing it, with Henry. They even pitched a MoS 2 idea to WB which was turned down.   In my crazy mind, I think WB is still bitter at Paramount/McQuarrie for getting them into the whole mustache fiasco in the first place and that's the reason it was turned down. Could also be that it wasn't a good idea.",3

He wants it to come out but has no clout of his own so he keeps trying to use the fanbase to get WB to release it. They have no desire or incentive to release it because they movie bombed and they ain't spending more money on that.  The situation is as obvious as it gets.,2

"That sounds like a Superman movie. Nothing is too big or too small for Superman. From stopping Brainiac from capturing a city, to helping a lost child at a mall or, as you said, getting a cat from a tree. I'd like to watch or read Superman save a cat from a tree and most people would.  &#x200B;  As for the American Way part. what comics, and I know this an absurd idea because you don't read comics, have you read these days where Superman rejects Truth, Justice, and the American Way? The closest is when he threw away his citizenship, but they ignore that and today very fucking day, Supes fight to American ideals.  I would recommend you read What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and the American Way or Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow, both of which were written for people such as yourself. And if you want an angry, self loathing, sad, violent Superman, there are hundreds of incredibly repetitive Superman analogue comics that cover that such as Invincible, Sentry, and  Irredeemable to name a few. Fuck, Invincible gets a TV show next year, so you don't even have to read the books.",2

Again it comes back to an issue I had with BVS and I'll probably have with the Snyder Cut when it releases. Putting shit in the movie is fun but If it has no reason to be there don't use it   Vulko would be little more then fanservice/buildup for Aquaman that would be contradicted anyway",1

"The poor DCEU. Batman is gone, so they can’t do another JL, and they’re rebooting Batman with a young, relatively fresh Bruce, compared to the older, experienced Batfleck. So they can’t just pretend he’s the same person and just continue JL. So do they reboot it? Or do they just let it be and not do another JL? Or do they pretend Batman retired and still do team ups like Shazam and Superman vs Black Adam? And then new Batman is just on his own in a different universe?",1

"Dude, Mankiewitz (Who wrote the Donner movie) literally calls his script a Jesus allegory. Singer was way more blatant with it than anyone. Hell, there's more Plato's *The Republic* symbolism in MoS and BvS than there is Christ metaphors.     If you count all the Superman stories released before Death of Superman INCLUDING Pre-Crisis stuff which is not only non-canon to Death of Superman, but was also a massively different characterization of Superman, then you can count every live action Superman for BvS. Otherwise, you can only count Post-Crisis stories.     Dude, we see the dirt rise from Clark's grave, we knew he was gonna come back. It's like the deaths in Infinity War, more important for how it changes the people around them than for the death itself. Not to mention, you say we don't know this Superman, I call BS. We've had an entire movie of getting to know him and seeing his struggle with his destiny, and we've had a whole movie about Clark's significance and how he deals with it. I agree with you with the TC of BvS, but in the UE I did care. I cared because this was a Clark I related to. Not some perfect being who just smiles and solves everything, a human being with complex emotions. I know more about this Clark than any other Superman in history besides Reeve. He's a hell of a lot more human than George or Dean. Hell, in many ways he reminds me of Weiling. Look, if you weren't invested enough in the movies to really see what this Clark was like, fine. You have the right to not be invested. But to claim that we don't know this Superman when clearly there's just as many people invested in this Superman as any other is just flat out wrong.",1
kinda looks like he's wearing a diaper :/,0
"Because the whole point in marketing is to sell the movie. You put a bunch of superheroes people at least vaguely recognize on the poster, that’s fine. Put up a poster that looks like a sample size from a local night club and expect people to be excited, that’s not. It’s why you didn’t see Avengers or Justice League posters with the cast in casual clothes just standing around. Their job is to sell me on spending money to see the movie. I’m a huge comic fan. It doesn’t take much. They haven’t done that with what they’ve shown so far.",2

Flash's logo is so simple. It's not that hard to think Lex would use lightning for a super speed metahuman. Cyborg's is the hardest tp justify, but again I don't it's that crazy that Lex would use a c for Cyborg, which Vic literally is by definition of the word not just his super hero name.   EDIT: Others have pointed out that Flash was also active so his Logo existed already as well",3
"Maybe it's just me but this article doesn't fill me with any excitement. It's a lot of retreading what we already know which is meh. The only new news of any note is a renewed focus on Green Lantern which is promising. Everything else though is just stuff we already know that does nothing for me. I know it's just a pitch by Michael B. Jordan but I hope we don't lose Cavill as Superman. Not interested in BOP or SS2 but The Trench sounds like a cool horror type movie they could put on HBO Max. The HBO Max stuff is the most interesting thing in the article to me. If they focus on character driven movies with less mainstream heroes, that could be great. Prioritising story over spectacle.",1
"Mostly agreed except for Ant-Man 1. 2 is correct though.  Cavill AND Superman deserve one great movie. The comic book movie that doesn’t come very often. They deserve the Dark Knight/Logan/Spider-Man 2 treatment, where they give them something special and maybe even academy award worthy. Cavill is the dude to carry it.",1
"I'm curious if Danny Elfman was actually forced on Joss for both movies now that you've said it like that (Especially because the Elfman Justice League theme and his ""New"" version of the Avengers Theme that was never used again sound very similar).  Not to disrespect Elfman, but I'll take Silvestri and Junkie over him any day.  But in Justice Leagues case they were probably trying to pull that John Williams shit where they recycle that music people like. ""People like Elfman's Batman theme, and Williams Superman March, so put them in.""  Superman Returns also did that and it took attention away from John Ottmans score.",2

"Do a flash movie and then a flashpoint sequel that allows Robert Pattinson to be in the movie universe moving forward, start a new Superman trilogy with Cavill thats a few years after Justice league in a universe after flashpoint.  It can be a soft reboot for him and he can be established already, build out the regular cast of superman characters like Supergirl, Connor and/or Jon, recast Lex (explain it as a flashpoint thing if you want).  Not many better ways I can think of to course correct this unless they wanna build to a crisis but I feel that can be saved for down the road.  No reboots please. Fans don't need reboots. People know these characters enough they dont need more origins. Marvel has shown how much more fun these movies get when things are more established and the universe is built.",1

While not saying ultimate cut is pure perfection (but definitely a film i can get behind and actually enjoy) it's the movie people were meant to see and didn't. Thanks to WB again.... I think if studio would just let Zack do his thing, the results would be completely different. Oh and we got Doomsday also because of the studio, just btw....",2

I'd go Woody Harrelson,1
"Unless this is told as a flashback on the Joker film, that would be wasting a lot of time for a cameo.  I’d like for it to be like in the comics and leave it ambiguous. Like we see a goon falling down the chemicals fighting Batman, but it’s never confirmed whether that’s the Joker or not.",1
"I'm surprised you didnt get the role in the new Joker film, you've got the clown act nailed perfectly",1
">It’s exactly the same thing.  You did, when they are clearly not. The fact you needed that explaining to you tells me you probably do struggle to understand the creative comprehension that Snyder's capable of giving.  If you think they're shit, stick to marvel. Pretty simple.",1

"Exactly! He went from ""This. Is. Spartaaaaa!"" To ""Marthaaaaaaaa!""  All I see on this sub is Snyder this and Snyder that, if he was so good then why did his movies not do so well? Not just by the mainstream standards but actually by people who love comic books. I honestly don't know many people who are true comic book fans that enjoyed BvS.   When it first came out and people bashed it, I defended it (because it was DC and Batman is my favorite character) but looking back on it, it was a pile of hot garbage.   They keep saying ""he did such a great job with Watchmen"" but let's face it most of it was taken straight out of the book. Line for line out of the book, things that weren't from the book didn't fit in. He made Night Owl and Jupiter some crazy athletic, super strength having heroes, when they weren't.",1
"I don't understand WB's logic. They didn't have faith in this movie so they only paid 20-30mil which was half the budget. Now, Joker is over a billion and the top rated r movie box office wise. He hit Nolan status. He deserves the chance to work on any of the villains. Besides, they're going to be elseworld movies, so what is the problem?",1
I say a good villain origin movie would be Mr Freeze.  I could totally see it.,1
"Your mindset is problematic. Plus when you overuse the historical drop and dont look at the bigger profit and the long game instead of just using the party line. And no one is treating rhe characters he was using with respect anymore.  We have fucking Pattinson as Batman man which is a disgrace, and it's going to be a rehash of the younger years which NO ONE wants to see anymore. We get it . We know Batman has an origin or eselt years. Give us the experienced Batman. Stop building him up all the time. Just have him be Batman. Superman has been sidelined for now. Flash has been delayed mostly due to studio problems as well as Ezra being super busy. Harley Quinn is getting overused. Wonder Woman 84 sounds like its going to be Superman 4 quality and no Justice League. Sounds like the characters that you are loyal to aren't getting the justice they deserve. What about Nightwing or Deathstroke, they had directors and everything? Nope, let's do s Joker film for some reason. Batman vs Deathroke on an Arkham Style? Nope let's just rehash the early years again to try and recreate Nolan 2.0. Green Lantern is MIA.  All these we were going to get and we wouldve gotten becusee Justice League was going to open the doors but WB was too shortsighted to see the profit they would gained from the franchises they could've made that he was opening up.

Sea animals communicate through clicks and the like so of course he’d consider it. Would he go through with it? Most likely not. So given he was trying to ground this world in a reality much like our own, of course he’d consider this rather than just having them talk underwater. Wan did good, going with his gut and it works but don’t sit there as if this is justification for Snyder leaving the project. You just look even more desperate.",0

">I get bummed over people getting irritated about an interpretation of a character. Why does the movie version have to have the exact origin as the original comic?   Because these are iconic figures with clearly defined origins that set them on a certain path, and people care about these characters.  >Snyder clearly likes the Frank Miller shit and I can’t fault him for that. It rocks. Surely you know as well as I do that character traits change, especially over 80 years.   I agree, TDKR was awesome. It's an interesting take on a Batman who's been worn down after 30+ years as a vigilante in a world that's moved on from him. But when you start a new universe, you need to start from zero. In BvS, they gave us a Batman at the end of his journey. Literally every major storyline and character that shaped and defined him is in the past, all off-screen, and all we get is vague hints about it. BvS single-handedly torpedoed our chances of ever seeing like, 15 huge arcs from Batman & Superman's histories.  Yes, characters can change over time, but we didn't get to see that with Superman and Batman because Warner wanted a fat payday without doing any of the necessary legwork. Snyder is so obsessed with ""deconstruction"" that he forgot that you need to *construct* a thing before you can tear it down. The most successful DCEU movies so far have been Shazam, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman. Not surprisingly, they're the ones that all start the characters from as close to zero as possible and do a traditional origin story with a fleshed-out arc, not just a bunch of crap slammed together to look edgy and cool while requiring the audience's knowledge of TDKR, Death In The Family, etc. to fill in the blanks that they didn't feel like going over.  >Why is it so difficult to picture the DCEU as an Elseworlds story? Doing something different with the characters such as mixing and matching traits that you enjoy but recognize might be controversial, is a bold move.  No, it's not. Not for DC. They've taken to using ""eLsEwOrLdS"" to hand-wave their various fuck-ups and creative laziness for a while now and I'm sick of it. Marvel is only now - 10 years and 24 movies in - starting to toy with a multiverse, because they recognized the need to build a coherent main universe first.   If DC had piggybacked off of Marvel's formula, we'd be a phase or two away from a blockbuster-level adaptation of Crisis On Infinite Earths. Instead, the movies are struggling to limp through a scattershot, incohesive Phase Two while the CW DC shows (that are borderline Tumblr ship fics half the time) are about to do a 5-hour COIE adaptation and you know what? *It's going to be fucking great*. Because, again, they laid the groundwork for it. They've spent almost 10 years introducing Green Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, Atom, Black Canary, etc. and sowing the seeds of this massive story that actually uses ""Elseworlds"" as a competent narrative device instead of a way to excuse some gymbro ""auteur"" and his mountain of failed edgelord bullshit.",1

"But with Rosie Perez playing the part, I just can't get see that coming true.  Her voice is so repulsing it ruins her acting.  Like nails on a chalkboard.",1
I'm with you on this one. Keanu did a solid job but that wasn't Constantine.   I can't wait to see JLD on the big screen with hopefully more R-rated material. I really don't want to see DC universe turn into a marvel-like kid friendly Disney movies. There is time and place for those but if they make all of their movies like that it will be a real shame.,2
"True. Even though I find Tyler's score to be more interesting than Elfman's (Ironically though I'm kinda mad they kept using the Avengers 1 theme instead of the one Elfman made which is easily the best track he made for that score).  Yeah. It's just not very interesting to just hear the Batman and Superman scores from the old movies here. Especially when I think both of Zimmer's Batman themes were better than Elfman's honestly (Which is great, but I find it better as a song outside a movie than as part of the score). And I still don't get why they used Williams' Superman theme when ""Flight"" is so underused. Because it's iconic? So was the 90s X-Men theme and none of the X-Men movies had to rely on that to sell themselves.  It's almost like WB thought they could just get people to see the movie on nostalgic pandering or something.",3

He's constantly being challenged and for once you actually see him struggle, yet he still overcomes. Why do you want to see mindless entertainment?. Superman deserves better. He's not a marvel hero that's just a two-dimensional character.",3

"It's without a doubt the best Superman movie. And I say that as someone with intense nostalgia for Superman 1 (To the point where I used to say I HATED Superman II for ruining Reeve's character. I still don't like Lester Supes II, but I got over the pure hatred I had for it). To me Snyder did for 2013 exactly what Donner did for '78, give me a Superman in a realistic world that I could believe was there. Reeve made me believe a man could fly. Cavill made me believe a man could *soar*.",2
"Yeah, Heroic Hollywood is almost nothing but clickbait rumors. They’ll report on stuff that’s true but after the fact, and then they’ll run with wild speculation the other 75% of the time.",2
"I disagree. I don’t think Zod wanted to die. Dying because you want to is not “a good death”. I do think he’s ready to accept it if Kal is able to defeat him though, which is different, and closer to what Snyder meant as well.   Superman wins because:  1. He’s been basking under the yellow sun for nearly 30 years as opposed to Zod who’s been doing it for like a few days, so he’s stronger. Zod is the better fighter, which is why he can make up the difference.   2. He still has a purpose. Something Zod clearly states he doesn’t have anymore. Zod’s only motivation was to hurt Kal as much as possible.",0

"1. You seem to be locked onto the Donner version of the character.  While that's fine, you can't say that Snyder' version is ""not Superman"" or ""not who the character is"" because that's plain false.   2. In MoS, Clark saves lots of people, and if we're being technical, millions of people.  You are simply misinterpreting what Pa Kent told him: he knows Clark can't let people die, but it's still a risk because of the burden our world will thrust upon a child who isn't ready for it yet.  BvS proved him right.   3. Clark was far from a ""loser"" before putting on the suit in MoS.  Farming to help feed people is not a ""loser"" job, nor is working on a boat, or in a bar, or in the arctic.  I think it makes him working class.   4. The ""destruction"" in MoS is not promoted as ""cool"" to watch, it's the sad consequence of two aliens fighting in the skies above us.  MoS was one of the only comic book movies to show the result of superhero violence, something most CBM's avoid.  Just like there is a painful cost to a mother for giving birth, there is a consequence to the birth of Superman on Earth.    Overall, it seems you fall into the category of not accepting that Snyder's Superman is a legitimate version of the hero.  It may not be your ideal type, but it's perfectly accurate to the canon.  Just because you liked Earth 2 more than everything doesn't make those movies ""not accurate.""  So your comment about Snyder ""not getting"" Supes is therefore invalid and not worthy of consideration.  You're welcome.",1
"As well as the people that do repeat viewings, most of which are the fans of the franchise or series.",0
"I’m aware of the issue with the first part, but again it’s all how you spin things. Lex’s whole plan is about controlling the narrative of Superman.   I don’t know about that second disagreement. Her death can make you bitter, yes. But her leaving you after losing your legs because she can’t or doesn’t want to deal with you? That can make you bitter because you’re not just losing your wife, you’re pride as a man and belief in love is hit.",1

"Lot of folks act like people shouldn't be hard on Joss but I think this community should bet disgusted. Sounds valiant to help out a colleague in the face of tragedy but everything he did feels slimy and narcissistic. If peter Jackson left during Return of the King and they brought in Michael Bay to ""finish"" the movie but instead dude decided to shorten the movie and make it ""flow"" better by adding 20 explosion. I have to believe that the artistic world would look down upon Bay in that situation. Kinda like some tattoo artist wont touch another artists work. I get that joss didnt have enough time, but why did he think he did? Did he think he was going to be the DC savior by pumping out a bland Saturday morning cartoon? Even the DC animated stuff is heavier than anything Joss has done. If I was already a billion dollar director I think I would be looking for my own project anyway. Narcissist for sure.",3

Because we’ve already showed how it makes sense, and you just came back with just “it should have been better and made MORE sense, and if it makes sense then it doesn’t matter anyway cause it’s still bad”.

I think it’ll probably be decent and because of low expectations it’ll be overhyped. I wouldn’t be surprised if it didn’t make a lot of money though. But being a Batman/Joker adjacent character may make Harley a big draw.,1
" >Hopefully if the Snyder Cut ever releases  There is absolutely no chance it doesn't come out, now that Affleck and Gadot are tweeting about it. That absolutely came as a result of WB telling them they were allowed to (whether directly or thru Zack).   Don't know how or when it will come out (still praying on it coming to theaters in that empty April 2020 slot, however ridiculously unlikely that is!) but it absolutely will now.  I'd also really like Zack to come back just to tie things off. If Affleck came back to complete his arc and have his Batman die or be Lazarus Pitted into being Pattinson, then WB would have fixed the whole thing for me.  Affleck coming back is obviously also ridiculously unlikely, but he clearly liked Zack's arc, which is what he signed up for. All of his misery on that press tour and his withdrawal from the role was all when Zack had been pushed out and everything was being rewritten to that mess we got. A lot of people would have stepped away at that point. It's fucking depressing to think a boardroom could ruin a movie like that, particularly if you respect those you signed on for who's vision is being dismantled.",1
I guess OP is a fast learner then...,2
Why would you want her to direct it? She’s already doing Wonder Woman. Let her stay with that character and get different directors in the movie universe. Another director should helm Superman.

"I’m sorry you just have to ignore way too much for this to make sense.  Wallace was literally like 5 feet away from his “daughter”.  Are they both oblivious?  I get it was hard to see but the details of the scene show how close they were to each other.  And to say Bruce Wayne wasn’t aware of a global headline about Superman standing trial and one of his former employees being a huge part of the trial is a huge reach and makes him seem oblivious if true.  He was already planning to get kryptonite before the capital explosion even happened.  Don’t you think a guy who’s been obsessing over this alien would be following this story like a hawk?  I know he didn’t know Wallace was returning the checks (which is also kind of ridiculous unless the trial just came out of the blue), but that doesn’t mean he wasn’t aware of the trial and the information involved in it.",1

I like to watch things that don't require constantly having to fill the gaps up in my mind and watching constant out of character storylines which consist of about 7/8's episodes to a season.   Imagine not realising Geoff Johns wanted to inject so much humour into early DC films that he wanted to make them like marvel, that he then suddenly finds success in titans??. FYI, I dislike season 2, I loved season 1, that is why I touch upon his inability to write scripts and screenplays as well as Berlanti, arrow is a hot mess and doom patrol had 3-4 episodes which were a complete waste of time, as well as the villains traits getting old way too quickly, it was so canned it was painful.",0

That's a big roll of toilet paper.,1
I support RTSC but yeah this title was a bit misleading,2
">Snyder has already said Zod essentially wanted to commit suicide by cop   “I wanted to create this scenario where Superman is going to see those people get chopped in half, or he’s got to do what he’s go to do. And I think Zod knows that. It’s **almost** [suicide] **in a way**, it is, it’s **like** death by cop, you know **in a way**. In my mind **if Kal has the ability to kill him, then that’s a noble way for him to die**. It’s like that whole ‘good death is its own reward’ concept in the movie.”  To me, that suggests Zod was ready to accept death, not that he wanted to.   But that’s my opinion.",0
"I suppose if one role is visual and the other is entirely auditory, then it wouldn't be, thank you friend you've given me hope (also didn't know Pat was the POTUS in BVS)",3
"If you try to call people not ""Real DC fans"", then that is gatekeeping. Also nobody thinks Supes and Bats are the same. If that's why you got from the DCEU, that's just straight up wrong. Superman was constantly trying to save people. Batman was trying to punish criminals. That's the difference. Superman is a defender, a hero. Batman is the Hammer of justice, a Soldier in many ways.",3
Lets be honest Wan wasted him. I hope sequel has a much more focused plot and gives more time for each character to flesh out. (Mera Vulko Manta can certainly use more screentime),2
"People generally have one track minds. I agree with you. If this is actually a planned line of films, they should be just like Elseworld comics. Hopefully WB doesn't just get obsessed with ""villain origin = money"" cuz then they'll feel by the numbers",3
I'll check it out,1
This casting was very very sneaky sir,3
"That design was inspired by the Red and Blue Supermen versions, which were recent at the time the movie was being developed. That isn't really an excuse, but I'm just pointing out that it did have some basis in the comics.",1
Like I said before. WB is to blame as well.,2
"The Arkham games nailed her look, and proved it could look good in a realistic way. I’d go with that",2
"Not to mention that all her costars in Aquaman banded around her and supported her even after everything that happened with Johnny. Fucked up, but that's Hollywood.",3
"To be fair Henry and his manager can say he is still Superman till they are blue in the face but it doesn't mean anything if WB resist making another Superman film or resist having Superman appear in a film. I mean he was in Shazam yet Cavill wasn't there despite the ""cape still being in his closet"" or whatever. He is basically telling us what we already know; he hasn't been recast but WB are being cagey with the Superman character except on TV so he may as well be out as Superman. Nothing's changed. His statements literally mean ""nothing has changed"".",0
"I like how by the end of Justice League, Henry Cavill becomes the colorful and cheerful Superman we all know and love",1
I agree that the first Iron Man is the best one of his movies but his character got better and better to me even though the movies didnt.,2
"I'm beyond confused, like Snyder uploads more and more of his cut as time passes on but how could they cut SOOO much from the movie we have now. Like Snyder completed the movie (other than cgi of course) but then when he left for personal reasons they decided to completely remake the movie???",2
"Superman straight executes Zod in the comics. Zod is captured, restrained, all ready to get sent to the Phantom Zone or wherever. And Superman kills him with Kryptonite.",3
"This is, well, a previz scene. He was never going to look exactly like this. That said, I still think the BvS design is the best.",3

*ouch*,3
About right. Shooting scripts are only around 100 pages usually. The only difference I can think of is the original Superman 1 script was about 500 pages. And Mankiewitz was literally called in to shorten it.,3
"they normally film these DC movies 18 months in advance...then they did reshoots 6 months before the release...and basically reshot a whole movie. also the movie is 119 minutes in length. im being pedantic but it was Warner who insisted that the movie be less that 120 minutes, in the belief that more showings could be crammed in if you could get it under 120 minutes.",1

"You're not starting a franchise with a 41 year old, you're continuing it with one. The franchise started with Man of Steel. Any movie featuring Cavill would be a sequel to that, rather than Justice League.",3
"They shouldn’t overdo it with all the spinoffs, but I wouldn’t mind cameos of villains for world building or future appearances in later movies. It seems likely they’re going to have a new Joker for this Batman series, so I think that if they want to introduce him, it’d be a good idea to include a cameo either in this movie or the sequel, and then have him be the main villain of the third movie. Make it so he’s already fought Batman at least a few times as well so they have some history when they finally come face to face, I don’t want to see Batman’s first encounter with the Joker again.",1
"Don’t get me wrong, that is clearly what happened, but I think in their head what they were doing was making it much more appealing to kids and families vs being as dark as BvS so at least they could bank on that audience and the popularity of the characters getting them a lot of money back.  The tone from BvS to JL went from “this is literally pushing the limits of PG-13” to “this could easily pass as PG”.  Unfortunately, my honest guess about Snyder’s JL is they probably saw a lot of the same mistakes they made with BvS and said “let’s just fork over the money for reshoots and try to break even so we don’t look tone death” rather than doing the same thing a lot of people didn’t like for a 3rd time.  In hindsight I don’t blame Zach for this.  You can’t hire a guy who makes movies with a specific tone and change your mind and do the polar opposite in the middle of a movie.  That’s like taking an Eli Roth movie and deciding to make it a comedy when you’re about to wrap shooting.  The *only* thing WB should’ve done with JL is reshot any open ending that impacts a character they want to continue solo movies for.  I don’t care if they feel continuing without Zach is in their best interest, but you can’t start a movie one way and decide towards the end to make it something else.  Changing the tone is what killed justice league.  I realize this is a total “no shit” comment before anyone says it lol",1
We need Henry back  can't have the DCEU without the Man of Steel himself c'mon WB do ur damn thing give this man his proper sequel,1

It's him making a choice but not because he has to.  >Dude we see wonder woman need to use bracelet and shield to block the blast. Sure we seen her survive the blast but unlike superman, she is down for a quite while when being hit by the blast.  1. She still has her bracelet and shield 2. You've just made that part up about her being down for awhile after the blast. Both her and Superman struggle against it while it's happening but then both attack *together* after it's finished.  >It is clear that wonder woman is not in the position to take the spear by the time superman flies around and it is clearly logical that superman need to take the advantage to stab him while doomsday is weaken by batman kryptonite grenade for momentarily.   Superman doesn't see that. And if he does we aren't shown it. So again we don't actually see him making that choice to strike while the iron is hot. The way it's presented he was just damn lucky to arrive when that was happening.   >I don really think this is really matter here since it is still the same.  You don't see how if the fight had moved to an area with a crowd of people in danger of being killed by Doomsday's blast would have made a difference?  >Also did u seriously think batman will be lucky to be survive again that blast??  Superman seemed fine to roll the dice on Batman surviving that very first blast instead of whisking him away to safety.",1

"The action scenes in the Nolan films are honestly my least favorite Batman action period, except for maybe in Batman & Robin.  Kilmer's action in Forever beats Nolan's action in pretty much every way, West's action is also better told and shown than Nolan's action.  I'd probably rank it as  1. Affleck 2. Kilmer 3. Keaton 4. West 5. Clooney 6. Bale",1

Things like his Twitter being located in Texas raises red flags, since Hot Toys are in Hong Kong. That's also ignoring the fact that this would be a massive line and out of the norm for Hot Toys, as they tend not to do villains that much. Steppenwolf would never have happened because he was in Batman v Superman for an extremely small amount of time, and they tend not to bank on large figures that aren't either proven sellers or extremely popular characters.   EDIT: Hot Toys probably won't touch another DCEU villain for a long while after how badly the Man of Steel line bombed. It's very likely they follow the pattern of their MCU lines and stick to the main characters. These types of leaks also generally originate from Weibo. Our first look at Endgame designs was in the form of censored shots leaked by a Hot Toys employee on Weibo. So yeah, no evidence for the Twitter op's claims, information is off, M.O. for leakers is off, and it's very unlikely given their precedent.",3

Inaccurate.,0
I disagree. Zack Snyder has finished the majority if not all of the principle photography for JL. Basically all Whedon had to do was edit the “Snyder Cut” but he didn’t. He did what WB wanted and made this dumpster fire of a movie. Apparently there’s like 90 minutes of Zack Snyder’s original movie that got cut from the movie. So basically Whedon and WB just said “nah fuck Snyder’s version were gonna do our version” and this is what we get.,2

"Pardon if I’m wrong, but isn’t Slade’s unnaturally white hair color a result of him receiving the super soldier formula? Maybe I read that wrong but I always thought that was it",3
"Lmao, what did Johns have to do with Suicide Squad? You Snyder folks keep changing your fanfiction and Boogeymen. Also, considering any Green Lantern movie would pull from his GL run, it makes sense for Johns to make it Also, what exactly is wrong with Superman helping old ladies across the street.",1
[My sources say that he looks exactly like this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/cmx-images-prod/Item/366084/366084._SX1280_QL80_TTD_.jpg),3
"You trust a celebrity media gossip outlet, than a dude who actually took part in said production.. what in the fuck is wrong with you..",0
Then*,1
"Not impressed from what I've seen so far. Still going to support the film, but I'm worried.",1
"Yo what if this movie took on the agenda of Terrorism and twist it into the story of Black Adam?   Like Adam fights someone who thinks of himself like an OG like Bin laden and commits atrocities in the movie, and black Adam turns heel and decides to overthrow him while tricking to work with him the whole time... and then  Doctor Fate and Hawkman get in the middle off all this mess tries to play the heroes  And then there’s also a love story going on between Adam Isis    ...Fuck it’s Scorpion King all over again...if you think about it. From any angle. No wonder they casted him lol.   Even if he can’t pull off the Black Adam character study wise, he can pull off the story action wise due to his charisma.   I can’t wait either way.",3
"Damn, he *told* that guy. Haha, that was rad.",3
This Batman movie has new Gordon.,2
"This is the second time I've seen this mentioned only in this thread, I haven't heard anything before now. What the hell happened? Did it turn out Dean is a sexual assaulter?",1
"As much as I didn't like Eisenberg's portrayal of Luthor (or, let's say, the way the character was written), I don't see the point of recasting him.",2
"As cool as that is, I'd want to see something a little different.   Apparently when Reeves was writing the screenplay for The Batman, he was listening to [this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4jEymilyF0) from the Taxi Driver soundtrack. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more of that flavor in Michael Giacchino's score.",1
"Honestly the performances in that film were incredible, and his especially.",1
When I heard the JSA will be in it. Thats what got me super excited. Now I'm even more excited with Dr Fate. I hope this all leads to a Justice League Dark movie.,1
Wow. Never seen that. Yup. That is the gold standard right there.,1
This man killed it in The Night Of! So yes!   The casting of this movie has been so so good so far!,1
"Agreed, and I've only seen trailers",3
"I mean, he was the first non-government official to know that we killed bin Laden.",3
"It was just a bad creative idea, to make bubbles. James Wan did the right thing.",3
Clooney would be a great Falcone if he hadn't already been Batman once. John will kill it though.,1
"Yes because as far as acting is concerned, Christoph Waltz can do no wrong",1
I still want that wildcat boxing movie for DC Black,2
There's those rumours where it's about a crazy business man who lives in a world where Superman is a fictional character........ cause sure.... exciting.,1
"Gal and Jason I think are the two big pressure points. They're the two biggest DC stars right now. Meaning WB can't be as vindictive as they usually would be. Leaving them only two options:  1. Continue to plug their ears and yell ""I'm not listening, I'm not listening"" 2. Release it  The former can't work forever.",1
"That was barely Isis at all, it was just some random person with no ties to the character. She was basically an original character, tbh she was part of why I dropped Legends; it seemed like her only role was to snarkily shit on the rest of the group  I’m not saying they had to stick to the comic-book counterpart, cos no one was bothered. But to me she was basically a brand new character",0
"Well Reddit keeps telling me Sonic is the best movie ever made because they changed one design, so that’ll *obviously* blow this out of the water.",3
Fate!!!!,1
Careful surprise dick isn’t always what you think it is,2
"Also, a senator tell him not to piss in a jar and call it Granny's peach tea and then he gives her a jar of piss labeled peach tea.  Oh wait...no that was stupid.",1
"Not just Zod and the Kryptonians in Man of Steel. They also kinda replicated that in Aquaman and the Atlanteans specifically [King Nereus](https://imgur.com/a/2z6Py49). The Steppenwolf in the comics isn't even that tall. Like Kyptonians, they look more like Humans with a few slight exceptions like Darkseid and maybe Kalibak. They don't really need to make them look like ""aliens"".",3
He could be really great if he had a half decent script.,1
She is just awful.,3
"Oh you poor thing show us on the SpiderMan doll where marvel hurt you   Comparing the last decade between marvel and DC , yes indeed having a plan has mattered   It’s ok if you want to be a fan boy though and think their hodgepodge approach has worked out",0
Not every change is a bad one. Tbh not much changed.,2
Out of his ass. His whole comment was completely unsubstantiated BS.,2
"One thing you will never get from the MCU, layers and layers of story telling",2
"Yeah she looks great, whatever. So would any other pretty actress in that outfit. She sucks and should be recast.",1
From the stunt team yesterday,2
That doesn’t only add to his character for you? We know Lex is a genius level intellect and this last line kind of affirms that he was scripting out the entire Batman Superman fight. Lex knowing Batman’s identity at the end provides that he probably knew it the entire time leading to the server hack etc.,1
"Yes, some red highlights would have been nice.",1
It was just for the audition. Pattinson said recently the new suit hasn't been designed yet but that Matt Reeves has the idea for it and that it's awesome.,3
I offered you friendship and you spat in my face.,3
"""Shouldn't we have a league of our own?""  That is such a Joss Whedon line. I don't even hate it, it's just so obviously him and that's why the theatrical cut just doesn't work. You can totally tell which scenes, and even which shots, were done by both directors.",1
"Batman was on top of his car for a couple seconds. I'm not counting that since there was no actual interaction between them (obviously Bats and Joker are at their best when there's a personal tilt to it and they're on the screen together for more than a few seconds). And on Gotham, that was just Bruce as a kid and clearly not Batman. I know you understood my point as it was a really simple one.",2
Calling what she did on Captain Marvel a character is being generous,1
DANNY IS THE ONLY PENGUIN,1
Actually the pic that Snyder posted of Superman has the graphics underlay of Steppenwolf's original hand holding him in his pained resurrection. So he was going to appear in JL. But was changed some time after pre viz was done.,0
Oh yea visuals are good,1
I need that 2004 Joker energy in my life.,1
Isn’t Grayson supposed to be drop dead gorgeous? No shade.,3
I can see him as earth 23 Superman but we probably won’t get to that point fr a while,1
"Ay man, it’s cool if you hold Variety to such high regard. Just don’t tell strangers online that they need “psychiatric help” or that they “are disconnected from reality” just because they don’t share your perspective, mkay?  I’m sure there are far less childish way to disagree with someone. You remind me too much of myself when I was first learning to debate online.   And I’m sure you or others would have said the exact same words in regards of the Hollywood Reporter before the Joker2 rumorfest went on.",1
"I believe Dr Fate, Hawkman, Hawkgirl and Isis will all be in the film. However the JSA and characters like Stargirl will not appear.",1
"At first there was some hope that he would be Batman in Reeves' film after he welcomed him on board and said he was excited to work with him.  It's been a rough few years for the guy with his divorce and alcoholism. Then the reception for BvS, Live by night and finally JL probably knocked the wind out of him. Remember that he got a ton of flak for DD back in the day and he was hoping he could get a win with BvS.  Man, Thomas Jane is my favorite Punisher, but not the version from the movie. The one from Dirty Laundry, which he funded out of his own pocket, was the bomb. Dude looked and behaved like a killer version of Johnny Cash in that one and he was one cool customer. It's also the best unofficial commercial for Jack Daniels ever made.  I know people like to say Bernthal is the best Punisher, but his portrayal was at its peak in the second episode of the second season of DD. After that and in his own show he was too sociable and screamed too much like a gorilla.  Del Toro not doing Pacific Rim 2 is something you come to expect from him, since he's very loosey goosey with projects. He's attached to many and ends up doing only a few. He was originally the one who wanted to do JL Dark.",2
Oh ok. 👍. Have a great day.,3
He didn’t waste him. He pretty much played the Obi wan part from new hope.,3
"So, I understand that GL yes, Superman no.  More R rated movies and also no Snyder Cut.",3
The thing about it seems to be that it's a fairly low brow gag. And everyone wants to pretend they're high and mighty and above such icky things.,0
"Personally I don’t want to see another Harley/joker love story bc it feels old. It’ll be the same thing as the comics and cartoons. Jared Leto’s joker isn’t that great anyway, cast someone else and I might be a bit more interested",3
Not everything is teams. Comparing is what drove things into the ground.,0
"I'm gonna be honest, i don't know much about DC or Batman, but holy shit Batfleck with a decent script would be glourious, look at that mountain of a man!  Sad how everything turned out.",2
She is telling the story,3
"Yeah, I'm sure Snyder would jump right on the chance to do another superhero film.",1
"I feel the writing was a lot tighter in the director's cut. Like, it was baffling trying to figure out why they cut the scenes that they did. Almost every scene they cut had crucial plot elements to them, and without them, made the theatrical cut a narrative mess.",3
"Yup, God forbid somebody points out thinks they don't like about him, you'd get called a ""marvel kid"" lol as if being a fan of Marvel comics somehow is a bad thing.",0
Something like that. That's pretty neat imo,1
"I am not being disrespectful to those creators. I was just pointing out the facts of the situation an replying to someone's comment. I by no means was insulting their work. And you need to stop taking by referring to other movies besides his as smash hits when they all have been hits in their own way, minus JL and kind of Shazam. Stop being a fool and take your Snyder bias home. Plus the theatrical cut of BvS was edited poorly so that led to a different movie then what people should've gotten and would've been differently received.",0
I just wish they made the live action films more like the DC animated movies. They all have great plots.,2
Grace Randolph fanatics are something else. Always giving her credit for doing nothing while ignoring the numerous times that she has been wrong about things. I just block them and move on.,3
He said a little bigger..,0
I’ll pay $20 for a Riddler one!,1
I really love the first Batman vs Bane fight in TDKR. Something about seeing Batman get his ass kicked was so satisfying. But ultimately the warehouse scene wins.,3
Yeah Joker was absolutely insane there it even had rises week to week instead of drops.,1
A film toted as a one-off project now getting a sequel after becoming the first rated R movie to cross a billion dollars at the box office?   This really says a lot about our society.,1
"That is grossly inaccurate. BvS is still one of the top selling DVDs out of all the ones you just made. Aquaman hasn't even made much in those sales. And nowadays the streaming and home media service is more important than every. Once again, deadline gets shit wrong and doesn't know much on actual gross or profits. They are just mouth pieces for other people. If you look at other sources, you know that I am right.  Sorry for pointing out how wrong you are.",0
Found it,1
Yeah people forget Zack made a ton of questionable choices with these movies,2
Hereeee for Amber heard Chi Chi armor!,1
Also would make for a good story when the people see him beaten.,1
Well he's not a man so....,1
"I didn’t say they are the same words, dumdum. “Maybe you don’t understand” also falls into the same category. His movies are shite.",0
I recognized it as Fleischer inspired but I cant say I loved it right away. I guess I got used to it.,1
"He is talking about the previz video. Just releasing the previz video would be enough for the Snyder Cut, but I think if they release the previz video of the entire movie, people will want the actual thing even more.",2
"I don't blame you, it hasn't released yet. 2 hour trailer has too many bad moment, don't try it.",2
🤞😬,3
"Luthor's upbringing was pretty grim if I recall.  I do love the fact that he became president of the DCU for a while, despite being a disgraced businessman with criminal leanings. Would today's general public buy a storyline that crazy? 🤔",1
Lol look at you go,1
"Disney remake, finally a good transformers film and easily one of the best comic book movies ever? Yeah that's competition. It wouldve still been competition if Captain Marvel was going up against it for example. Except marvel solo films wouldve been expected to destroy that competioj and DC had come from a bomb JL so expectations for financial success was low  >no one asked for?  This phrase means nothing. No-one asks for films unless they are sequels. There isn't some sign up sheet for what film people want. Never has and never will be a good point to make why a film didnt make a lot of money or wasnt very strong.",2
"Pretty sure Wallace said his wife left him after he lost his legs, if his wife died in the Wayne building, wouldn't he have mentioned it?",2
Would it be a cliffhanger? The script was rewritten to not build to JL 2 and 3. Seems like it'll just close out the loop.,2
"Great dialogue, just think it would have been more suited for a different actor delivering them.",2
"I mean, it kind of make sense. Seems like black Adam will be drastically different from a tonal standpoint compared to Shazam. It's hard to imagine how exactly they will cross the two as I feel it will be more in line with the serious epic nature of something like Man of Steel. Not to mention Shazam was nothing special at the box office. If Black Adam is super successful, it would make sense to pair him with a much more iconic character. plus Cavill is also an absolute beefcake like The rock is. Won't look quite so awkward with them standing next to each other. Idk. I ""get"" it tbh. But it would be funky to not pair him with his actual nemesis. I feel the best they could is to have Shazam crossover with superman and have them both fight BA.",2
Most people dont even know Jurnee and her last name isnt particularly helpful.,2
Goddamn it this is fucking funny.,3
Point is that there’s still footage he shot in the final movie.,3
Way too bright  MoS was perfect,0
Same. But I guess that's a good thing? Coz I'm more likely to enjoy it due to low expectations. Unless it is really bad.,3
Would you not fear a nearly omnipotent alien being?,3
Here's a 1080p wallpaper version: [https://www.moviedeskback.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Man-Of-Steel-Kal-El.jpg](https://www.moviedeskback.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Man-Of-Steel-Kal-El.jpg),1
Honestly aquaman is so fucking bad MoS is definitely better,1
"got no dog in this fight, but I read a few collections in my formative years.  All-Star Superman is, to me, a definitive take that encompasses all the good generalization of this archetypal messianic character; it's King Arthur, it's the Passion. I don't see superhero movies because I think capes are stupid, but I don't think anyone writing these films is really trying to say anything.   I enjoyed Man of Steel (haven't seen any of these DC movies since) because the ending made sense to me, when he snaps Zod's neck - our ancient tradition of the hero is one who must kill the beast rampaging through the community to protect even those who doubt his ability to overcome the creature.",1
If anything that makes my case stronger. Nobody cared about a Donner Cut (Mainly because Donner didn't have a complete cut until he came back in 2001-2006. He only shot 70% of his film). JL was more disappointing and people are more ardent about getting the SC (Which is complete) than they ever were about the Donner Cut. There is simply more to be gained in improvement with the SC (Even though I argue the Donner Cut is vastly superior to the Lester Cut).,0
> Idk why batman has to be a gigantic mass monster.  Cause he's huge and ridiculously strong,1
"It never gets mentioned, but I actually liked Price's score for Suicide Squad lol! I'm a bit confused as to how this came about too, but there's no way it isn't legit.",3
What's there to confirm? He's said that pretty much since he started working on Joker.,3
Integrity < Money,1
I assume you've had the same repulsed reaction to every casting of Alfred so far.,2
"Cavill wouldn't play Superman in that movie if it was only a cameo. He's already had that discussion with WB. He wants more of his own movies, and I agree.  You could do the modern Luthor origin, where he's from Suicide Slums. Set it pre-Superman, with Luthor's ascent to king of Metropolis, and feature a prying Lois Lane as his foil.",1
" Hark Triton, hark! Bellow, bid our father the Sea King rise from the depths full foul in his fury! Black waves teeming with salt foam to smother this young mouth with pungent slime, to choke ye, engorging your organs til' ye turn blue and bloated with bilge and brine and can scream no more - only when he, crowned in cockle shells with slitherin' tentacle tail and steaming beard take up his fell be-finned arm, his coral-tine trident screeches banshee-like in the tempest and plunges right through yer gullet, bursting ye - a bulging bladder no more, but a blasted bloody film now and nothing for the harpies and the souls of dead sailors to peck and claw and feed upon only to be lapped up and swallowed by the infinite waters of the Dread Emperor himself - forgotten to any man, to any time, forgotten to any god or devil, forgotten even to the sea, for any stuff for part of Winslow, even any scantling of your soul is Winslow no more, but is now itself the sea!",3
Unnecessary. Cuz no one would care. But he cared. And wanted it to be different. So I applaud it.   Looks slick here. So cant be mad about it. Can totally be mad about it in Josstice league,1
