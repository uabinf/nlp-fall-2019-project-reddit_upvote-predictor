Y'all got any more of them pixels,3
All these costumes look like crap honestly. Hopefully Margot can go 2 for 2 when it comes to saving a DC film she's in.,2
And The Kinberg Cut,2
"He doesn't break stories. He's mostly a critic and a screenwriter. But when it comes to the SC he's the only one that has actually tried to spread things Jason Momoa, Fabien Wagner, and Ray Fisher have said. On the SC specifically I trust him.",2
nope. dead serious question.,1
I thought the same thing before ‘Batman v Superman’ came out. Anything is possible this day and age. Granted I don’t think it will receive the negative word of mouth that movie had but still anything is possible.,0
"HBO Max is coming out in May, so if it’s getting released you’d assume it’d be a launch title.",3
"Both of you are right, stop being fucking stupid",0
*spits water* JJABRAMS?!!!,1
Sometimes studio interference is necessary.  Letting a director run riot is a stupid thing to do.,2
"Sorry,i am a bit uneducated on timmverse.is that the animated cartoon series?",1
Yeah imma have to call bullshit on that one,2
You aren't understanding my point. Having aliens is fine. Having immortal women as a whole culture is fine. A Frankenstein ed monster using an alien corpse is fine. It's not about the fictional elements. It's about the explanation and logic they run on.   Talking underwater has no explanation. It doesn't make sense. It's fine in anything else but in the DCEU which famously was quite grounded it's disappointing.,1
Yea I love him n dope.   He wants to play Miles in live action so we should get him in DC before he gets that,1
"I mean, his complete version of Watchmen is incredibly long. And with these movies he wanted to achieve a lot, and that requires a long run time, BvS was more than 3 hours originally and so was JL, he likely had ideas about what to cut for a TC but his directors cuts are what he considers to be his film",1
They pretty much gave Elba a new character *because* they wanted Smith to have a shot at returning. I think Smith returning is even higher than Cavill,1
"I think Johns screwed up and is paying the price. They gave him GL to write, and it's been years with no updates. It's still listed on his site but at this point I don't think he's involved anymore. Especially now they we're getting a GL show and he has no involvement in it.",2
Man if he is in it that would be awesome,3
I wouldn’t mind. It can definitely work but I doubt it will happen.,1
My pepe hard. I need that Deathstroke film like YESTERDAY!!!  #RelaeseTheSnyderCut,1
Yes he is. His monster is not.,1
Literally the same as previs.,1
"That should be the “sequel” though, not a Joker 2 but rather a “The Riddler” or something like that, perhaps in a different setting.",3
"Have you tried shooting laser beams from your eyes? Guess what, you can’t.",3
You mean the super friends?,1
"I'm glad, *Joker* was a nice, one off movie.",3
Yup. His speech feels oddly relevant. Fiery and defiant. Doubters stick to your word. Faithful keep believing.,1
VINDICCAAAAAATIOOOOOOOOOON,1
Isreali/Hebrew. Still ambiguous and can pass for white.,1
He can't break his NDA like Jason thats for sure,3
"False again. You said I insulted you, so give me proof. Where are the quotes. Where did I say you were sour or in denial in my original post. It's less then 100 words, should be easy to find.",1
A practical joker means he's a trickster. They weren't talking about the Joker from the DC universe.,3
"I think it was one of those ideas he had, couldn't implement, and would realize it was stupid eventually. Good directors can have bad ideas, I'm a huge Snyder fan and I rag on Sucker Punch every chance I get.",3
It could work. I would support it. I'd rather have a shared universe rather than just solo universes.   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,0
"They’re similar in the fact that they both wear a black body suit, which like every Catwoman does. The masks are completely different",1
"I want a West Open-World Arkham game so bad. If you stop and think about how much ridiculous fucking fun that would be, it's crazy.",2
If you just look at market trends it seems like there's a real obsession with superhero movies. Unless the film is plain miserable its likely to hit a billion just from current trends and inflation. I'm skeptical about the quality but it seems WB has learned their lesson lately.,1
🤮 🤮 🤮,1
"If this ends up being true, sign me the hell up.",3
Just don't mess them up like Legends,1
"Maybe instead of Joker 2, they could make a Harley Quinn origin movie with JP's Joker",3
"Sure, dude. It is just an opinion, relax.",0
"To be honest, I thought that was the Knightmare suit for a few minutes.",1
"I think it's less comparison and more ""If Thor can do it, so can Superman but in its own way"". Rebooting the superman character itself seems like a waste to me especially because of all the development Superman got throughout MoS - JL. I feel like it wouldn't be too hard to pick up where we left off for Superman because JL ended at a part where Superman can start new with his life, so there's a lot of directions we can go that isn't rebooting.",1
"He was ace in Chronicle, which obviously was a superpowers movie.  If you've not seen it, I can't recommend it more highly, at least for it's depiction of telekinesis.",1
"Which would’ve been a breath of fresh air, but WB wanted Whedon to make Avengers 2.0.",3
"Having the Atlantean’s speak a more underwater-ish language certainly makes sense (and would be cool as fuck). I definitely understand why Wan didn’t go this route as well. That’s what’s so cool about having different creators tackle the same IP, you get a bunch things approached in different ways.",3
I can hear elder scrolls chanting in the background,1
"I mean, if it's almost suicide then he wants to die, he literally has nothing left for him in the world, he wants to cause as much suffering as possible so that Clark will kill him. He considers Clark killing him a good death",2
"As is their right. Again, not their problem.  Edit: incidentally although they did offer to CG the tache back, MI checked and decided it would be too difficult to make it look good/realistic. Which is a fair choice.",2
a lot of the DCEU has taken huge inspiration from New 52.,2
But you’re just thinking about it from a records standpoint.  Does Wally have no friends or family that would see him?  Wouldn’t Bruce know she died?  Is Wally so bitter that he gave up his daughter for the sake of a story?  It just doesn’t make any sense at all lol.  If the logic is “because it’s Lex” than if it’s true it’s just a terrible plot point and it’s a good thing they didn’t focus on it lol.,1
This is such great news. For all we know though the sequel could be more of a retelling of a different origin story.. I mean this is the Joker. As for new characters.. Luthor.,1
I see your point but I think it’s all the more reason to campaign actually. And it’s a team effort.,1
I dont get brunch though.,1
Not shocking that its 3 batman related movies but if you told me 10 years ago aquaman would be the other I would have lost my mind.,3
"As everyone has said, it's about his ability to tell the story, not his ability to create one. Coming from someone who absolutely *adores* BvS, that's one of his weakest points. The movie could've been even better if he knew how to trim the fat and really streamline the massive script, making lines sound more natural, seeing what works on screen and what doesn't. Iirc for BvS he literally just shot the script as is. A director needs to do more than that. That's where the story telling comes in.",2
That looks so badass.   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
Omg i saw that too lol,3
I don’t understand why you’re so upset.,0
214 All day everyday.,1
In a twist the Court of Owls got to Bruce already.,3
"After all the money the joker made, it’s not gonna be hard to get actors to sign up lol",2
"That dude couldn't even stay in shape for reshoots, you expect him to get back in shape in 5-10 years from now?",2
Whedon reshot scenes that Zack had already done....for some bizarre reason,3
"He does though, so how doesn't he??.",1
Hes certainly talented. Definitely. Loved him in Rock and Rolla.,3
Bad comment,0
"> But now with all the pushing he's been doing to get his cut released and the gracious fans who have also used it as a venue to support and donate to Suicide Prevention, **Zack is also doing it for his daughter. The last movie that never got finished was the last project he worked on before his daughter died. And that's very personal and beyond the call for having a director get his creative vision out there.**  No offense, but this is very off base, and honestly is disrespectful to Snyder. You are not in a position to claim that he is doing something for/in honor of his deceased daughter. Unless it personally came out of his mouth, then it's a messed up thing to claim that on his behalf.  You are clearly a fan of his, and as such hopefully you can see why you making this claim is disrespectful.",3
"Show me a Superman, outside of a miniseries, that would basically level a city without a care.   Superman was in hiding. He wasn't a happy guy in the boat. He looked miserable. He was hiding in those jobs. I'm older than the average redactor and have been reading Superman since the 1980s. Outside of a mini-series, show me a Superman who's this morose, this checked out. He doesn't exist, at least not for long because that's not Superman.    Snyder made one movie that I think worked to his strengths. Everything else has been disappointing with diminishing returns.  That said I think Warner gave him a raw deal and the movie we got with Justice League was probably much worse than what he would have created if left alone.  You are entitled to your opinion but I'm not wrong. It's my opinion and I think audience and box office supported my opinion.",0
When you're WB and Whedon,1
Ray Porter was meant to be him in the Snyder Cut  Granted I doubt he'll actually do the role unless we get the Cut  Also you just reminded me of how much I loved Grundy in the DCAU,1
"Sinestros appearance is based off actor David Niven. Luke Evans looks like he could be his son. Spot on,",3
Man of Steel is genuinely great. I understand some BvS criticism but MoS? No way.,3
"Beautiful.   Just a minor nitpick: probably the best Batsuit but the cowl is one of the worst, specially the eyes (not talking about the Night Owl glasses) and how bloated Ben looks.",2
And you obviously didn’t get the context of this whole post.,0
I love Jason's expression during all this,1
He might have reshot the scene before WB's 2 hour mandate.,1
"The first superhero team on world technically. They have a speedster, wizard, lantern and etc, quite like JL. But I'd say they are not ""loveble"" like JL, I don't know if it's just me but still pretty exciting. (Except for Jay. I love Jay Garrick)",1
"Zack is like: ""If you called us pretenders then, call us pretenders now. Keep doubting. We want them to sound dumb in the end.""",3
"Of all the people, I really feel the worst for Ray. He probably thought JL was gonna be his big star-making role since he was an unknown actor prior to this, and things just didn't work out for the poor guy. Aside from True Detective, has he booked any work since then?",1
Yes. Do always base content on company.,1
"Hashtags, movie magic, and lots of luck at this point.",1
Who's Joe?,0
620 in this [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KQc64DQqqNU) to hear all the bs.,1
"But why be different when it adds no benefit, it's just clunky and gets in the way, the comics haven't ever really had a need for it.   >Can totally be mad about it in Josstice league   Why though? It ultimately did the same thing, made the scene clunky and awkward",2
"Not everything for sure, but Disney does. Disney is way left wing.",0
Is that Jeffrey Dean Morgan as comedian in coloured pic?,1
This dudes absolutely fuckin hilarious in Anger management 🤣,2
Who?  Zack Snyder?,0
x5,2
I just love the Dark Knight Trilogy so much...,3
Giving Snyder all the keys of DC with three failures and then removing him from his completed movie when his daughter passed away was the stupidest decision on WB's part.   And I think that phase is a big lesson and WB should learn to fire directors whose movies aren't working. DC's reputation is quite fragile one big underperformer and all the goodwill is gone,1
"Yes, I think the second part I brought up was August of last year, whereas Ben was ""officially"" out by January of this year. So it could be damage control, but I'm still going to take the director's word over uninformed projections. It makes more sense for The Batman to be in the DCEU than not to be.",1
It also completely and totally ignores Black a Adam despite us knowing for a fact the movie is coming out before any other “in development” film in the article.,3
"""If I'm going to have a past I'd prefer it to be multiple choice""    What if the sequel is another joker origin story but completely different circumstances. I'd watch a JP Joker origin story every 5 years if I could lol.",1
"Other than labelling every god with human features?, Which is what you're doing lol?.   I'm agruing that that is not necessary, clearly.   I provided you a rational point, where's your rational response?.",0
Yup thats what i was thinking. Can't underestimate clickbait bloggers and trolls though.,1
Save him for Atrocitus. Christopher Judge should be Darkseid.,1
"In a another world, he would made a perfect Joker",3
They don’t call him the Rock for nothing,1
I hope that every character in the movie will have justice and will get enough time,2
They're still in the final version.,3
"Objectively speaking, it has been confirmed to either exist, be mostly completed or both by people who worked on the film. It’s not a pipe dream and I’m tired of people who pretend it is.  Mark Hughes said it best in his article:   > It’s also worth noting that there was indeed a sustained campaign to convince everyone that no Snyder Cut exists, with some people intentionally spreading false information to mislead the press and public, while others spread the false information because they were misled by their bosses or sources and had no other evidence at the time to convince them otherwise.  Snyder posting completed VFX pics in admist of all the “it’s an unfinished pipe dream” nonsense is simply sending a message.",1
"God this movie is going to play out like one of the Transformer movies.  I'm guessing dozens of lines will be predictable, verbatim.      Bruce will be dark, solemn, and in search of ""something""     Riddler will have a plot, probably a ransom,  Penguin will have an even darker plot:  murder, chaos,  And then in the film's climax,  the previously immoral Catwoman will have a change of heart that will turn the tides for the caped crusader.  I actually want to vomit just thinking about it.  &#x200B;  You heard it here first.",0
I really enjoy cavills Superman because of that. We also saw him grow up and understand how helpless he was in that moment.   I think if we got a good backstory for batman that character could've worked too but without it people were never gonna accept it,2
"Im loving all of this, except for the chin, which makes him look a lot like Thanos",1
Superhero costume in a superhero movie ? No ? Only my me ?,1
This man gets it!,1
"Absolutely agreed.   I highly suggest 300, DofD, and Watchmen (directors cut) btw. All well done imo.",1
"Except Zack Snyder says Zod was doing a Suicide by cop, so he wanted to die. And Zod says either Superman dies, or he dies. If Zod really wanted to live and just kill people to hurt Superman, I don’t think he would have made it a point to say that.",2
"Well, The Long Halloween has a lot of villains in it.",3
Mixed feelings about this one,1
Nah I meant what I said. If Batman knew Superman’s identity he would’ve already known his mom’s name. Obviously after that scene he knows.,1
How are they not related when the mods here make a huge announcement about joining in on the tweets?,2
"""Retcon"" is the word used wrongly by people. Retcon is additional explanation/information added later which does not mess continuity.  Other 2 non Burton Batman movies are not retcon. They literally do not follow same continuity as Burton movies.  For example if we find out in later movies that Batman has twin sisters. That would be retcon. But it would not mess continuity if explaned why we did not know that she exist. But if they make Batman female without any explanation in future movies, that would be reboot, new continuity, not retcon. Retcon is always something explaned logically.",1
"Although I'd personally prefer a redhead, I'll trust whoever Reeves casts to do a fine job.",2
People have spent 2 years being brainwashed by character-assassinating bloggers. Might take a while to break the programming.  But I'm incredibly glad to be part of the majority now and not the minority.,3
Snyder said on Vero that Steppenwolf was gonna look like this before WB told him to change it. He even talked about this on his BvS screening he did last year I guess.,2
"“Hope is like your car keys.....”   I don’t care what version of Superman you prefer, that line is fucking awful lmfao",3
"> It could cause confusion among the GA, if you have two versions of JL that are quite different, people might get confused, especially when some people are already confused about what's happening with films like The Batman, etc.  I think the talk is that it is likely only going to be finding itself on HBO max.    As they need exclusive content to sell the service especially at the price it's at.  So I don't think it would end up with too much confusion, unless it does great there and there is a limited theater run.  ANd considering the billions spent on Big Bang theory and friends, I think the 10-20 million needed to finish the film wouldn't be anything they'd question.  The number of 30-50 million has always been not only the VFX but likely legal fees and paying the hundreds of actors for screen time or roles, where their credited role was changed so they earned less or they weren't in the film at all, so they don't get residuals.  Just paid for their time on set.",1
"There have been multiple female Doctor Fates and Hawkman has reincarnated multiple times and the original Earth version was from Ancient Egypt, so if you're trying to make some point about PC Hollywood, you've picked a bad example.",3
Lol. Geoff Johns has lived and breathed DC for years bringing us amazing comicbooks that have resurrected characters like Green Lantern and The Flash. He’s an amazing writer and still works for DC for some reason. I don’t fcking care if Nelson doesn’t like him for some reason. Geoff is one of the most important people that have ever worked for DC Comics.,1
"WB tried to silence the movement today with an article through Variety saying the Snyder Cut is a ""pipe dream"". Zack responded in kind.",3
In alternate universe Daniel day Lewis is joker.,1
"I mean, that’s possible but he could also just have an album of favorite shots from the cut that he chooses to post from, instead of actually going through the movie every single time.",2
It's offscreen but BVS mentions him shifting a plate to stop an earthquake. Plus Supes did drag that ship through solid ice in the same film  You can see it on the wall to the right in the link below  [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/c/ce/BvSFeat.png/revision/latest?cb=20170605194341](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/c/ce/BvSFeat.png/revision/latest?cb=20170605194341),1
That looks horrendous.,0
No one is saying he did. The guy is saying in 2016 they were given designs to create Hot Toys for JL 1 and JL2 for Warner Bros,1
She’s the first WW actually from that part of the world we presume Themiscyra is located ( the Med),1
Fucking Joss Wheadon,0
IMO I doubt the people editing the promos know or care who shot what. They're just putting random clips together from the movies/tv shows.,1
Henry Cavil also gave his MI6 character the mustache himself.,2
You make a good point about Ava's movie. Releasing the cut and then demanding more movies would completely overshadow the current slate and this is a slate WB is proud of at the moment. Everything is going as planned for them for once and they cannot fuck this up for a cut.,0
Yeah it's a full article:   [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-21/robert-pattinson-lighthouse-batman-oscars](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-21/robert-pattinson-lighthouse-batman-oscars),2
"Again, you nailed what you wanted to deliver",2
I'm just curious is Joss to this sub what D&D is to the freefolk?,2
"No. General audiences aren't high on Batfleck. I know most people here loved him, but it's the truth. The box office performance of his two movies should be an indicator. There was a poll done (an actual scientific poll) conducted by THR and Morning Consultant, where his Batman came in last place among all portrayals. This is bad, considering that he is the most recent Batman and recency bias alone should have saw him finish higher. [Here is a link, it's a good read.](https://morningconsult.com/2019/06/18/as-pattinson-answers-bat-signal-bale-and-keaton-top-fan-favorites/)  > Among the different Caped Crusaders, Christian Bale of the “Dark Knight” trilogy and Michael Keaton of “Batman” and “Batman Returns” were the most favored Batman actors with a net favorability of 60 points and 59 points, respectively. **Ben Affleck’s portrayal of Batman in 2016’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and 2017’s “Justice League” had the lowest net favorability at 18 points**.",2
WB doesn’t work like that and they probably never will. They haven’t even acknowledged this movie yet. Don’t run into conclusions. First step is for them to acknowledge it and then you can hope that you may see it someday(me too).,1
What's the second image overlaying on top?,2
Luthor needs to be recasted to keep Superman in universe.,0
"Yes, most media has some form of representation for most demographics, but it's not a case of ""we did it in this one TV show, that should be enough"", being represented means consistent across media.   And this isn't a case of people saying ""If Superman isn't X, I can't relate to him"", it's people wanting to feel represented though different charcaters. I doubt many people are actively campaigning for Superman to be black, but if so, why is that such an issue. Don't get me wrong, I love comic accuracy, but it's not the end of the world.  But If you don't like traits being added to a charcater, are you happy that Superman can fly, or that batman is a father?",1
Problem is if BoP is a hit then they are definitely going to do another film since Margot is full on committed to the character and tbh the only avenue that would make sense after this solo Harley film is a Joker mashup and Leto is the only guy who could do that.,1
He could do Ralph and Sue Dibney as detectives!,1
Keanu for Doctor Fate. Fassbender as Mister Freeze. Hugo for Braniac. All great actors that can play any role btw,3
"I don’t know, man. You’re bringing up terms like dated when one of the leads is literally just wearing colorful Greco-era war armor, and generic when talking in favor of a monster looking like the previous movie’s monster except with spiky armor and a pointy helmet and a color scheme that can be summed up as “gray.”   Agree to disagree, then.",1
100% agree. This was an origin story and that’s it. I’m scared a sequel of it will tarnish the whole point of the first movie. I’m down for Phillips doing an origin for other villains. All standalones.,3
The great question is who would pay Darkseid! My pick is Denzel Washington!! I think it’s top notch casting and a name worth of DARKSEID.  Btw this guy is a great casting choice for Metron!,0
I remember watching this when i saw Bvs in the theater and was like i been on that street in Detroit Michigan and its near my favorite Comic book store Vault of Midnight,1

"You are hilarious. Having a plan won’t stop a movie from sucking, sometimes your plan just sucks. The DCEU is proof of that.",1
"Definitely, good directors can have good and bad ideas, just like bad directors can have good and bad ideas. It's healthy to be able to recognize that, and I'm glad we can agree on this one. I don't like Snyder, but I still appreciate some things he brought to the table. The first flight scene from Man of Steel is great, for example. And he had a good eye for casting Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa, which someone else may very well have overlooked.",2
Smile when life hits you really hard...,2
My pants just got tight,2
"Not everyone hates BvS. All the complaints people throw at it over the storytelling, or the tone, or the characterization, some of us absolutely love it for those reasons and see those flaws in other superhero films instead. If you didn't like the Snyder films, you probably won't like the Snyder Cut. If you did like his films, it's reasonable to think you'll like his cut of JL better than the studio version.",1
Seals in the flavor.,1
I don't believe so. I'd never seen that either.,2
Just show him Joker directly.,1
I love at the 2 hour 10 min mark we were supposed to get a scene with darkseid.,1
"I heard Kevin Tsujihara wanted to get revenue to a certain level to meet a bonus threshold. Without JL, he wouldn't have hit that, so instead of delay, he and the others rushed it thru and made it sub 2 hours to make more showings per day.   I can't evidence much of it, but if anything smacks of ""2 hour mandate"", it's a movie with deleted material that just happens to come in at 1h59.",2
"Oh man I would totally love a full on comics arc with Snyder & Terrio's original vision. Starting with Man of Steel. I also wouldnt mind a look, at the original Justice League script/story that was too hardcore for WB.",1

This is probably why he didn’t say anything during the week. So he doesn’t ruffle any feathers that he needs on his side. But isn’t it a coincidence that this article comes out right after the Snyder cut weekend? 😊,1

Apart from villains I'd like to see lesser known characters like The Question, Booster Gold, Red Hood and the Outlaws, Blue Devil, Wild Dog, Hawk and Dove, Azrael, Martian Manhunter, Etrigan etc. Also I think Vertigo movies like Hellblazer, Phantom Stranger, Swamp Thing, etc. would be great.  I'd also like these movies to be R Rated.",1
actually everybody agree that first avengers movie is not whedon style at all. only in age of ultron he has control of the movie but marvel studios cut his scenes,0
They are xebelians,2
I love how the film and the series both make great use of their respective mediums to deliver on the graphic novel's legacy. *Watchmen* the film contains some of my all-time favorite sequences of any CBM (adapted or otherwise) while *Watchmen* the series has been showing everyone the fertile ground that lies between our reality and the alternate history that Alan Moore conceived so many years ago.,3
Agreed. Although you can bet your arse I will be first in line to a Lex Luthor film.   Lucifer is my top choice for a DC Black film.,1
Smash that unsub button fam,3
Lol I just wanted to say this comment is awesome.,1
Budget vs Box-Office?,1
What do you not get?. Batman/Bruce had no idea that lex knew his identity...  Lex is slyly letting him know that he's aware of who he truly is.,1
"I've always believed this is what they are doing. After Justice League, WB pumped the brakes on any grand plans the DCEU had and are focusing on standalone stories while they sort through and put everything back together. While I think the DCEU will remain director driven with pocket universes (Atlantean, Shazam, Gotham, etc.) going forward, I think if the hits keep coming WB will start getting comfortable with crossovers again and eventually do another Justice League movie. This time it will be more successful because it will be separated from the divisiveness of the early DCEU era and people will have come to know and love the characters better.  As far as Batman goes, Affleck departed the role and Matt Reeves has full creative control. I think it is a hard reboot of Batman within the DCEU. Reeves wanted a younger Batman and was given the power to recast Alfred and Gordon to better fit his vision. I'm sure that characters like Harley and Deadshot are off limits for recasting. With Gotham City Sirens likely getting greenlit if Birds of Prey is successful, WB would be stupid not to have Zoe Kravitz reprise her role as Catwoman when she will be seen as such after appearing in The Batman. It's logical for Reeves' movie to remain in the DCEU.",2

8* year olds dude.  Edit. Thanks r/Elysium94,2
"I don't understand the sentiment that a bad sequel would tarnish the legacy of the first movie! A lot of classic movies had terrible sequels, but they're still considered classics.  Joker introduced a lot of problems in our society but it didn't offer any solutions, that could be an interesting topic for sequel. Or they could make an Arkham asylum movie inspired by 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest' (credit to random redditor).",1
Lol where’s Arkham Knight,1
"And he still tags almost everything with #borglife. Warner couldn't ask for a more enthusiastic actor and ambassador for the franchise, and they're just...doing nothing with him.",3
That Martha Line works if the Batman in question has been pretending it’s all fine and the line makes him realize he’s become the monster he’s supposed to be stopping. Which is the case here,3

"I truly believe it was purposeful. But for more complex, political reasons. I think it plays into the AT&T-Warner merger. WB had to curry favor to the FCC because Trump, Under the influence of Murdoch (FOX), was fighting to stop it from happening. Using the power of his administration to do so. Disney also needed to fight the merger and also protect their Marvel franchise, while also doing a favor for FOX. In some way it all comes together. The idiots at WB didn’t realize or didn’t care that the idiots at Disney had the left ear of the idiots at FOX, who had the left ear of the idiots at the White House. Shrine, Murdoch and others saw an opportunity to win in several ways. The #Metoo movement was gutting the hierarchy of FOX and it was beneficial to smear others to distort the message and distract from the big players. I truly think Ben was targeted to achieve this. Meanwhile Disney is threatened by the JL movie for its obvious parallel in the story for the grand finale of their decade long Marvel campaign. If JL had realized Snyder’s vision, it would have surely dented the final numbers and acclaim received by Infinity War/Endgame-audiences would have no doubt been underwhelmed by the obvious repeat of so many plot points they would have already seen in JL. People need to realize how ruthless Disney is in competition and that just because they tweet nice things (which I regard as mocking) doesn’t mean they give two shits about WB’s BO achievements. Corporate sabotage is a real thing and fans have been played hard, especially in this very sub. In some way I can’t wholly piece together WB managed to allow Disney and Whedon to royally fuck up their movie, so they could gain favor for their AT&T merger, while simultaneously hurting the BO numbers, permanently damaging the DCCEU, and also destroying the reputation of an actor in one of the most coveted roles in Hollywood. In the end the AT&T merger happened-but so did the Disney/FOX merger, which was completely fucked and should not have happened. FOX assets should have been broken up. The biggest winner of all was Murdoch and co, who pocketed untold sums of cash that would guarantee his assets survive beyond the Trump presidency and the fall of FOX News, which is inevitable as the older generations die off.  [Check out this article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house)  Most notably these parts:  > Telecommunications is a highly regulated industry, and **under Trump the government has consistently furthered Murdoch’s business interests, to the detriment of his rivals.** Hundt, the former F.C.C. chairman, told me that “there have been three moves that have taken place in the regulatory and antitrust world” involving telecommunications “that are **extremely unusual, and the only way to explain them is that they’re pro-Fox, pro-Fox, and pro-Fox.”**  > Last June, after only **six months** of deliberation, **the Trump Administration approved Fox’s bid to sell most of its entertainment assets to Disney, for seventy-one billion dollars.** The Murdoch family will receive more than **two billion dollars in the deal, and will become a major stockholder in the combined company.** The Justice Department expressed no serious antitrust concerns, even though the combined company will reportedly **account for half the box-office revenue in America.** Trump publicly congratulated Murdoch even before the Justice Department signed off on the deal, and claimed that it would create jobs. In fact, the consolidation is projected to result in thousands of layoffs.  > **The Justice Department, meanwhile, went to court in an effort to stop A. T. & T.’s acquisition of Time Warner, which owns CNN.** Time Warner saw the deal as **essential to its survival** at a time when the media business is increasingly dominated by giant competitors such as Google and Facebook. Murdoch understood this impulse: **in 2014, 21st Century Fox had tried, unsuccessfully, to buy Time Warner.** For him, opposing his rivals’ deal was a matter of shrewd business. Trump also opposed the deal, but many people suspected that his objection was a matter of petty retaliation against CNN. Although Presidents have traditionally avoided expressing opinions about legal matters pending before the judicial branch, Trump has bluntly criticized the plan. The day after the Justice Department filed suit to stop it, he declared the proposed merger “not good for the country.”   > Trump Administration officials say that political considerations did not guide the government’s actions on the three deals. Blair Levin, the former F.C.C. official, told me, “There may be innocent explanations.” But, he adds, “**Trump famously said you’re going to get sick and tired of winning, and that may not be true for the rest of America, but it sure is true of Murdoch.”** He says of Murdoch, “He’s an incredibly cunning political player. **He leaves no fingerprints**. He’s been in the game of influencing government behavior to his benefit longer than most of us have been alive.”   These movies may seem like harmless comic book adaptations that are a fun way to spend a few hours, but besides that they are *big* business. The difference between a successful and failed big budget film is the difference between the continuing success and profit of a movie studio and all those roped into it. Murdoch and co are truly gifted in their insight to how media influences  the average american. They are the puppet masters and the know exactly how to create a perfect storm to upend their rivals. The bottom line is, something dirty went down between WB, Disney, FOX and the Fed. And the DC community and the artists dedicated to it lost big time.",3

It’s like changing a backstory.  I really do get it, I think fans should be able to push back like they do with every other detail without fear of being called racists as well.   For me, I’m really just hoping for a great set of storytelling, I think Cavill is the man for the job, but it sounds troubling atm.",0

"Until someone from WB officially spells the future of the franchise out, this going to be a bit like an ink blot with people projecting their hopes, wants, and wishes, I think. (Typically stating it as fact of course.)   Information published in trade journals is considered reliable, and that is how the studio releases info. Regarding Reeves' Batman film Deadline has reported ""This film will in no way carry on the work that Ben Affleck did in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."" The film has cast a different Alfred and Commissioner Gordon than Ben Affleck's Batman had. Reeves' Batman is not a younger version of Zack Snyder's. It is an entirely different Batman.  It appears that Reeves' Batman film will stand alone from the shared universe or continuity established by MoS, BvS, SS, WW, JL, Aquaman, and Shazam that we call the ""DCEU."" It is presumed that Reeves will make a Batman trilogy. But I'm actually not sure if any industry trade has reported that Reeves has indeed signed for a trilogy (if anyone has a link for same please post) versus rather just to make this one film and then if it succeeds presumably a trilogy is likely to proceed. In the latter scenario the movie can, if needed, be a one-off standalone like Joker, which does provide some flexibility. And for that matter a Reeves Batman trilogy can also stand alone, and never connect with anything else.   However it is also certainly possible that Pattinson's Batman could simply be inserted into the existing continuity, and characters and viewers would pretend that the Ben Affleck version simply never existed. This however would in effect erase MoS, BvS, and JL from the continuity's history. Some fans, especially the ones that dislike Snyder's approach (or if ambivalent about it nevertheless feel that overall it failed), would probably like that! Or at least they wouldn't care about that rupture of continuity. But to erase MoS, BvS, and JL from the history of that world would clearly risk alienating Snyder fans.   One thing that I think can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that given that we clearly have an established rogues gallery for a Batman relatively early in his career, Reeves Batman universe seems to somewhat be based on a DC Animated Universe style approach for the world in which Batman exists. This could be tonally quite different from the more grounded current DCEU, although it can be fairly argued that the entire DCEU could begin moving in that same direction as well.   Henry Cavill's future as Superman has been rumored to be over, or unclear, as the studio has not undertaken significant development of his character since JL--and as we all know the theater release of JL bombed. Zack Snyder had completed principal photography for JL but he stepped away because his daughter suicided after completing about 6 months of post production. The theater release of JL was heavily rewritten and reshot at the studio's insistence by Joss Whedon. As most fans that follow the DCEU are aware, Jason Momoa and Zack Snyder have both stated that Snyder's cut of the film is essentially finished.  WB has officially stated that for the time being it will simply focus on having each superhero character (or group, such as Suicide Squad) occupy its own world without having to connect to each other. But this doesn't mean that at some point they won't reconnect and interact again.   There is a recent development within the fandom that any sensible observer must factor in. The week before last the Release The Snyder Cut (RTSC) fan movement had a phenomenally successful event of regularly tweeting the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut hashtag, culminating with a day long event last Sunday. Screenrant reports that Sunday's event produced 900K tweets, reaching easily over 8 billion sets of eyeballs. The outpouring of fan support was evidently so successful that some industry insiders (principally Grace Randolph) have been reporting that negotiations are currently underway for release of the Snyder cut of JL, whether solely on HBO Max alone or combined with a theater release as well.   How the presumed release of the Snyder cut will factor into the DC Films franchise is completely unknown. One possibility that some have suggested is that Snyder's DCEU could continue as part of WB's new Black Label brand of standalone films that Joker launched. If the Snyder cut does get released and it is popular and successful, perhaps there could even be a continuation of Snyder's originally planned five film arc. And if this comes to pass, then Reeves' Batman would pretty clearly form the foundation for a new separate continuity.   Take with a grain of salt obviously, but Grace Randolph reports that Henry Cavill sided with Joss Whedon about the studio mandated rewrite/reshoots for JL, whereas the rest of the cast was against it. Apparently Henry has always wanted to play a more traditional Superman. If the Snyderverse continues (again, perhaps via Black Label), will Henry even agree to participate?   Another big factor that is as yet a wild card, is J.J. Abrams having made a deal with WB to provide content for HBO Max and presumably DC Films as well. It is presumed that Abrams will make a Superman film. (He wanted to make one in 2003.) If so, will Abrams want to use Henry Cavill? Recast the role? Create his own standalone Superman? Have his Superman be part of the existing continuity? We don't know.",2

"Maybe around the holidays as a kind of Christmas present they will announce the Snyder cut but with a special package for HBO Max to incentivize early subscription for around something like 3 months, or 6 months that offers a special edition disk set of director's cuts of MoS, BvS, and of course JL.   I realize Snyder has said that he feels good about MoS in its current form. But he has also said that there are longer versions of some scenes. Is there any doubt but that fans would want to see that? So maybe call it an extended edition, whatever. And while I have read some say that Snyder has commented on Vero, and/or stated at the so-called Snyder-con last March, that he considers BvS UE his ""director's cut"" of that movie, it is not so-named and no one has ever provided a link to substantiate it (to me anyway). And there is another hour of footage that he shot in the assembly cut. I know I would love to see a 3:15-30-ish cut of BvS. Including the scene Snyder has mention mentioned of Superman using his super hearing to search for Martha that the studio felt was too disturbing, etc.   The wild card, though, is whether a 3:34 movie such as this gets a theater release. First, that runtime reduces the number of IMAX showings. Second, imo honestly this is advisable if and only if this version of the film really does kick ass. There's a tremendous amount of hype built up now, and the movie has some very high expectations to meet. If it's going to be regarded as a mediocre film or worse by the mainstream then personally I would prefer to see it offered only via streaming and disk.  As we all know, on IMDb the April 3, 2020 slot that was once listed for Cyborg is now displayed as ""unknown DC Film"" with its status is described as ""completed."" If WB goes full open throttle with this and the Snyder cut gets a theater release, it would roughly correspond to launch of HBO Max. The pitch for HBO Max subscribers would be that you'll get this on streaming after the theater run, and exclusively at HBO Max, etc.",2

He has enough time to like BossLogic's post on instagram ([https://www.instagram.com/p/B5MO59xgMsC/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5MO59xgMsC/)), but doesn't make the time to post the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut hashtag. He comes across as aloof and not a team player like the rest of the cast.",1
"I think he knows Joaquin is already the Joker, obviously. He’s saying that Joaquin should join in on the Battinson train.",1
"We'll that's literally how he ended up with joker. He pitched an entire label, but ended up getting a movie.  https://lrmonline.com/news/joker-todd-phillips-pitched-the-dc-black-label-to-wb-and-they-told-him-to-calm-down/",3
They are basically going to ignore everything Snyder did with Batman and if they make a crossover they will just use Pattinson. So its a full on reboot for Batman and they won't explain it,2
"They at least worked throughout March. He announces stepping down May 22. He was working on Aquaman effects on March 1. The tragedy is listed as March 12 and Zack said he tried going back to work for sometime after. Paired with Jay Oliva saying that they worked on VFX throughout production, among other comments and pictures, I'd wager that upwards of 80% of vfx are done. I made up that number, but it's got to be better than not. Zack saying that he didn't get Swanwick turning into Martian Manhunter leads me to believe it is small things that are unfinished, rather than big things like the history lesson.",3
It's probably the same reason why Warners also removed Darkseid/Uxas from Snyder's JL. I'm guessing Warners don't wanna give anymore DC characters to Snyder. Vulko was shown in Aquaman first and the credit is most likely going to go to James Wan even tho we already know that Dafoe was cast as Vulko in JL first. It's all part of Warners moving away from Snyder's vision.  This is like more reason why Warners won't release the Snyder Cut. JL is just like one big damage control and course correction by Warners.,3
Im just talking about comics and comic book movies....I didnt mention any other media,1
I mean people said this before too,1
"That could be an interesting take, focus more on his telepathy and intangability -- more of a spy than a fighter.",1
"the S is pretty cool, probably the one thing about the 2013-2017 suits that I actually consistently liked.   Oh the boots were killer too",3
"Exactly without Cap, Iron Man Hulk and Thor they really don’t have anything worthwhile on the horizon till they reboot FF and X-men",0
"And you people who constantly feel the need to cover for him are delusional. It's common knowledge he was the one who was forcing the reshoots of suicide squad, which resulted in that mish mash story and tone.   Giving a comic book writer full creativity of a M O V I E is completely different story writing. Johns doesn't have any knowledge or the science of movie writing.",1
Emilia for Hawkgirl or Mera (She's even been Jason's love interest and they seem like good friends),2
You'll always have a special place in my heart.,1
"Alright! Then ill just tell him who joker is, what he represents, and show him the movie! Thanks man",1
Racism isn't an *opinion* that gets a seat at the table.,1
This is honestly the most beatiful and hopeful thing i have read in a long time.,1
I think Harley works best as a supporting character. We'll see how this movie goes but I would have much preferred that Harley would have been lined up alongside the OG badass Black Canary and Huntress with Barbara Gordon calling the shots.   You can have them recruit Harley because she knows a lot about the guy they are chasing down. Because the Joker dealt with him frequently.,3
Phoenix is doing a sequel? That's incredibly surprising.,3
"You don't feel that you could look at any movie prior to release and it couldn't ""go either way?""  You have never seen a movie that looks amazing but turns out to be less than that? You have never ended up seeing a movie that didn't look great but were blown away by??  No, I think its VERY accurate. Any movie could go either way, in theory.  Its a more rare case to see a movie that's as amazing as the trailers, or better than.",0
Anyone got the picture in high-res?,1
Thats never going to happen,3
"I mean, it’s the movie he directed and he’s the one that personally released it. If that’s not good enough for you then that’s your issue. The dude released it himself, he’s the source.",3
She is perfect as Mera.,0
Brilliant work. I’d love it to be titled Man of Tomorrow too. Loosely adapt that comic of the same name maybe? But with Brainiac as the villain instead of Zod.  Great potential there.,1
"It’s more so showing how Superman led to his life being even worse. But what it also does is make Wally a certain kind of bitter. Because losing your wife is one thing, losing your wife because you lost your legs? That hits your pride, that hits your belief in love. And that can add to Wally being the one behind the bombing according to the media and the police, so that Lex can cover his tracks even more.",0
Hell yeah! He's good Police.,1
Yeah the TDK chase scene is a classic to me was mentioning the dock chase from BVS.,1
No more Black race bending please. The Batman is already starting the look like Black Panther.,0
And what boosted Aquaman? Justice League? 😩,0
Joel Schumacher approves.,1
"Pretty common knowledge. But definitely see the Ultimate Edition, it's beautiful.",1
"Yeah, it's just I miss opening credits sequences. Especially because that's a Superman tradition. It could've been a modern update on the old school credits. New font, new score (""Flight""), but similar old style. Paying homage while also updating for the modern age, essentially what MoS as a movie did to the Donner duology.",1
Had to man . Integrity over bs.,2
"While I don’t disagree with you, any reason as to why that would be the case?",0
"Love MOS and BVS DOJ UE, but i dont think henry is intrested in this beyond the pay, he backs up the popular opinion and i felt he wants that Geoff Vibe , lets see who lands MOS 2 or Superman movie going frw and if they are down with HC",0
They’re both shitty things to do.,2
"I honestly think a vigilante Batman would not be wearing body molded rubber armor, and loose-ish fabric would suit him much better. The suit looks really good [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/vbW7we7XCHtAMJ8V6)  [here ](https://images.app.goo.gl/ZnfvAxvbipZLLsf4A) and [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/MqJ1cz6tY6kxak23A)",2
"Outstanding choices.  My top choice would be Cillian Murphy, but these picks here are great!",1
"Really my main MoS criticism is the hack-y dialogue throughout and some non-sensical plot points. Could've been a great overall, but for me that stuff really holds it back. BvS has way better dialogue imo",1
They’ll release it with hbomax trust,3
"I knew i'm not the only one who thought the performances in reshot scenes felt completely bland. Perhaps except for Cavill who apparently enjoyed this version of Superman more (good for him!) and maybe Ezra who was a newcomer anyway. Yeah, i don't blame them. I'm sure they all thought they are creating something special with Zack.",3
He’s so ridiculous.,0
These guys seriously need to move on from those movies. They are over 40 years old at this point,0
"Damn, so much for the Madhater origin story.",1
Idris Elba is not going to be Deadshot...,3
"I'd like to see him fully-formed as THE Joker, working as a high-level hitman for one of the warring mobs. Spoken of only in rumors - until we see him in the end. He gets a great scene and meets Batman for the first time, but is carted away - with the implication that he's just found a new purpose. He's basically just a bizarre side character at the beginning of his journey.   Then he doesn't return until part three, in which he's the main antagonist.",1
They definitely have something planned,2
That is the best 'S' design in all of Superman media IMO,1
"Given the impact Joker has had, it'll age just fine.",1
there's a lot of projecting going on here lol she was in all of 5 secs of a 2m trailer for a 2hr movie,0
"> This isn't some conspiracy, and it's certainly not racist, if Jordan was meeting with WB about Superman, it was more than likely about Calvin Ellis or Val-Zod  I would love to see your reaction when he is cast as Clark Kent Superman. No way WB greenlight some alternate multiverse superman when they can't get the main one right",1
Are you referring to Marvel's Civil War as trash in comparison to BvS? Civil War is a personal favorite but bias aside that movie at least was more coherent than BvS. That was a mess of a film that tried to do way too much.,2
"Wait, what?? Where did you hear that?",1
"Yeah, good luck on that one. Going stronger and stronger for two years and you seriously expect it to pop like a bubble day to day?",2
"Wtf is ""The American Way"" mate? Saying shit like that with all seriousness in 2019 just sounds corny as fuck. Even Captain AMERICA doesn't talk like that in the marvel movies.   >And if you want an angry, self loathing, sad, violent Superman   Yes because me saying I dont want to see corny, roll my eyes to the back of my head shit in superhero movies in this day and age when they are of such high quality equals to me saying all of that. The recent Superman movies, The Death of Superman and Reign of the Supermen dont have any of that corny 1970's crap in them and they were sick as fuck in my opinion. The marvel movies aren't corny but they are still funny and lighthearted enough.    Making superman a cornball is just not it for me, I'm sorry. Captain America is a similar character to superman in a lot of ways and hes a straight fucking badass in most of the marvel movies, theres no excuse.",1
Issacs: Your Justice League were miserable fools!  Bridges: Steppenwolf created these Boom tubes in a city! With a box of mothers!  Washington: Superman ain't got no sh\*t on me!  I'm using these characters 'catchphrases to imagine what Darkseid would say if played by these actors.,1
"There was another comment thread where we were talking abt potential voices: Pedro Pascal, Javier Bardem.   I think The Batman will not use Grundy, but I agree it’d be really cool to see him do Grundy",2
 Who ordered this?,0
The first and last time we will ever see this guy on the big screen....lol,1
I feel like Luke Evans was born for this role,2
"No I didn’t. John C. Reilly is a great character actor, doesn’t mean he would make a good Falcone.",0
"You could argue the fact that they even took a pitch as left field as Michael B Jordan playing an alternate version of Superman (presumably), that it shows how little faith they have in the HC version of the character. Why take the meeting at all if they always intended to stick with Henry?",2
"I always thought that Hemsworth didn’t look huge in his appearances as Thor. I mean, he’s not small by any means, but he never looked like a huge dude to me.",2
In this world I believe anything can happen however when telling a single narrative it needs to be limited otherwise we could have all sorts of clashing tones in one scene and the audience would be jarred.  Zack established the DCEU's tone. Some small deviances from this aren't the end of the world as long as it stays within that tonal range. SS was in that tonal range. WW towed the line but Aquaman was completely it's own thing. Instead of LOTR style Atlantis which fits  the aesthetic and tone of the universe we get science fantasy like cartoon like space suits. The unique quality that the universe had. Something no one else could mimic and what had worked so well for DC was abandoned for a universe without cohesion or internal logic. All the detail was thrown away and the films feel weightless as a result.,0
Renee montoya,2
They’ve been wanting Tom Cruise for years for this role.,3
Oof yes! Solid casting,2
"Should be JJ Abrams imo. A franchise revival that audiences will love is NEEDED for Superman to continue to regularly be in films from now on, everyone needs to understand that.  And before anyone brings up the sole reason to not have him as ""DiD yOu ReAd tHe FlYbY sCrIpT?"", they're obviously going to use another script and probably get someone talented like Christina Hodson to write it for them.",3
RED SON,1
"What I'm saying is the ""insiders"" shouldn't demand to be anonymous when they're trying to make claims every known fact is against. Unless, again, their life or safety is in danger.",0
The best route to take is a Ryan Reynolds approach.,2
"Until WB crawls out of the woodwork and stop being cowards and say ""It's not coming"", the Snyder Cut campaign is still gonna keep going.  These articles keep using phrases like ""Anonymous sources tell us"" or ""Knowledgeable insiders say"" and these are just non statements. These same anonymous sources and insiders said last year that there was definitively no Snyder Cut and look at what we know now.   They also ignore that literally everyone involved with the Snyder Cut wants it.   Tbh, I've no idea why WB are hiding it. The Snyder Cut is so anticipated now and will make a lot of money if they release it. I'd even make an argument that the Snyder Cut is just as (if not more) anticipated than WW84",3
Hawkman is supposedly the main supporting character,3
"First of all, this isn't a poster. Second of all, they aren't wearing casual clothes. And you say, it doesn't take much to get sold on a comic book movie but this tiny thing makes it look like a big piece of shit to you?",1
You're not wrong,1
Didn't mean it like that man. It's just my anger speaking. I meant like they should've fired him and told him to fuck off,0
“in the movie”. These words are intentional in my opinion. Interesting timing with the Variety article out there today 🤔,3
Oh I see now  Granted we'll be seeing him in New Gods so that's fun,1
Zack did a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong (like killing off Jimmy Olsen for one....) but I just interpreted it as Mera water bended the water to stop Arthur from leaving so they could talk. Although that was in the JL TC and seemingly here Vulko also has this ability so I'm gonna have to say that's another knock on Snyder. IF it was legit used to stop Arthur from leaving its genius but if Zack intended for the water bubbles to always be their form of talking then yeah I'm gonna chalk that one up as another bad idea personally,1
Because they are THR or Variety or because they are trusted writers in front of the articles?  And did Variety or THR actually in fact say anything?  NO  All that was said by either was that when asking an unnamed insider the answer of it's release was it wasn't happening.  Or that there was no immanent announcement incoming?  What the fuck is that worth?,2
"I thought the original rumor was origin stories of the *other* Rogues' Gallery characters. Penguin, Riddler, etc. I'd love to see how they'd pull off Clayface, or Killer Croc. I think the backstory I want - nay, *need* - the most is Condiment King.",1
"For starters, you're making the assumption that Jordan would be playing Clark Kent. There is nothing that suggested he would be playing Kent. As I'm sure others will point out, Calvin Ellis (Earth 23),and Val-Zod are both existing characters. A Michael B. Jordan Superman film could easily be based on one (or a mix of both) characters. Also, Aquaman was cast as the half-Pacific Islander Jason Momoa, so if that isn't a problem, I'm not sure why this would be.   Personally I think there's more to explore with the regular Kal El Superman,and I hope the next Superman movie is about him. I haven't even read anything featuring Calvin Ellis or Val-Zod. So I have no interest in those characters (but nothing against them either). But the anger from comics fans about certain ""race swaps"" seems to be completely arbitrary and inconsistent in nature.",2
He will do a great riddler.,1
death by snu snu,1
Waste? Mr. Terrific is vital part od dcu,0
YOU ARE NOT ALONE,3
For the MCU she may be. She’s the Eternal that will most likely be on the next Avengers team.,2
"Poison Ivy isn't in BoP from what we know. Hopefully in Gotham City Sirens whenever that happens. Given DC uses any excuse it can to have a lesbian couple (Arrowverse. There's more lesbian couplings than any other), it seems like the move they'd make, and I'd like to see it happen. To me they make more sense for a damaged-but-affectionate couple than what they tried with Leto in SS.",2
Wow so amazing.,2
"> The success of the MCU started with the main avengers   Who, with the possible exception of the Hulk, most people didn't know that much or care about prior to the MCU.  >story people were kinda forced to watch Guardians and ms Marvel and Strange  LOL no they weren't.   >Black Widow will underperform at the box office just wait and see. So I stand my ground on what I said  We'll see next year, won't we?",1
"He has to because he owe it too the fans, Galot and Aflex already done their part.",0
She's an abuser.,3
I don't care if it costs 200 bucks. Just release that shit already GODDAMMIT,0
Henry has too much negative baggage as Superman. Why would WB invest more money into Cavill as Superman when every movie he’s appeared in as Superman is critically panned and underwhelming at the box office?   I’m all for JJ rebooting Superman into his buddy Matt Reeves’ Batman universe but with a new actor. A total reboot.,0
You're completely entitled to think so.,2
Snyder said on Vero that Steppenwolf was gonna look like this before it was changed.,0
I think initially he was all on board during Man Of Steel. I think BvS is where the twos individuals visions of the character diverged. Its why he isnt in staunch support but also dislikes the theatrical JL cut as well,3
Joss Whedon https://twitter.com/joss/status/923795350174887936?s=20,0
"True, as I said I really do think JL was a step in the right direction for Superman...and kinda only Superman tbh. I do hope we get the hair curl soon. There is something I would do to build up to him getting his more traditional look but I'll save that for another post.",0
"The mods in some subreddits like /r/movies censor stories that spread news about the Snyder cut, so a lot of people are still ignorant in movie subreddits. Also, /r/DCcomics is known to ban people discussing ZS and /r/comicbookmovies mostly has Marvel movie discussions. I still hear people say ""Zack doesn't understand Watchmen"". Like bruh, he gave us the closest and most faithful adaptation we were ever gonna get, and yet people still repeat the same opinions that influencers told them are the cool and trendy default opinions to have. Even sarcastic stuff like ""Too bad they never made a sequel to the Matrix"" and disregarding any good parts.",2
"Wait....those three goons behind WW, they're from For honor",1
Every week there's this _exact_ post. Not very inspired casting.,1
Middle Eastern technically,1
Oh absolutely. I’m loving it,2
They're so pretty 😭😭😭,3
"Lol seriously. The arbitrary bits of realism make no sense if you take the universe as a whole. It’s like what Grant Morrison said. Paraphrasing here obviously, but “It doesn’t matter. These people aren’t real. Kids can tell the difference between fantasy and reality, but adults can’t.”",3
"I know the CW shows haven't had the most consistency among them however this season i've pretty much enjoyed everything they've been doing among Supergirl , Arrow , The Flash , Black Lightning and Batwoman it's probably their strongest start to any season.  This gives me high expectations for the Crisis event especially with the caliber of people they've got for guest appearances. Just seeing Kevin Conroy in that image gives me chills i'm gonna cry tears of joy when i see him in action.",1
DUDES! hes definitely an underrated actor. Unexpectedly great choice imo.,3
"Not that you'd wrong, but this is probably why people don't care",3
This is hardcore!!,2
Well not just one source like everyone else likes to do. ;),0
Also notice how the coffee cup from GOT made it onto this table somehow.,3
Wow so the Birds of Prey actually ARE in the Birds of Prey movie! This is the first time I've seen them!,1
"Than anything Joss has done? I’m no fan of what he did to Justice League, but insulting Firefly is not ok.",1
So was he supposed to be Darkseid for all of the movies or just a place holder until they got a bigger actor for a later movie.,1
Spot on!,1
"Another reason I can’t stand Snyder’s Superman is that Whedon knows how to use his powers. A Superman who can hold off several high powered heroes and still have the resources to kick into superspeed and lock eyes with Flash (all while still not fully powered up himself after being in a Kryptonian coma for close to a year, and then later single-handedly knock back an Apokoliptan) is *never* going to have a problem fighting multiple other Kryptonians with only ten minutes’ worth of experience with yellow sun radiation compared to his lifetime on Earth.",1
"100% agree.  Compared to the more quippy, sarcastic humor of the MCU, Aquaman really brings me back moreso to the humor in the Raimi Spiderman films. It's silly, but it plays the sillyness straight. It isn't a ""haha, look at how dumb we are lolz"" quip. It's more organic. Less ""can a Skrull do that?"", more ""That is a bad outfit!"". Aquaman IMO is one of those films that shows how a big dumb action movie can absolutely relish in what it is rather than try to be self-referential. That worked fine for something like GotG1 or even Thor Ragnorak, but it's been getting used in EVERY MCU movie lately. And it comes across as kinda lazy. To make a game analogy, it's the problem people have with modern Sonic stories. They lack sincerity.  Like you said, Aquaman is SINCERE. And sincere comedy is something sorely lacking in modern CBMs. We get plenty of dark sincere movies, and plenty of light ironic ones, but rarely do we get a light sincere one. Again, it's closer to Raimi Spiderman or Donner Superman than it is Lester or Whedon or Gunn. Are there a few cringe moments? Yeah, but everytime I watch Aquaman I care less and less. Because it's one of those movies like MoS or WW or LotR where even on my 1000th time watching it, I'll see something I never noticed before.  I was hyping up Shazam! over Aquaman for a while, but where Shazam! has been the same level of pretty good everytime I see it, Aquaman has gone from ""eh"" to ""good"" to ""FRIGGIN AWESOME"", and I don't think that will stop. So yeah, Aquaman officially is higher than Shazam! in my rankings. Hell, it's getting dangerously close to BvSUE.  Plus, Jason is just fantastic in the role. He made Aquaman, the laughing stock of DC, into one of the best characters. That's an accomplishment.",3
He might play the original..nabu,3
"Again, BRUCE DIDNT EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT. We can assume that Lex more than likely had an employee not mention it to the boss. Wallace more than likely WAS a part of the plan even before the protest.   Him literally acknowledging the notes, as is he knew about about the checks, somehow means that he had nothing to do with them, even though said checks and newspaper clip all have similar writing on them. Come on, dude.",0
what's the series this is from?,2
"Agreed, there's a lot of potential in those CGI abs Ben had. I hope VFX Artists can do as good of a job to Pattinson.  /s",1
Kay,0
">Pattinson can do the movies where batman just began, and affleck can be the older batman.  I think by now that rumor has been killed.",2
"Dude if you actually read into the reports of those who attended the early screenings you would find that Leto is in the film, they are using multiple deleted Joker scenes that did not make it in SS for BoP.",1
The key players involved in this film have all been either replaced or demoted,1
Lol smh 👍,0
Because they didn’t release this as a press statement; it’s an article from sources.,2
I guess it would potentially confuse a general audience to release what is essentially the same film (I mean obviously there’s massive changes but this is still the first story of the league forming as they take on Steppenwolf) and would further muddy what is already an unclear direction for DC films.,1
You make it sound like it’s an ex who’s stalking.,1
"I want Nicholas Cage!  God, can you imagine how weirdly entertaining it could be?",1
Wasn’t that like a “well duh” situation? Why else would he give a crap that Bruce Wayne is meeting someone?,3
"Yeah, me too. I would prefer it if all Gotham heroes/heroines are in the same world as Batman and have some interaction in the future.",1
Don’t even try dude. These guys are borderline delusional when it comes to Snyder.,3
That too. Batfleck gave me chills. His costume was the most comic accurate yet also scary and aesthetic in any Batman movie. Hopefully Battinson's costume is like that too.,3
"I mean, it's about as much plot as Return of the King had. And that movie was friggin' awesome.",3
The main problem with Diaz is that he relied on other characters xrapping their pants in front of him being incompetent for diaz to look menacing.,1
Yeah! Let's see that Joss Whedon director's cut of Justice League!,0
"he is like "" hold my beer """,1
I’d argue that as of late there’s much more influx of Snyder related posts than anything else. Thankfully we get a new casting announcement for Batman that allows for a different topic of discussion every now and then. Also there’s much more about the future of DC that allows for discussion as opposed something from the past that were unsure will even see the light of day.,2
The editing was many things but it sure wasn’t cheap. They had three professional editors working on this flick.,0
a back up score. lol.,0
My point was that just because they didn't mention something that was already recently and widely covered by another outlet doesn't mean they're wrong that WB is not moving forward with plans to release the Snyder Cut. The person who responded to my original post seemed to be suggesting that just because they didn't talk about Black Adam that invalidates the articles comments on RTSC. It does not.,1
"The “core” of the character has never always been one thing only, it changed overtime just like the character. Frankly its pretty silly how some versions supposedly “get the core right” over another solely cuz you like em more.",2
"Huh, cool. I am looking forward to this movie, albeit cautiously optimistic.",1
"I agree. I don’t see why Mark gets so much hate. He’s incredibly detailed in his articles which results in a long read, but I rather read something like this that appears well thought out and specific.",3
"Damn, just found something to call out your ""not rEaL DC fAn"" thing from one of the people who knows DC best: https://mobile.twitter.com/jayoliva1/status/1198045218336989186",0
Chilllllll,3
"Bruhhhhhh, GTFO!!!",2
Most features are more than 100 pages. It’s roughly a page per minute of screen time.,3
"I wouldnt be surprised if Batman made 1,5 or 2 billion",0
"But even though he escaped up, it was into darkness and animalistic",1
And a small but important role in Mad Max. I’ve seen a few of her films or shows and she’s truly a great actress. Some people you can just tell they have it and a lot don’t,1
Tbh the theme of Batman and Bruce Wayne finally sharing a life was the main idea of Forever. B&R was a spiritual sequel to that. Not in the least defending B&R tho.,1
"Eh, Joker is proving to WB that they really should not focus on the universe. They tried it and it didn't do well at the box office at all, now all their solo standing films are the ones making real money.",1
"Shut the fuck up. You are being totally condescending once again.  Just because I understand and research a social issue doesnt mesnt I have to agree with the logic behind it. A criminal kills someone, I understand and research why he did it, does that mean I know have to love the murderer and support him now? No. Not at all. I just understood what drove him to that point.   And you're done because you know you are wrong and have no idea what you are talking about because you're probably q liberal science major who won't do anything with their degree and will be paying off your student loans when they are fifty, thinking the world revolves around you  You do not understand all of this.",1
"I think the one he used in the ring of fire fits the BvS one. In fact, even the orange one isn't that scifi. It's *everyone else*'s wardrobe that made it all seem sci fi.",1
I think people would be more forgiving of Whedon if he didn't start to like and retweet tweets on Twitter including the bashing of justice League and telling people to watch Thor Ragnorok instead and also tweets which were digs at Snyder and other people who worked on the film. It's bad enough he turned these characters into a joke with his writing but this was cherry on the top of the cake for people to dislike Whedon.,3
I think it’s a little early to say how Joker ages,3
"How the ""my wife left me because of Superman"" is any better than ""my wife died because of Superman""? It seems the exactly opposite to me. He could blame Superman for the death of his wife but not for leaving him.   I really do not understand this theory. It's worst than the theory that the little girl was Batgirl.",2
It’s very interesting,2
"This is how I see it. Could be absolute rubbish, could be credible. I'm not willing to say definitely not when they're isn't enough information to justify it one way or the other.",2
"Again, spell out the conversation.  Lex has nothing to offer and nothing to gain from the lie.  This is purely shoe-horning to make the observation fit, not something that makes any kind of sense in the story.  List how Lex benefits from the lie OVER the death.  Explain why Finch would be more convinced by a walk out over a death.  Explain why Finch would put Wally on air on next to her during press conferences WITHOUT vetting his story which is easily checked. Then list why Wally would agree to risk more criminal charges TO lie OVER the the death.  It makes absolutely no sense.  Regardless of whether Lex sent the checks or not (he didn't :P), under your own theory, he's undermining his OWN patsy plan by making it LESS plausible, by using his patsy's HERO as a target.  You can believe a man will still be ungrateful for his own life... it's a stretch he'll hate the hero who saves his daughter's life.  It fails the smell test as something Lex wants out there.",2
"I will wait for the Synder cut. Maybe it comes out next year, we shall see.",1
I truly despise this thinking. It’s like they willingly ignore the evidence.   “It’s done” doesn’t get any clearer than that.,3
"Difference is, that movie was successful and they didnt cut down a bunch of scenes of Joaquins Joker. They did that with Leto who was then criticized for not being a good Joker. Ben was critically lauded as Batman by most people and even the detractors leading to people being upset when Ben was rumored to leave and then announced it. Just saying",0
That's because that Batman IS LITERALLY Daredevil on steroids,1
"I mean fans raised 100k for suicide prevention.. which is like.. the salary of 2 custodians at WB headquarters? Fans gonna need to invest a lot more money than they could towards a good cause, if they expect to actually fund the VFX for this movie, it's marketing and re-release..",2
"Sigh, it's been pretty much universally accepted he wasn't a good fit for Lex. Even if it wasn't, I personally didn't think he worked.",0
Junkie XL confirmed that he had the score completed before Snyder's departure,2
Hopefully there is enough funds to change Steppenwolf to the BvS design.,2
This is a message board. Not an echo chamber. Thanks.,1

Didnt know this was him but its clearly his style.   He is my favorite comic artist. And when he worked with Brian Azzarello there is no comparison,2
Nobody bullied anyone more than Snyder fanatics harassing DC execs on twitter throughout.  Forget this shit cut. He was given all the chances multiple times and he screwed it up.  Now he can stay in his hole Vero.,1

Get to know the box office more before you make a thread like this,1
"Sums what up? Having to kill Zod? Him being responsible for bringing Zod here by triggering the scout ship? Him having to destroy the last hope to resurrect krypton? Thousands of people dying during a fight that he brought to earth?  \- How he felt after having to kill Zod.  &#x200B;  A lot of complex and monumental things happened that day. A single anguished scream doesn't really count as meaningful or interesting reflection on that imo. There should have been some sign in BvS or the end of MOS that he actually still gives a crap about the things that happened that day. Eating his hero cake but dreaming about the horses.  \- It's quite common for a movie to end and us not see the verbal reflection a character has on what happened. Especially in the sequel if it's months/years later.  We've been through the journey with them. A lot of it is implied.  &#x200B;  Sure. But none of those things mean it makes sense that he'd push Batman down a street and then smash him through a building instead of the obvious option to just hold him down and tell him that his mother is in danger. Showing us him trying to reason with Batman doesn't carry water if his efforts to do so are totally nonsensical.  \- Batman wasn't go to listen to any reason.  &#x200B;  He didn't know that at that point. He decided it was time for.... reasons.  Not powerful enough to stop Diana chopping it's arm off. And if you go back and watch it Superman is shown looking in the direction of the fight when she does that without krytonite right before he decides to fly off with the spear. So if you want to argue that he used his supervision to assess the situation then he clearly made a bad assessment because he saw doomsday significantly damaged by WW right before he makes that choice.  \- Superman was watching when Wonder Woman cut his hand off but then he swatted her away like a fly and then continued to grow and become stronger about to release another wave of energy.  &#x200B;  He rolled the dice on Bruce surviving the first time Doomsday exploded. If he was worried about the safety of Bruce or Lois or worried about Doomsday escaping then they should have shown actually shown that line of reasoning either through dialogue or visual cues. Have him arrive with the spear, see Bruce cowering without cover, see diana struggling to contain Doomsday and *then* decide to fly directly at it.  \- Why does that line of reasoning have to be verbalised? Why do we need to see Wonder Woman cowering? It might have made it better for but for me I simply don't need that. Did you see what the shockwave did to the city on top of Lex-Corp tower? The shockwaves were very powerful. He needed to be stopped. He knew he was a massive threat, he needed to be neutralised.",1
Incorrect. Kevin Smith interviewed someone who watched Zack's cut in March or April who said either steppenwolf or darkseid try to use the anti life force to turn Superman. Supermans suit turns black as he almost comes under the influence of the anti life but he resist to snap out of it. So the black suit from man of steel returned briefly in that moment.,3
"Totally disagree. There’s way too much happening in this suit. The one in Aquaman is perfect. Simple, accurate and very pretty. Same with Aquaman’s.",3
Is it not obvious enough? Wan had a wildly different vision for these characters and asked for a blank canvas. He met up with Zack to have that,1
Lmaoooooo  Yo imagine this dude saying that shit looking exactly like that....   Fuckin love dark comedy.,1
It’s just incredible to see the amount of stuff that was cut.,3
"HBO Max is worth a WHOLE lot more than home video.  This is another thing people are missing big picture for in the Pro category.  Getting a million people to subscribe for a year is worth farrrrr more than blu ray sales.  Domestically BvS sold 3.5 million units since 2016.(They haven't updated the data since late 2016.)  Clearly most of these folks liked what Snyder was doing enough to bring this movie home.  If 1 million people buy a year subscription for HBO Max it is worth 180 Million.  There is a great many people that would sign up solely to get their hands on the Snydercut.  Not to mention the other DC plans.  (I'm assuming they're going to grab DC universe into their library.)   I will buy the year sub just to thank them and there will likely be a buy a year deal.  Where people that just don't get around to cancelling their subscriptions will also end up giving more than the cost of a home release with just 2 months on the service.  Then they can sell it after it does the rounds on their service for a couple months to people on home video.  Which I will also buy.  But again these companies do their best from people just forgetting to unsubscribe.  Or people buying year subs and really barely using the service.  I have a bunch of these at this point.  I still bootleg just about everything I watch, as I would do with the Snydercut.  (But I still make sure to play the stream on the background when I want to support something, as I will constantly do with the Snydercut.  Make sure they know I'm subscribed for one thing.)",1
"Reminds of a video of a radio station interviewing Snyder, but during the interview they would mute him and/or play sound from a porn video over him.",2
This poster was one of if not the only good thing to come out of JL,3
"That means they're gonna have to kill DCEU Batman. Unless they really want to keep 2 but Batfleck will just be off somewhere that'll never be explained. What would be really cool is if Battinson is in a diff universe and they somehow collide, DCEU Bruce will act as mentor to Battinson. Like Batman Beyond.",1
"It's kinda interesting how they didn't settle on the Atlantian cultural style until Aquaman. In BvS it was influenced by Mamoa's Hawaiian roots. JL it's medieval/high fantasy. Aquaman it's full blown sci fi.  I personally prefer on what Wan went with, it's such a unique visual style, it really pops.",3
shazam is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Definitely the lowest point of the superhero movie craze.,0
So these movies are in different universe. Or Reeves just doesn't care about logic at all and wants to make a movie successful by putting all familiar characters in it.,0
For me Cavill deserved better.,3
"People are acting like this means that only 40 minutes of Zack's footage was used...  So here's my question: Is there any proof that all nearly-80 pages were both shot and used in the theatrical cut of JL? It has been confirmed that at least a few Whedon reshoots have been deleted from certain leaks.   I vaguely remember someone on this sub saying that a total of ~66 minutes of Snyder footage was used, or 55% of the final cut of the movie. So maybe not all of these 80 pages were used?",1
Monáe would be one of my top choices too.  I also think Lupita would’ve been a pretty good one too. She was a fan cast of mine before she eventually went and did Black Panther,2
Pretty much. I read somewhere that it has like 60-80 new/different minutes of footage.,3
"Not everything needs to be dark and have a deep character arc. If there’s any superhero that should be pure and for the good of heart, it’s Superman. Like you said, he is THE superhero. A guy in bright red and blue spandex doesn’t need to be deep.",2
"It tells us that GLC is still a priority, which was pretty doubtful after they announced the series on HBO Max, so it’s nice to hear that at least.",3
"Dead water was in New 52 Aquaman Vol.8 ""Out of Darkness"" story arc by Dan Abnett way before that. DC Metal might have used the same name.",1
I'm assuming that because you haven't given me any and it's clear from your comments you don't even know how the boxoffice works.,1
Ok. I wonder how the JSA will tie in to all of that,1
"Can't believe this guy is trying to compare Affleck's (an A-list celeb) twitter to Matt Reeves. Reeves is a director who barely anybody outside of hardcore fans know, while Affleck is a mainstream, popular celeb with 3 million followers, lol. Reeve's has less than 100,000 followers. Not really sure what his point is.",1
I said what it COULD be,1
Have they mentioned which suit they used?,3
Not many people know that. Some people still believe the Snyder cut is an “assembly cut”.,3
I mean after what happened on Sunday I wouldn't want to be the guy who interviewed Jesse Eisenberg about the Snyder Cut.,3

Your critique is way more generic than this design would ever hope to be.,2
Martha turns into the Martian Manhunter? Interesting,1
"Because he is playing hard ball with the studio to get another movie made. He is still playing the ""Justice League is a funny accident haha"" card.",3
I thought it was Conleth Hill who did it.,1
"Goddamn it I want see him as Superman again. I love Man of Steel, but BvS was just a bad movie full stop. There where some really good performances in BvS, but it was just wrong narratively. Justice League suffered from being the follow up to BvS. It's too bad because we got a glimpse of how good Cavill could be as Superman.",0
And so is Starfire and Gamora. Your point?,1
"Exactly. He made great comic books. However, live action movies, well, he got demoted.",2
Idk I think Bruce Campbell would make a good Jay Garrick. I'd rather see Tom Hanks as Kingdom Come Hal Jordan,3
Does any see him as menacing mob boss type? I know he is a great character actor but I don’t think I’ve seen him be a tough/menacing character. Only casting choice I’m slightly skeptical of so far.,1
"Whilst it was a soft reboot, they also didn’t wait this extended an amount of time before releasing the film. It’s an apples and oranges comparison",2
"You should, it's a great movie.",1
Whoa whoa.   It was never just an “S”.,1
Nicholas Cage would be the perfect Bizzaro,1
This guy made the worst score I’ve heard in the past 10 years,3
"I disagree. Aquaman was a unique visual spectacle I’d never seen anything quite like in live-action before, it had an awesome soundtrack, and it felt heroic, inspiring, and triumphant, even if it was basic or cheesy. It’s about on the level of MoS and WW to me. This is a massive step up from JL. Shazam! was an extremely heartwarming story. It was lower-budget but still had cool visuals, action sequences, and music. Extremely enjoyable IMO. Again, a big step up from JL. Both movies felt like they had way more passion put into them by the cast and crew than JL",1
"It has a different director and writer so you think it would be, Margot Robbie is producing though so if this falls flat it’s all on her.",1
Oh i forgot in reddit you have to put s/ because people don't know when people are joking,1
"Has to be satire, there’s no way he’s serious.",1
"The holiday timeframe definitely helped but It had Bumblebee, Into the Spiderverse and Mary Poppins to contend with.  The competition and marketing leading up to that weekend was pretty heavy.  No one was certain which one would come out on top, and no one was really predicting this level of breakout from Aquaman beforehand.",2
"I won’t deny that, but honestly I think everything DCEU from 2017 forward has felt very early 2000s superhero movie in tone. It seems a little less “wink wink” and a little more sincerely corny than even the Marvel movies.",1
"for one, people saw that gag coming a mile away, hell, people predicted it. and for two, he already used that gag in AoU... i mean, cmon.",0

">You’re ignoring Bruce’s whole mindset. Bruce ONLY cares about killing Superman.  And why that should condition Superman's behavior into going violent himself?  Batman might be full of anger, but for Superman, he is still a mere and frail human being he can kill just for pushing too hard. How it makes sense to push him to ""make him listen"", as you say?   Is like you trying to make a toddler reason with you by pushing him; as angry as the toddler may be, he cannot hurt you, but you'd likely hurt him because you are much stronger than him.  >TIME LIMIT  Yeah. So don't waste time saying ""there's no time"" without explaining what's going on! Superman would rather say ""if I'd wanted, you'd be dead already"" instead of ""I don't want to fight, I'm being forced!"" How you'd explain he has time to say the first line and not the second?   >Superman doesn’t really have the luxury of patience, or really the capability of it  Um, what? What do you mean with Superman not having the capability of patience?  >MULTIPLE attempts at talking  ""Bruce, you have to listen"" ""Bruce, there's no time"" (pushes him instead of talking) ""If I'd want it you'd be dead"" You'd say that can explain anything to Bruce? Why he doesn't mention he is being forced to fight, or Lex, or his mother..?  >To say look, this fight you want is pointless, and if I was here to kill you I would have done it already so just listen  He could just, you know, explain himself instead of violently pushing people in hopes the pushed guy will calm down and listen.   Say, if someone you dislike appears to you and pushes you, you'd be more open to hear him? How is that Superman doesn't realize pushing someone is not the best way to make them listen?",1

Kinda dumb that he has such a hard on for being on screen with Superman when he is the arch nemesis of Shazam. And they really need to get on the Shazam sequel before all those kids get hit by puberty like a truck.,3
"Not liking the theatrical cut does not mean that he likes the Snyder Cut. It also does not mean he is against Joss Whedon's vision of Superman, or that he is for Zack Snyder's vision of Superman. It just means he didn't like the final, compromised version, which is neither fully Snyder nor Whedon.",3
"It's about time , Arrow has been up and down with each season although it's been on a strong upswing since Season 5 i wanna say maybe Season 6.  The Flash for me has been the biggest disappointment 1 great season followed by 3 mediocre seasons. Supergirl oddly enough has been the most consistent for me , Black Lightning i'll watch but idk what they're going for it's kinda just staying at one level neither great or bad just sorta good to watch.  Legends of Tomorrow is a good silly show to watch them jump around from different points in history i felt the magic season was a bit wasted i expected some Zatanna and Etrigan or Mordred to show up along with Morgaine le Fey. And finally Batwoman has been a good start way better than Supergirls first episodes which took some time  to get good",1

"I love you trying to counter evidence by claiming it's an opinion by responding with an opinion, lol.  That's the good thing about facts, though. They don't care about bias!

I'd kill for the DC Equivalent of IW/Endgame :/,0
How the heck superman can pass the spear to wonder woman?? It is obviously wonder woman is busy tied up doomsday and batman is shooting doomsday with grenade in order to give the perfect opening for supes to impale him with spear. It all goes well until wonder woman got slipped up which is rather bad luck case. Plus you can clearly see doomsday keep building energy after wonder woman chop off doomsday hand so the situations is definite very dire there and no time for supes to keep delaying around.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  This tweet explain it best:  [https://twitter.com/Only\_Grey/status/1198837692898918400](https://twitter.com/Only_Grey/status/1198837692898918400)    [https://twitter.com/Only\_Grey/status/1198616894191878146](https://twitter.com/Only_Grey/status/1198616894191878146)    [https://twitter.com/Only\_Grey/status/1192917126677516288](https://twitter.com/Only_Grey/status/1192917126677516288),2

Seeing the model really gives me better appreciation for the design. I know many prefer the Kirby design but to me it is something so alien and removed from my idea of the New Gods I can't help but think that some would look like a monster especially on a Apokalips.   My main criticism with this design was that he was gonna be another grey colour scheme villain and after Zod Doomsday Ares and Enchantress at this point I'd have loved to have seen his armour at least have motifs to his comic book colours.,3

"This is the biggest thing here. Any other actor, and I’d be nervous, but I trust his judgement. He’s not a money grab type of actor, he has to truly like the work he’s devoting his time to. If he feels it’s worth it for a sequel than I’m excited.",2

"There's another point that I think should be noted. Joker is absolutely lightning in a bottle. The vision, the tone, the actor, the character, the box office returns. The awards...  We just aren't going to see this replicated particularly with something like a horror Scarecrow film or a Mr Freeze film. Let's say they spend 60M on a Scarecrow film that makes... 375-500M worldwide. Whether it's decent or not, it will be viewed as a pale imitation of Joker.   OP's thoughts make total sense to me. Think beyond villain origins. I don't think there's any world where a copycat DC film comes close.",3
"I'm not opposed to the idea of spinoffs and extended universes. I am against the idea of the studio shoehorning movies with no scripts or ideas into the movie in currently watching. I don't want to be teased for other movies while I'm watching a movie.  Marvel let their universe build overtime. There was one After Credits scene in Hulk and Iron Man. Easter eggs were sprinkled in the background, not front and center like ""look see? We're cool! We're hip! Please buy more of our movies and invest in this thing that we haven't even began to build yet!!""",1

"The sexist and racists who don't like TLJ are a tiny minority - kinda like the people who literally made fun of Snyder's daughter committing suicide because he made such ""awful"" movies. Classless people, but luckily a select few. Most people who didn't like TLJ just didn't like it for plot, character, editing, design, etc.   And no, I don't really agree because he seemingly incites a lot of his haters. It's one thing for a fanbase to be loud and obnoxious (I mean, let's be honest - how many fanbases aren't?), but it's another thing for a director to stoop to that level. It's like an adult trying to tackle children because they threw snowballs in his direction. It's degrading.   Like I said, it's one thing for him to explain to people why he did this or that... Plenty of filmmakers do that. It's another thing to make posts like ""mah diiiickkkk!!!"" (and yes, he did say that) and expect to still come off as blameless and mature. It comes off as a child throwing a tantrum because people didn't like his movie and it's hard to respect.",1

You could say it takes place in a old time but you can't point to one year in particular so I think it's gonna do a great job at making it timeless so that no matter when you watch it, it will stilll have the same impact when something like BvS, with stuff like Stewart or CNN, it's more of a product of its time",1

"For everyone asking:  “In 2016, Amber Heard came out and said that Johnny Depp had abused her. She included photos of her face showing multiple bruises, and released a video of him drunk and angry, slamming cabinet doors around her, throwing glass bottles, etc.  However, straight from the get-go, her story was flimsy; the video she made was shown to be edited, taken out parts where she seemed to interrogate him and kinda mock him. The reason he was drunk and upset was because he had just found out his mother passed away. Multiple friends and other police officers said that the photos showing her bruises were nothing more than make-up.  Ten days ago, Johnny Depp filed a lawsuit against her. Today, the documents were released to the public.  In short, the documents alleged that Amber Heard lied about literally everything and instead, she was the abuser. There was a time where she apparently hit him so hard that a portion of his finger tore off, then she also allegedly said under oath that she was the one to constantly attack him and this whole thing wasn't for money but instead just to advance her acting career. Johnny Depp submitted 87 sets of surveillance footage of his house to the courts, which show that there wasn't a single case of abuse. There was apparently a few times where she punched and kicked him, with one time being said where he was late to her birthday party so she punched him in the face, etc. Those attacks were regularly seen by friends, security, etc.”  Edit:spelling",3

"Remember what Erik Selvig said in Thor  >He’s delusional. Listen to what he’s saying. He’s talking about Mjolnir, and Thor and Bifrost! It’s the stories I grew up with as a child.  As far as the people in the present day are concerned, it was all just mythology.",1
It will be the craziest DC Comics movie ever made,1
"Do we know for sure if WB actually said that though, or could the people who wrote the article be bullshitting.",3
"Incorrect again. Show me proof. Don't make up fake statements. Quote me any part of my original comment to you where I insulted you. Take as long as you need to realise I didnt. You were dismissive in you're very first response to me where you said "" false to everything you said"" with no further explanation. So please find the proof in my original comment of me insulting you",0
"I don't get the ""caves in"" bit? Is he trying to say that's a reference to the batcave? .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Cos that's pretty dumb",0
Those are not Whedon’s words.,2
I would love to see a  Victor Freeze origin story.,3
1. Have Superman cameo at the end of Black Adam.  2. Have “Clark Kent” featured in Shazam 2.  3. Shazam and Superman be Black Adam.,2
I’m not joking make it $50 a month - I don’t care I want to see the Snydercut and will pay whatever necessary to see it,2
Everyone had Pattinson as the favorite when the shortlist was announced,0
"Please please please please please don’t ruin it. The one time Joaquin does a sequel, I just hope he doesn’t regret it.",3
"yeah, I can't argue that at all...definitely wasn't a big fan of the way they did Doomsday (Krypton did him MUCH better IMO).  The Martha thing was cheesy, sure, but I also felt it was a great scene that made Bruce humanize Clark and realize he was stepping way over the line.  Definitely wasn't as ridiculous as most people make it out to be.",3
"Look, you can downvote people all you want, it's not changing the fact that people picture Leto's Joker with Margot's Harley Quinn. Birds of Prey are even going to have a Joker stand-in who resembles Leto's Joker, so that movie isn't going to help dispel that. While there are tons of fanart featuring Margot's Harley Quinn with Heath's Joker, or Phoenix's Joker, they don't look right together because Margot's incarnation of the character was literally designed with Leto's Joker in mind, the tattoos and the skin dye, etc.   Jared Leto's Joker featuring in one movie has nothing to do with people's perceptions.",1
Did you miss the part where he wants to reflect the comic books?,2
IN FRONT OF THE MILLIONS... ^and ^millions,1
"it's more about themes that they could put in the movies rather than lets make an origin movie about this character,",1
Maybe 20 lbs no more imo. I wouldnt like him too big,1
I'm behind on Watchmen but watching that episode tonight!  I did see the Lighthouse though and I think you're right. Less coloring distraction lead me to just focus on the actor's faces. Also personally I think cgi is much more convincing in B&W. Not that movies by Snyder have had bad cgi but the parademons would look terrifying in that style.,3
It sounds like your next move is a recast. I'm just saying it won't happen.,2
Ok. Snyder had two entire movies and neither really landed with the masses. One scene isn't going to convince me hos would have better than what we got.,0
JL’s design was bland grey mess. They went half in/half out on the face and then sucked all the color out of the design. They could have easily done the humanoid look much better.   Instead we got a close relative to Teenage Mutant Ninja Doomsday,1
"I mean, we dunno what context it was in Vulko can just say he's been holding on to it for him, or he left it somewhere",2
Think Aliens meets Pitch Black in the DC universe.,1
"Not actually a pun from Lex. But this :  "" God is tribal. God takes sides. No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy to deliver me from Daddy's fist and abominations. ""  Soon after doomsday takes birth, it tries to hit Lex and Superman stops the punch.   A man from the sky intervening from fist and abomination.   Chris Terrio :)",3
Lex Luthor looks like a middle aged white guy.almost every white actor can play him who has a little bit of a good physique.his fancasting is very difficult.,3
"The assumption is that making things less confusing makes them less bad. It isn't true. This was a flawed movie from the inception. Snyder doesn't respect the source material, or he wouldn't have tried to cram so much into one movie.  Good for you that you like it. It's ok to like something most people think is bad. That doesn't make it good.",0
"I gave Solo a 4/10 and even that was still infinitely better than JL.  They went from MoS to BvS and suddenly they're all there with a Superman reincarnate. Just beyond stupid.   They should have done MoS 2.   They're doing well after Snyder, and now they put their energy into breaking it again, reminding us of the bad narrative instead of maintaining their good streak.",0
"Thank you for owning up to it and coming around! The tide is definitely turning, and I believe WB will #ReleaseTheSnyderCut on HBO Max. It is inevitable now at this point. If Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck, who are huge names, have publicly supported it, then WB is going to look bad if they don't follow through. Welcome to the movement!",3
"Sure, but in the other hand, Whedon has been shown to be a major creep, cheating on his partners with women on his shows.",1
>because Bruce had a face to face with Bruce  Thats some deep shit,2
"There's a lot of movement on the Snyder Cut, I'm loving it.  In the immortal words of Bane, ""The Fire Rishes""",3
"> 214 mins  Good lord, and I thought Watchmen (movie) was long. I think we are in for a treat if this is true.",2
"We get it, you didn't watch the movies.",1
From all the reports (I know they’re not 100% reliable) it seems like Ezra really was trying to be in this franchise. It’s just taking so long and he does have other projects to do,1
"May it be Whedon or Snyder, I fully agree.  Even for budgetary reasons: the guy is a dude with a beard, shiny eyes and a badass armor. I can’t even begin to describe how much budget it would have said in this already expensive film if they just went with that.",2
"I love Aquaman because of how insane it is, and I like Wonder Woman for having a really nice visual aesthetic all the way through (until the CGI battle at the end). However, Shazam was lacking in the colour and aesthetic department for me, it was a little washed out at times and the monsters were so generic and boring, I liked seeing the whole family on screen though, that was really nice.  Also, don't get me wrong Schumacher's Batman films are not that good, but they don't even attempt to be serious, they're huge budget version of the 60s batman, and I can appreciate that in some way.",1
That would get him sued,1
No push-over but def light on his feet + strong. Think swimmers build. Always been into Batman being the scrapy underestimated power-player.,1
Would be cool to see a Reverse Flash movie.,3
"I mean, whether the in universe explanation for it is an S it not, it’s a freaking S.  His name is Superman, and he has an S on his chest.",2
Those fans couldn't make BvS a billion dollar movie. WB isn't afraid.,3
No shit. Doesn’t make this good casting,1
so is it set in the present day or the past?,1
"My favorite Lex pun is ""Mother of God, would you look at the time!"" After the talk with Clark about his mom lmao",1
"Aquaman was an incredibly fun movie, glad to see Wan had so much fun with it. The style of the movie is so typical Wan, with complex movements during action shots which elevates the action so well. The VFX are, of course, fantastic, total bullshit the movie wasn't nominated for best VFX.  I had some gripes with the film, but I'll save those for another time. This is an Aquaman love post and I'll keep my post in that vein.",1
They probably don't want to admit that they lied or dredge up their past mistakes. They've moved on successfully.,0
"Wooooooooo hell yeah though it was obvious. And don’t forget people it’s DC. Even if not in the current earth of the DCEU, that can change when Flash fucks up things.",3
"Remember, WB tried to negotiate a new deal with Henry and tried to get him to cameo in Shazam, this isn't all on WB. We don't know what kind of demands Henry and his team may have made, and whether or not they were reasonable. Neither side has been willing to budge all these months later, that says a lot.",2
I too enjoy making bold proclamations without any evidence of their accuracy.,2
"I legit made an account to say this. Man of Tomorrow would be the perfect title.   Mads Mikkelson for Brainiac.   If anyone can bring Cavill back, it's JJ and The Rock, plus Hiram and Dany Garcia are about to produce the Shazam/BA corner of the DC Films. Black Adam is definitely gonna be successful. Shazam was fairly loved and the sequel should perform even better.",1
The same company weta VFX did graphic design for GOT too,2
Why would he? He wants his movie be it by hook or crook.,1
"Hugo Weaving as ageless version, his experience saying Elven stuff is gonna come handy when casting spells, also a fantastic voice that we know can be masked but still convey emotions perfectly.",1
Nope. Joker is winding down its box office run. Check its daily numbers and weekend grosses. No chance it reaches Aquaman. It will surpass Aquaman domestic though,2
Hmm not seeing Zack Snyder anywhere on this.  How weird.,3
As a joke,0
"His snort after that line is my second favorite lex moment of the movie behind ""rrrraah"" after the ""I would not let them tell me"" on the helipad.",2
"I think they need to keep Henry Cavill, but distance themselves from Snyder's take and just name the movie ""SUPERMAN"" with no taglines.",1
"This is obviously subjective taste, etc.  But I would say let's wait to see what WW84 looks like. I take with a grain of salt rumors that its a fiasco. But Patty has said how much she loves the 1978 Superman movie. And if she tries to go back to that vibe with WW84 and recapture that magic from another era, I can envision it bombing tbh. I hope not! But that possibility does concern me a bit.   I liked WW but not nearly as much as MoS or BvS (and hopefully Snyder cut of JL).   I'm obviously a Snyder stan, but I kind of liked Snyder's more cynical, worldly, mysterious spy-like Diana in BvS more than compared with the earnest, naive but coming-of-age Diana in Patty Jenkins' film.",1
"Haha, ah that scene.",1
"Behind The Scenes content of any DC film is relevant to this sub. Discussion about alternate cuts of DC films are also relevant. The JL Snyder Cut and BTS posts are on topic just as any BTS content would be for any other DC film.   This sub started off as a DCEU sub and later expanded to all DC films. You will find a lot of Zack's fans here because this is the place where people came because they were fans of Watchman, Man of Steel, and BvS. However, you will also find a lot of people here who are indifferent  to his take on the DCEU or outright hated it. We are an inclusive community.   The reason you are seeing such a large influx of Snyder Cut content is because new information and images has been revealed by Zack, and other people who were involved in the film. Right now there is a push in the fandom to bring the knowledge that the SC exists to the mainstream, and to campaign for its release.  I understand that you may not care about the SC, but you don't have to click on those threads. Instead, join in on any of the Birds of Prey, Joker, Black Adam, WW84, Aquaman 2, and etc.",1
How did he not get Superman?  Why do you hold this opinion?  Please explain,1
"I mean I do agree that the edited Justice League is garbage and Snyder's one probably would be better, the problem with BVS isn't the fact that it's serious, people do actually like serious comic book movies if done right (Dark Knight?) I'm pretty sure it's more that the writing is all over the place in BVS",3
To be faaaaair,3
Batfleck looks a bit chubby in the cowl,0
">maybe you just didn't liked because you're not the target for that movie.   You mean... Everyone.   Oh yeah, that's right, because I'm a cat.",1
"So even with a high-budget TV show, they're committed to a Green Lantern movie, with Abrams’ Company* possibly taking it up, and MAYBE Berlanti getting involved as well? Sounds awesome tbh, and maybe the movie and the show will tie in to each other.  Sucks for Superman though. Cursed role haha.",3
Perhaps all these sources and all that was from before the whole thing went down?,2
Literal action figures,1
I’d bet they believe all the bloggers on twitter that way it doesn’t exist over the people who worked on it too.,2
Wow I can’t believe they went back in time just to film this movie /s,1
What will you people do if the Snyder Cut is released and is still shit?,0
I love how one JL CGI mustache is shown in those compiled pictures.,3
Finished vfx my ass,1
"I don’t like the feel, the dialogue, the overall feel",1
No reality where they cast a new Batman and keep the same Superman. I hate that Cavill got a raw deal as well but the headless Shazam cameo told us everything we feared...,0
The suit is blue and grey,1
also i think Zoe is technically mixed race since both of her parents are mixed.,2
"Forget race, I just don't think this is good casting. I'm not averse to a black Superman, but I really can't see Michael B. Jordan pulling it off.",1
"False premise, bad examples. Try again?",2
Doesn’t the video reference the Snyder Cut AND JL 2?,1
"Say whatever you want, Snyder knows how to film some gorgeous shots.",3
Lex may have told him to lie,0
'Boyscout' superman started with donner and maybe during the bronze age.Goldenage guy was legit vigilante.he had no qualms throwing a wifebeater through a wall.so you say go back 50 year or would mean less boyscout superman.the more you go back lesser he becomes.,1
And that sham is potentially what cost us Affleck. And pissed off Cav-El.,3
"I wish we got to see more of Joe’s Deathstroke (I doubt we’ll see much of him in the Snyder Cut, hopefully an extra minute or two). A Batman movie with him would have been amazing",2
"This isn't Whedon's fault man, if it wasn't him WB would've just got the next guy on the list. You should be angry at WB and showing it, instead of everyone throwing all their money at every DC movie and begging for Zack's cut to be released. Ya'll should be boycotting WB films if you really cared about Zack's vision.",3
Let's face it. Henry's moustache would make the movie 10x better.,3
"Goes without saying, but Court of Owls was fucking amazing.  I'm so happy that I picked that up.",2
"It's a BvS toy and is likely just a repaint so they can make more money for the mold they've used, I doubt this has anything to do with the SC",3
He also makes official content for studios   I think he made some MCU posters and definitely knows people on the industry,2
Great voice. Haven’t seen him do enough dramatic acting to know about that side though,1
"I would love that! I think its also an important movie for Harleys arc, to really show the abuse she goes through and then at the end her breaking up with him, maybe even stopping him. Now since they kinda put that story into BoP, without using Joker, we are never gonna get it tho... which is a shame, because imo Harley seeing that Joker is a monster and fighting back against the abuse is probably the most important and interesting story you can tell with that character.",1
Her voice is pretty much standard native  Brooklyn : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HVzr_aOTYrI,1
One Trencher will be a DJ on Ibiza lol.,1
"Batman and Robin wasn’t hated on because it was a different interpretation. People just thought it was too corny, which happened after the studios were afraid that Batman film before it was too dark. (Sounds familiar doesn’t it?) Justice League was not Whedon’s interpretation, it was Whedon screwing with Zack’s interpretation according to what the studio wanted, resulting in a Frankenstein version of the movie. If Whedon had done his own standalone version that would be another thing.",1
Sorry it doesnt make sense for you but that's how it went.,0
"I’m happy to see others that appreciate and “get” that’s sequence. It pains that epic almost, painterly like art piece. It very much reminds me of he shot Watchmen, which is my fave Snyder and my fave CBM, probably even over The Dark Knight.",1
Doctor Fate?? /Homer Simpson salivating noises/,1
"Yep, this guy shared the comic panel and the scene from superman II   https://twitter.com/DCEUNews/status/819013623091560448?s=20",1
Yah so what superman does not know that wonder woman and batman gonna do that?? All the more reason that superman make a choice to do this knowing he might die and u know what? This is something superman would do  Honestly i don see the issue with this whole thing. You are damn way nitpicky on this  Plus superman did see wonder woman is down when doomsday blast her away for good 40 second or so before superman went on to take a spear,1
If they actually have him do a rock bottom I’d cry,1
"Because that one scene in endgame helped it being the highest grossing movie /s  But I do think Harley Quinn + Robbie has that kind of power to bring in the audiences and everything that has come out even through ViewerAnon, is that is a wild very enjoyable movie. I am hopeful for its box office prospects.",3
Unpopular opinion: I didn’t have a problem with that line. It fit with Batfleck’s dry humor.   It’s leagues better than “I don’t.. not..” which was an abomination.,3
I'm pretty confident they have been closely watching from the beginning. And once the right people were out of the way and the type kept building they took notice and started making moves to see if there was anything to this. But yes this was def carefully planned.   good on Zack. Justice will be served. Finally,3
">Yeah but I think it kind of left bad taste in people's mind  For critics, maybe, but the casual audience LOVED Suicide Squad, and if you have a movie with some of the biggest stars from the first movie, combine that with ""From the Writer/Director of Guardians of the Galaxy,"" I think it's very probable that movie will be a hit.",1
"Big Little Lies* lol, but yeah she was great in it!",2
I mean there’s still tons of issues with the DCEU’s approach,1
"Superman is a white character.  I would much rather see a new character, that is a person of color, get the chance to shine.  Any actor who portrays Superman that isn't white won't be called ""Superman"" it'll be ""Oh the black Superman"".",2
"If they ever replace Amber Heard for the shit she’s pulled, Ive always thought Emilia Clarke would be a great Mera",3
I bet Zack asked him. I bet he asked all of them and only Cavill resuded to do it. Disgusting.,0
">“I can say that as far as I know, Black Adam is not going to be in the second Shazam!, because the idea is that they want to go and do a standalone Black Adam movie first,”  Sounds like it will be before Black Adam.",3
Don't blame Paramount at all. WB ordered the heavy reshoots and Paramount was well within its rights to maintain Henry's appearance for *Fallout.*,2
*THR vs Deadline: Dawn Of Trades*,3
Interesting.  This is the first time I'm hearing about Vulko training Arthur. I always thought Vulko was reserved for the tail end of film where he accompanies Mera before Arthur rejects them and goes to see his dad.,2
"Oh they're going to , Trust me. This is all a marketing stunt to get everyone interested",1
Okay then.,1
DC doesn't give up on these kinds of movies?,2
"They are. Not all movies budget for them. Fox apparently didn't schedule reshoots for their movies, probably to try to keep the on paper budget down. Disney builds that into the budget and shooting schedule.",1
I would rather take my dceased korean (meaning she doesn’t know comic books) 97 year old grandma over heroic Hollywood any day.,0

"> Zack’s version is far from a betrayal and if the audience had stuck with it, they would have seen an epic DC story that fans would have loved. If this were based on a comic or novel, people would have said just wait until the final payoff.  > What we got was basically ending the story after Harry Potter’s second book and decrying that it’s a terrible series. When you come up with any story, you work out the ending and then work backwards. Zack had a great way to end this series.  I believe him. You don't have to, but I do.",3
"I'm a fan of Returns, so a sequel would have been awesome, especially since Singer said that Brainiac was supposed to be the villain in that one. Oh, well.   I don't watch any CW shows, so in case I want to tune in on the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover will it be terribly confusing? I just want to see Routh with the cape again.",2
A bloated mess where Snyder throws away tons of comic material for his own entertainment.  Remember when Superman's best friend had 3 lines then got shot in the head in the fucking desert?,1
"Okay I apologise, I think after being on sub for sometime that's kind of all you see haha so let's start over.  Constantine is originally a book that came from Vertigo, their materials are usually more mature. If you ever want to get to know John Constantine that's where I would start. JC is often saving the world but it's not some grandiose war that he then shows off to the world about, he saves the say but nobody knows about it and he has a very snarky attitude.   John is an asshole who will do whatever it takes to accomplish his goals, even if it means putting people he loves at risk (he is arrogant enough to think that he can still save them afterwards). John has a lot of skeletons in his closet. He has done some fucked up things and he carries those with him.   Batman DAMNED was a very one-shot-let-us-introduce-DC-black-label kind of a book. So I wouldn't base any of the characters involved off of that book. (for example Batman is very different in most books than in BD)   If you want to skip reading and watch some of his stuff you can go with TV series from CW (which is probably one of the better ones) or my favorite are the Justice League Dark animated movie and of course Constantine:  City of Demons.   Enjoy!",1
The writing in Sucker Punch is the best thing about the movie (I'm not a fan of Sucker Punch's action scenes). Same thing for that shitty 300 sequel (its problems are the main character and the bland director).,0
"Not really. The crate guy's brain splattered against the wall. At the very worst, Batman caused concussions and broken bones in the Arkham Games. They really went the extra mile to make it look brutal, yet non-lethal.",1
Could've just peed on it.,2
"Because Papakaliatis is Batman too. “I’m Batman, Lego Batman!”",1
I duhn want et,1
"I think you could argue the very last scene was optimistic, but overall the movie was kind of a downer.",1
"He’s worked on the film and is a frequent collaborator with Zack Snyder. I’d say he may not be impartial, but he is definitely a reliable source for the current state of the film. There should be no doubt that he speaks to Zack or has a direct line to Zack.",3
"The first two acts of Fant4stic Four is actually really good. The third act, beginning with ""one year later"" is clearly by another director's hand. And it's... not good. My guess is it was Simon Kinberg.",3
Someone better tell Tom Hardy,3
Dude exactly! Every time someone brings up any killing in the Nolan movies.. crickets hahaha,1
Thanks dude!,1
"Having the exact same events in-universe make it an in-universe tie. They've made, literally, no mention of a multiverse so what are you even talking about? Your logic here reads like, ""they share the same events so they're definitely not connected."" You have some strange thinking here, bud.",1
Underrated,2
"*cough* ""Fabled Snyder Cut"" *cough*     THR is rather hit and miss with DC stuff honestly.",2
Doctor Fate > Doctor Strange,0

"True, still a big jump in quality",1
One of those companies that can fight back Disney.,1
I believe the history lesson was supposed to open the film originally. They repurposed part of it for josstice league.,2
If you would’ve told me 10 years ago that Aquaman would be the highest grossing DC movie I would’ve probably laughed. Congrats to the King of the Sea,3
I haven't seen that yet.,1
"They flocked to the Donner Cut. Hell, the BvsUE Blu Ray earned 22mil. The SC has even more hype built around it than either of those.",0
"Yes, I thought that was isaacs!  Agreed",1
I know but it’s Idris Elba and imo he’ll likely be a bigger character than Deadshot y’know,2
Apparently he had a pitch that the Producer or Director for his Mission Impossible film really liked,1
Channing Tatum for the stripper one,3
"It was a prototype Flash made to sustain friction damage, it is made of trashed space rocket parts linked together by metal wiring. Bruce Wayne was supposed to give him a new suit after the Steppenwolf fight, not sure if it happens at the end of the snyder cut or JL2, but you can see the older version of that suit as the knightmare flash suit, someone took a picture of it while in the set of either BvS or Justice League.",2
"Personally the Black Adam Dr. Fate should be portrayed by a non-white actor, I could see Oded Fehr wearing the helm. Kent Nelson Dr. Fate I could see making a return in Shazam 3 and maybe a cameo on the second. For Kent Nelson I could see Timothy Olyphant playing him although I do also want to see him play Jay Garrick.",3
"Mark Hughes is the most overrated ""journalist"" out there.",0
"They are not. Only two Batman movies created by Burton were same universe. Other two are reboots with different actors, different tone and atmosphere. Also other two are hated, while Burton ones are loved.",1
2004 👌🏼,1
BvS is still trash.  MoS on the other hand is very underrated.,0
"Garbage goes in the trash  Edit: Not sure if you realize this, but your sub displays on r/all. If you don't want your circle jerk interrupted, you might consider going private.",0
Lawrence Sher deserves at least 10 percent.,1
I thought fan-casting posts were not allowed on this sub? They don’t serve any real purpose. When is the last time a fan-cast was actually accurate?,0
Why was he promoting Ragnarok? He didn't work on that movie.,2
Agreed. There were some good ideas in there. I for one really liked that Reed had constructed a suit to help keep himself together and that he could mimic other people’s faces.   Man. I do hope we get a really good Fantastic Four movie or series at some point. The characters are so great and Dr. Doom is one of the best villains imo. I always thought after Thanos Dr. Doom should be the next big threat.,3
Agree 100%,1
Because WB doesn’t want Snyder’s story,3
"I agree and would add that I don't think a new movie *should* be an origin. I'm kind of burned out on origin movies of heroes who have already had origin movies, and I think a lot of people feel that way, no matter how many retellings we get of Superman's backstory in the comics.  But on the other hand, tying the hypothetical new Cavill movie to JL and BvS is a mistake. WB needs to take a really hard left into new and unexplored territory. They can keep some of that stuff vaguely in the background, but bringing it up would be a mistake.",0
"I mean, MoS and BvS made a pretty darn big deal about Superman being the first superhero shown to the whole wolrd and the implications that carry from it, with most metahumans popping up only after his sacrifice.   Sure they could just ignore the foundations of the very universe these films are set in, that doesn’t mean they *should* tho. I don’t even think they’ll go against their way to downright contradict previous movies, only acknowledge them on superficial levels, like Shazam did by the paper clips. They didn’t need to do that yet here they are.",1
"I haven't seen Solo, would you say it's worse than JL or better?",1
I remember this. I love it. Here's what impresses me the most: Bermejo is self-taught. He has done format art courses. His Joker design predates The Dark Knight and was spot on. This was at a time when Lachy Hulme's (saw him in Preacher last) name was in the mix.,1
Putting words into people's mouths is pretty common in the media nowadays unfortunately.,2
You don’t seem to understand what a character actor is lol. A Character actor isn’t an actor who plays a character. If that were that a case then every actor can be considered a character actor because they all play characters. A character actor is a supporting actor who can play eccentric and interesting or wild characters. It’s very hard to become a character actor because it takes immense amount of talent. John Turturro has spent his entire career playing wild and eccentric characters. He can easily slip into a role like Carmine Falcone and it doesn’t hurt that he’s also Italian. Your right there’s nothing to argue here because you already admitted why John Turturro can do this. There’s literally no reason to be skeptical,1
"LET NEPTUNE STRIKE YE DEAD, WINSLOW.   HARK, TRITON, HARK.",3
At least there's the 'Birds of Prey' on this one.,2
No I am.,0
Wow. I feel like everyone was talking about this when the movie came out,2
"At the time there was quite alot of publicity for it, it was big news when they were all tweeting. There very much was publicity to be had. Doesn't last forever, but it was there.  I used to think the fandom was small, now I'm not so sure. Not everyone is a die hard, not many anyway. But I think the number of people who want to see this movie have grown quite alot. I mean remeber JL was universally labeled as trash, objectively it's a garbage movie. Many, many people are huge fans of the JL, and this was the 1st time we saw them live action,  that's a huge moment. So now people know their is another, complete version of JL that will be objectively better because it will be consistent and competently made. That in and of itself will make it better regardless of taste. I have no doubt now that we know it is far closer to completion than we were lead to believe, if not completely finished. I imagine many want another kick at the can, another chance to see the MF JL in a live action movie that doesn't completely suck lol. Even the people that hate Snyder, what do they got to lose, who doesn't want to see another JL movie lol.",1
You and I remember the dark knight trilogy very differently,3
"Yeah for something that has a fraction of the budget, krypton definately did a good job of doomsday",3
"It’s under best blockbuster, basically a most popular category. It’s fine.",3
Honestly...it's better this way. Joker is the kind of movie that should stand on its own.,2
This won't shut them up. Misinformation and hating on DC stuff go hand in hand.,2
"From what I've seen, it seems like it's going to be an uphill battle for anyone other than Harley Quinn to stand out. I wouldn't mind something like this as a Harley Quinn movie, but I kind of wish we got a less HQ focused Birds of Prey movie.",3
Facts. He'll keep saying it until he can't because by then he would be recast lol.,2
"Not starting to fade, bigger than ever, it’s just “artsy” and low budget movies are typically not shot in 3D",2
"I know for a fact a great deal of it was not Snyder in the first place.  You can also see when the background switches to be more blurry when it jumps to green screen in the middle of their bubble talk.  There could be two different bubble scenes......  But it's looking like it was reshoots, and maybe when we get the Snydercut, we don't see something like that at all.",1
"I'd say it's like Keaton. There never was a no kill rule. If Bruce is okay dealing horrible Brain damage and paralyzing people, why is the arguably more merciful option of killing off the table?",2
Tbh I don’t even care to see a Riddler or Penguin movie. Just make another Batman movie instead and include the respective villain wtf.,3
"That other interview with Jason, Ray and Affleck is also kind of similar.  Just when Ray mentioned Zack's name, Ben lowered his head and Jason looked away.  They didnt wanna lie in front of the camera. :/",3
Yeah Superman is white always been portrayed as such he doesnt need a race bait change. Will Smith has turned down superman in the past cus he said that Superman is white. Its the same as we wouldnt wanna make a film with a white cyborg or white black panther.,2
I’d rather he be Solomon Grundy,3
You're good I didnt mean to sound like I was interrogating you haha.  But you're right that robin hood wanted to be batman haha. I remember amazing spider-man felt like it was trying to be grittier as well.,1
"HOLLY MOLLY!!!!  I have seen BVS atleast 20 times, and never noticed this till today. Would have been nice if her name was Carrie Kelley.  Edit :  Well Interesting however didn't Mr. Wallace says in BvS that his wife walked out on him after he lost his legs?  There are three possibilities  1. It's her and Wallace lied about his wife walking out on him. Lex manipulated him into lying. 2. They're two different girls. ( Doesn't look like though ) 3. Since the photo is only present for a brief moment, they used the same girl for two characters.",3
Read the comics bro!  This poster looks like this shit movie superman returns.   MoS was perfect,1
Matt Ryan is the only Constantine I want,3
It's the police ma'am. Your son's been hit by a drunk driver. He's dead.,3
"At the very least, he definitely had one, very important, better idea.",1
Man he looked so cool here...  Dead- Who??? LOL  A crossover DeadPool vs Deathstroke would be EPIC!!!,1
"I haven’t seen CM but ill say Dark Phoenix isn’t nearly as bad as people say, the reshot final battle is one of the best superhero action scenes ive ever seen, the only problem is studio shortened runtime. It’s not a good movie to end a franchise but its a good x men movie.",0
At this point I look forward to whatever he want. I'm just keeping my mind open and my body ready.  #BRING ME VANDAL FUCKING SAVAGE,1
I prefer the Theatrical design (Fight me) but I'kll be damned if that helmet's horns look cooler then OtherWolf's,0
"I meant strictly social media interaction.   But yes, if they wanted to shut this thing down, they would've by now, wouldn't they?",1
"The design looks very similar (though not identical) to the Communion scene rendition. I don’t like it.   And I don’t get why you can’t be as faithful as possible to the design of the character, and let him be intimidating in his actions.",2
Who knows but these characters have been rumored for awhile now,1
"Seriously when such a news comes it just makes me think have Warner totally lost it it's like they don't know what they want and they don't care about us fans it's all about the money for them wish DC with someone else than Warner Bros, i can't take it anymore",3
The movie would have to be way better than it looks for me to buy any of these.,1
Looks good,2
"You assume I base my observation on just this one article. Just about every iPhone and Samsung Galaxy article is ""New Samsung Leak confirms radically new galaxy phone"" or ""Apple confirms new iPhone"". So yes, the content is representative of the company and, hence, why I call it bullshit clickbait.",0
"Whoever accepted the job deserves ire. It wasn't about the ability to salvage the film it was about replacing Zack. It's like people who say ,""what if the Snyder Cut isn't good?"" They don't get it. It's about Zack's vision and how that was butchered and wanting to see that restored. It's not about some arbitrary definition of ""good"" as if that is the only thing that allows a director's vision to be shared.   I don't care how little help Whedon got it was presumptuous and wrong of him to come onto Zack's production just as it was wrong for Ron Howard to take over Solo. The integrity is lost and a creative was screwed out of what he was hired to do in the first place. WB obviously fucked up but Whedon wasn't exactly struggling with his conscience. If more people questioned it WB wouldn't have had such an easy time getting away with it.  In the end I don't care about the quality of JL. In my eyes it's not even a film worth reviewing because it's not a real film. I actually think quality wise it's just okay but what is the point in critiquing something no one involved cares about? You think it'll help anyone grow as a creative? It's not Zack or Joss' film so who is being critiqued? It's just a mistake that is more of an issue for existing in the first place nevermind it's actual content.",0
I hate to say it... but I think I prefer the Snyder Atlantean armour to the Aquaman Atlantean armour.,3
"WB doesn't deem it important enough to bother replying to. Should be clear by now but oh well.  Dude that hasn't worked for WB for years, is biased and has said shit that has contradicted stuff even Zack has said now and then. His word is gospel truth because it suits narrative you've made up inside your head.  You do you bud. Whatever feels nice. Hang on to it for however long you feel like. 👍",1
"So another example how professionals loved the movie , and pseudo critics tried to bash it ...   &#x200B;  Michael Man's Heat is definitely top 10 for me !",2
Lord of the rings too.,2
OUTRAGEOUS!!,1
"Yes, because I feel like that's slightly typecasting.",1
Bing-pot!,1
So you watch them in that order than?,0
"No kidding. The theatrical cut looks like early 90s CG or something Schumacher would have done in photoshop. I can sympathize with a director seeing his artwork being slaughtered this way. Im guessing someone in marketing got the idea of making more like ""marvel"" and then pushed up the saturation to max.",2
If he didn't take it someone else would have,1
Mr. Freeze,1
"Maybe two; Arthur is supposed to be receiving coaching from Vulko in secret, setting up Vulko for Aquaman. Either he then goes to the Mother Box to deal with Steppenwolf and the Parademons due to invasion, Vulko staying behind to maintain secrecy, or Aquaman does training and at a later portion saves the diver which prompts him to go to Atlantis.  The dead guards were CGI'd by Whedon over Aquaman finding the dead king, a plot point rewritten by Aquaman solo.  Basically, we likely saw Aquaman training with Vulko separately, something he'd do drunk, and then the Fisherman prompts him to check out Atlantis later on, OR Vulko training gets interrupted by the invasion.",3
"What would that change? All that would do is make the movie longer. That doesn't make Superman any brighter. AND SUPERMAN DIDN'T CAUSE THAT DESTRUCTION. The World Engine and Zod did. Zod was the one punching Supes through buildings and whatnot. Also, most of the city did evacuate and was fine.  Hell, we saw a bunch of that in BvSUE where he helps after the bombing and people still complain about him there. It will never be enough.  Look, Superman does need to end up brighter. But having a longer transitions isn't a bad thing. After Crisis rebooted everything in comics, Superman was quite morally conflicted. He only gained that optimism AFTER he died and came back. That's why All Star Superman worked, it was after years of him becoming that way. MoS is his first day on the job and your expecting him to suddenly be like Christopher Reeve who, may I remind you, spent 10 years in the Fortress learning from Jor-El.",2
I fucking hope so,1
"Wait, what? It looks like a dumpster fire because everything looks like shit. The characters, besides Harley, are unrecognizable (though Harley’s clothes look ridiculous too). The posters look like fan made low rent Deadpool ripoffs. The trailer was horrible. The marketing, whose job it is to get people excited for a movie, have failed on every level for me. If it works for you so far, great. It doesn’t for me. At all.",2
I can't believe you just made me want to watch Transformers revenge of the fallen,3
my thoughts exactly. WB seems to be keen on keeping Miller around and I like it. He's a great actor. And they seem to love Hudson since she's on Batgirl & The Flash as a result of her BoP script.,1
"Backup is probably bad wording on Hybrid's part, but I wanted to be specific to their wording. Rejected scores aren't an uncommon occurrence: http://web.archive.org/web/20160615041707/http://rejectedfilmscores.150m.com:80/list.html",2
The point is that the stunt team of Justice League shared an image.  That image perfectly overlays over Snyder's image of the 5 part arc.  The second image helps you distinguish and break down the meaning of his 5 part arc.,2
"I've been hearing this too - Battinson will be a different reboot and the actors that were successful in their roles, or who I guess haven't left, (Gadot, Momoa, maybe Robbie) would be recast or soft rebooted into this \*new\* connected universe (if the rumors turn out to be true I desperately hope that its the latter)",2
That’s a bingoooo,1
I'm talking from Jack Nicholson onwards.    The 60s movie was cute but it hardly counts as it's a spinoft of the series.,1
"Damn, I really REALLY like this design of Steppenwolf! Loved his design in BvS as well!",3
https://imgur.com/a/UvlrPvd  That’s the pre-viz shot of Doomsday holding Superman after they both died. You can see the hole in Supe’s chest.   BvS started with the text “The world is introduced to The Superman”. JL would have started with the text “He has yet to rise” followed by Supe’s death from Lois Lane’s POV.,2
"Snyder has great concepts, like BvS and MOS' stories sound good on paper but he lacks execution",1
">That’s like saying Spider Man can have spider senses but Hulk can’t turn green.  Thats a bad analogy as theyre both part of their ""powers"". A better analogy would be like hulk can turn green, but caps serum or whoever/whatever shouldn't allow them to smoke a cigar underwater. Not defending it, im just showing you how he probably thought of it",0
"Idk if I’d be able to get the woody voice outta my head if he was Jay I feel like he’d be like, “There’s lightning in my boot!”",1
That guy who played Viktor Drago in Creed 2 would be a perfect Bane,1
When did it get announced the JSA would be in Black Adam?  edit: nvm. literally the next thread haha,2
"Give me my 10 episode Batfleck mini-series, WB",1
You’re telling me,2
"Really? I remember a moment in the teaser trailer where Harley falls on top of Ivy, and their faces end up really close to each other. Now they’re platonic?",0
"Wow, that's amazing",3
It's also worth noting he said Whedon was brought in on days notice which contradicts WBs official statements,3
"wb take troll to hard, they should listen to DCEU fans, not blogger",1
Yeah probs,1
"the cast for this movie is fuckin wild, like in a cool unexpected way",3
That’s a Hulk villain I think.,2
"I hate this news as much as the next guy, but consider this, the sequel doesn't have to include Batman. In fact, this is a perfect opportunity for a Harley Quinn origin movie in disguise. Like, the first one is about a broken man gets beaten down by mental illness and Gotham. The sequel should be about that very monster that Gotham deserves, so a victim is a MUST!  And who fits that shoes better than Harley Quinzel? Seeing an innocent woman be slowly manipulated into a criminal path fills with abuse is so so much more real and brutal than seeing a billionaire dresses like a bat. And not like we ain't having a Batman movie in 2022 (or 2021 idk). Plus, Margot Robbie has a crush on Phoenix so seeing them together on big screen will be a damn bless.",1
Snyder has such a great vision,1
I agree. You’re first comment came off as ‘eVeRyONe LiKE sEquEl nO ONe hATe’,1
He would be a good Firefly,1
Imagine believing the actor is to blame when direction and the script were clearly the issues.,1
I just think a lot of people don't look at this from an unbiased lens. I can't take those people seriously. Also people who shit on whedon. Refuse to take them seriously either,1
"I’m not sure how mashing up two pictures, helps us make sense of what your getting at? We are confused here what are you implying?",0
Yeah the movie had interesting thematics and tried SOME things but it still had to be executed better,1
Bit much lol,1
"Their version of Braniac was *fantastic*, too...I'm pretty disappointed actually that it got canceled...maybe we'll get lucky and this new HBO deal will lead to the renewing of Krypton and Swamp Thing, which was one of the best things DC has done in live action in quite some time from my point of view!",3
When people say he sucks at story they don’t mean he’s a poor writer. Falling short at telling a story on screen means he falls short as a director. That’s literally what the director does.,3
Lol you literally have zero taste.,1
No no no f*ck a chinstrap FOREVER,3
TDK caused the CBM craze,3
It's more of a Batman film in the Theatrical definitely   Ultimate is debatable but I'd still say it feels more Batman then Superman,1
Probably going to have to wait at least another Decade.,1
"I’m not talking about his religious themes. Look deeper, specifically into the three main characters and how they make decisions/view the world",2
"Same applies to Superman through MOS, BVS and JL. People thought he was too dark he wasnt Superman. Thats the point, he grows into the Superman we love over the 3. MOS, hes young, inxperienced and unsure of what hes supposed to do and be, BVS, he has more experience, he has learned the concequences of killing Zod and is trying to help Earth, he feels responsible for peoples deaths, like in the courthouse, and isnt sure if he wants to be looked up to like he is, JL, hes come back and traded his old suit for a brighter color beause thats what people need, a beacon of hope and hes finally accepted that thats what he is, he jokes with Cyborg about being alive because theyve both died or been close to it, he understands Batman is the man with a plan and is fully willing to take his orders, immediately referring to him when he arrives ""How can I help?"", he smiles when the job is done because now he knows what hes meant to do and who he is now, hes Superman, the Superman everyone wanted out of the gate, but also the Superman we had to watch grow into that for the first time ever. Lets not forget, this isnt done with Joss reshoots in JL either, Snyder shot Clark choosing the brighter duds and meeting Alfred with a huge ol grin on his face, this was his plan. Hes Superman, he just had to grow into it a bit.",1
**ZLONK!**,1
Im loving everything about this movie so far,3
Well I can submit to that!,1

it's a female dc superhero.,3
"I honestly do not see the same girl. They just look different to me.  On another note, I never bought the idea that your wife would leave you if you lost your legs. Why would they do that? It'd be the opposite. They'd end up taking care of you for the rest of your life. Any married folks here? Say your spouse gets into an accident and loses a limb...you'd leaved them?! No way, you'd take care of them.  The way I was able to get past this is to think that it was his incorrigible despair that forced her out.",2
"What I really want out of DC Black is a low budget, black and white Batman noir film set in 1939.",1
"Maybe, but only for a limited time and limited theaters, and probably US only. Although one can hope they will think about EU folks too.",2
"It's traditionally expected for actors not to criticize their own work, isn't it? If that's the case, then Henry is in kind of an awkward spot when it comes to how to adapt Superman, regardless of which side he might actually fall on about how the DCEU has been up until now. Given how different Justice League is from BvS, he'd have quite a line to walk.",2
>Hell even the first 2 Charlie’s Angels were smash hits.  and the new one is the biggest fail ever,0
How can one still show support for the Synder Cut,1
Bruh this made my day. He truly is the Man of Steel!,1
Who is offended? Did I say I was? I guess you are being a moron by assuming I’m offended,0
Makes sense. Imagine Pattinson trying to fit into Afflecks suit lol,3
"If there's one thing that's consistent to Harley's character, is that she'll always go back to her Puddin.",1
"Its gonna be really hilarious,  if after all this noise, the so called cut is released, and it turns out to be a xmen origins wolverine sized pile of shit.",0
There’s still a couple of annoying ones sadly. I think more people have just grown to allow people to enjoy what they enjoy.,3
They said Abrams company producing not Abrams directing. I'm still holding out hope that JJ will personally direct a new Superman movie for us!,2
The movie does a great job of standing on its own.,1
"As much as I love that man, I think Christopher Heyerdahl would nail the role.",1
"I don’t want to fight you, Slade.",2
Everyone caught this the second lines from the ultimate edition leaked online.   But I guess not “everyone”,1
"Man of Steel IS a great movie, but we can put on it a better take on the character of Superman.",0
"This is the Snyder version. It's the Ultimate Cut of BvS, which represents Snyder's vision of what he wanted the movie to be.   The ""Snyder Cut"" that everyone is talking about is for Justice League.",3
Oh my God that’s perfect,2
Pretty much that.,0
"They exchanged friendly banter over Twitter concerning SW. That hardly qualifies as a ""Twitter war.""",2
I will bet you anything that Hawkman vs Black Adam is the climax fight of this film.  Adam will kill Hawkman cementing him as a villain. The wizard will see this and realize that Adam is beyond redemption and then  banish him to the end of the universe.  Hawkman will reincarnate in a later film and Adam will finally make it back to earth in Shazam 3.,2
"But there are more than just DC and Marvel, i mean Green Hornet was really good, but no one talks about that.  i would say watchmen might be mine, cos it's the most accurate in that it pretty much leap off the pages, instead of just barely following the base line. Not saying anything against TDK trilogy but I would have loved to actually see Year one and the long Halloween live action.",1
"NDAs are never indefinite (even though they can be). the longest for one project is 7/10 years but that's rare. Standard is 2/3 years. Sometimes it is not just about NDAs but just being industry savvy. At the end of the day,  if you still wanna work in the town you might not wanna be known for spilling things when circumstances don't go your way. Based on certain people who jumped into the Snyder Cut movement over the weekend,  I'm willing to wager it has actually passed at this point",3
Didn’t we get that with Hancock?,0
"Eh, in my opinion, full Kirby or bust. They should have just put Cirian Hinds in armour, or hell put him in the classic green Steppenwolf costume. Hinds is a world class actor, and they made him look weird.",3
"Just because it had a couple of lite hearted moments doesn't mean that overall it wasn't too serious... even the Dark Knight had a few of those. Also, it was super cheesy but didnt play into it at all. He shouldve been making fun of himself the whole way. Spiderman 3 knew it was being cheesy as hell, and it was expressed in his actions and the music choices. Most of the DC heroes work well with the dark, serious nature that DC movies have come to be, and Aquaman needed to be 3/4 of the way to a Marvel movie, as he's the most absurd hero of them all. It was only 1/5 there imo. I mean, there's plenty of documentation saying that others hold this same opinion, so I don't feel bad saying it.",1
"If there’s a no nonsense mode and a no jokes mode, a no snyder cut mode wouldn’t hurt anyone and maybe even improve discussions for those that actually want to discuss Snyder’s Justice League. It’s a no lose situation for all affected parties.",2
"I saw BvS before, which was basically what roped me into the world of superheroes, and I thought Superman was cool, but when I saw MoS I had a new love for Superman. He’s not just a goody OP superhero. He has his own struggles too, like any of us.   Not to mention, the score was amazing. It makes me feel like I can fly.",3
I don't want MoS 2 if Snyder isn't involved.,2
"I say make it Lovecraftian, 1900th century setting. Book it",1
"If anything I think Batman will cross 1 billion with ease. More so than Wonder Woman will, if it does. It’s Batman. People are going to go see it.",3
It's not overrated. A lot of people didn't like it. I personally really enjoyed it. It's purposefully silly and cheesy.,2
>I’d you are a true fan you’d accept every version and not be some elitist thinking you are the gatekeeper of who these characters are or should be.  You people do realize that using this argument means that you can't criticize stuff like Batman & Robin right? After all if you're a TRUE fan then you have to accept ALL versions of the characters and not gatekeep. I guess this means people will stop ragging on Whedon's version of the characters in Justice League? After all TRUE fans accept EVERY version of the characters and aren't elitist gatekeepers.,1
That's why don't assume every interview is just made up. Just be weary that it has happened before.,0
Please tell me you dont think the Snyder cut would make a billion dollars if released.  Please tell me you aren’t that delusional,2
That’d make a lot of sense actually.   Let’s hope it’s not something that contradicts previous movies.,1
I can actually sit back and enjoy Superman Returns.,2
He gets a kick out of messing with the fans who take all this rumor stuff too seriously. I remember when he was trolling people about playing the Thing.  Mad respect.,3
"More DC Origin / Standalone movies? Yes  Another one from Todd Phillips? Yes, he earned it.  But i want to see other directors visions aswell. Open the DC Black Label movies up to everyone who has a great pitch and make clever decisions. And dont over saturate the market, aim for 1 unique DC Black label movie like every 2 years or so and keep it fresh.",2
Icy what you did there.,3
If Phoenix is in it then it’s a sequel  Also Margot Robbie owns that role. I know it’s an elseworlds but i doubt they’d go that route.,3
"He didn't but they could've ended up with someone even worse afterwards. Honestly blame WB. They were stupid to want the Avengers 2.0 so badly they got the guy responsible for it. Then with SS they basically realized half way through they actually wanted GoTG, and guess who they got to make the next one now lol",2
"So Superman is happiness and hope? Not sacrifice? Choice? The betterment of mankind? Resilience? Empathy and understanding?  No, you boil him down to two incredibly basic ideas with no depth. He’s here to service you. To give you hope and make you happy. And if he can’t do those things, he’s not Superman.",2
Yeah this movie was definitely going to be more Peter Jackson than MCU,3
The Eric Border shocker was amazing,2
He said a little bigger. Ain’t nothing wrong with gaining a little 10 pounds for the role.,2
"It most definitely is an opinion. Her tweet could be interpreted as WB's side wanting Superman to show up in Black Adam 2, and the Rock wanting him to show up in one of his movies at some point (whether it be in a Black Adam film or one of the Shazam sequels). You are making a leap and believing that the first part of her statement  > I'm hearing that Superman wouldn't show up until Black Adam 2  is her talking about what the Rock wants, because of the rest of the tweet. That's completely fair for you to interpret it that way. But it is also completely fair to interpret it as the first part referring to WB, while the second part of the statement mentioning the Rock to be referring to what the Rock wants. The way she worded the tweet does not absolutely imply that she is talking about what the Rock wants, only. You seem to think that her wording leads to only your interpretation, but respectfully, it does not.  And as far as her being awful, I've never followed her on Twitter or YouTube, but the rumors and claims that people have posted from her seem to be very unreliable, in large part. That's why I called her a lower-level scooper. I'll take your word for it that she is awful, haha. A lot of what I have seen shared from her tweets or videos does seem awful.",1
Nolan's being over designed doesn't take away from the fact that this one is too is the point. Nolan's has nothing to do with this.,1
"That would then mean darkseid would be humanised as well...  Lol, do you want it to be like the MCU then?.",1
Wrong on the part of Smallville. JSA was actually in CW's Legends of Tomorrow which was a Arrowverse show and JSA had big moments.,1
"Not much in the article is new for us folks. But few things:  \- I would be down for Michael B Jordan Superman if it is a 'Into the Spiderverse' type of movie. If I recall, the black Superman was leading the multiverse team in Grant Morrison's Multiversity  \- Walter Hamada seems to be doing good so far handling DC films. BoP and Suicide Squad are  unique but they need to bring out the (non-Batman) big guns sooner than later eg. Flash solo, GL, Justice League Dark, etc  \- Most likely they're gonna keep it separate but I would love it if the HBO Max GL series complements the GL movie. The movie could focus on Hal or Hal & John while the series will explore the other GL Corps members.  \- Wouldn't be surprised if the Trench movie ends up in HBO Max.  \- No mention of 'New Gods'",2
"Oh how convenient, the person who actually worked on the film is less reliable about what happened than the unnamed source that parroted the same nonsense of last year.   Sure thing bud, it’s all in my head. Very fitting of you to deny facts that go against what you believe in and then lecture others for doing the exact same thing when they aren’t. 👍🏻",2
"Yes, that is how a real corporation would go about a situation that has even the remotest chance of being “sticky”: a memo giving the directive of no interaction or comment on the thing in question.",0

"Like Cable, who's hair is white from the techno-virus. They decided to make his hair dark with some grey in it, probably because solid white would've looked fake and just not good in live-action.",1
Somebody reply back with a pic of the Joss Whedon version I wanna see the difference compared to this pic.,3
Deep down I always knew that Billy was a jabroni.,1
Now that’s how u make a superhero suit 😍,2
It's just a horror movie that will have the trench as the scary monster. That's all. James Wan probably wants one of his horror proteges directing it. Itll be fairly cheap budget wise for a CBM and do decent numbers cause horror movies earn a lot these days.,3
I’ve literally been saying this since Solo came out. Glad I’m not alone,1
"I think it’s a Superman movie told from Batman’s perspective until the climax. In a lot of ways, Batman is the antagonist for most of the film, but the framing paints Superman in his paranoid point of view.",1
"I used to think Manu's mask looked good when he was in the show but now I googled it and yeah, next to Titans' one and especially this, it really does look cheap. I love Manu's performance though.

Love all that science they use with their science-y words in those sci-fi Harry Potter movies lol,1

In the words of GlaDOS:  *You Monster...*,2
"Kinda funny you would use For Tomorrow where he goes to priest and say "" I'm confessing to you because I know you will soon die "" which is overall darker than most of the DCEU  And as you say, it might be necessary for a story.

"Ummm I suppose a little more batman.  Story wise it's a little more Superman, tonally it's far more Batman, but what makes it lean towards it being more of a Batman film is....well.....is because they don't give Clark many lines.  we understand where Batman is coming from and his motivations are externalize, but we don't get too much of that from Clark, and I get he's a more introspective character here still figuring  out his place and actions, but despite being a big BvS fan I still do feel that Clark needed more to say.",1
"Yeah, that was pretty lazy, considering he did that with Banner falling on Natasha's boobs in AoU.",2
"I expect downvotes, but I still wish that there was more rhyme and reason to the characters the DCEU was introducing. Still wish that there were crossover movies and an overarching plot arc in the manner of the MCU. Still wish that there was... just more of a sense of direction and purpose, you know? Between *Aquaman*, *Shazam!*, *Birds of Prey*, a Batman reboot, a Suicide Squad reboot, Black Adam, New Gods, Flashpoint, and a Trench spinoff among other things, it's hard not to get a sense that Warner Bros. is still just randomly throwing stuff at the wall and hoping that something will stick. At present, there's simply no sense that these individual works take place in the same setting or of a linear narrative spanning them, which makes me hesitant to regard the DCEU as a true shared universe.",0
That is awesome!,2
"That's something I'm considering.  What if The Batman ends up being part of the DCEU because of Flash mucking up the timeline, allowing an in-universe and real-world reboot of things?",3
> would have  Thank you for that.,1
I think I saw Steppenwolf wearing shades at the end. That was a sick instant transmission.,1

That's why I want the SC to come out soon, so there might be some public support behind keeping a couple of the castings.   I also very much want Sofia Boutella involved - she was seemingly involved but was cut out when the Whedoning happened to JL.",2
Actually it's less than half. Only about 40 minutes are Snyder.,2
I cant read comics without hearing him as Darkseid or the dude who did Mongul was also amazing.,1
"By that same token, you wouldn't advocate Clark having a private and personal life at all? 24/7?  When he's having breakfast, he could be out saving the world in multiple places.",1

Makes me wonder if Conroy is the Burton/Shumacher Bruce.,3
Add some armor plating and that’s literally telltales batmobile. I really hope Reeves does something similar.,2
Yeah exactly hence why I felt the need to comment she called this a while ago,1
Tbh I think a lot of people won’t see it because of Robert Pattinson. People still see him as a sparkling vampire. Kristen’s Stewart’s career isn’t doing any better if you look at her current movie’s numbers.,1

"I love the character War Machine and can relate to him in plenty of of the movies and comics. However I'm not upset that he isnt the same skin color as me. Now apply that to a reverse context.

Isn’t that almost like aquaman,3
Meant that more as a general sense in the whole RTSC convo,3
If he’d be allowed too. It’s a matter legally in WB’s hands.,2
I read that he was being pushed out because WB had given up on his vision. Either way I really wish we got to see it come to fruition.,1
Erase Zack Snyder? Why are they doing Aquaman 2 and did WW84?,3
Yes but the core character is still the same.  Changing the characters race to have more representation is being happy with getting table scraps.,2

"Kind of like ""Deadpool"" in the X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie.",3
"Very much an unpopular opinion, but Routh was my favorite Superman.",3
"Leto has been harrassed ever since this role didn't go the way people expected. If he's out I don't blame him.   However,  the plot of this sounds stupid. Harley and Joker are enemies. Harley is to Joker as Red Hood is to Batman. He created her but she defined who she is now. In all media, she's done with him. If we made a movie...  It would be more Harley Quinn vs The Joker. Most people would root for Joker even though you're not supposed to. If we must do it, I'd do it gang vs gang. Harley recruits Henchmen after Joker declares War (gang of Harleys) and most notably her biggest fan Harley Sinn. Joker makes huge strikes throughout but our heroine foils it. She is soon betrayed by Harley Sinn who offers to replace Harley. Dark Knight rises lampoon and Monty Python ""they all get arrested"" ending with Joker refusing to kill her. In her comic, he tortures her but later apologized and promised to leave her alone.",1
How long have you been here?   I’m only saying this because for 2 years I got annoyed with the Snyder cut posts. But what the Snyder people did last weekend caused a dent. In my opinion the Snyder Posts went from undesirable to undeniable.   If this happened during BOP release then I Woukd have a problem but we ain’t in feb fam,3
It looks like a real life piece of shit,1
I just said what we got was shit. But at least he was at least slightly human and had a face. This is is just a video game boss.,3

Don’t forget that in TDKR the spinning punch bane hits Batman with doesn’t even come close to landing,1

Let's not drive this in any deeper.,1

But she's too busy with WW for now.,1
I'm half expecting him to show up in Crisis.,1
"With Pattinson saying all of this “Batman isn’t a hero stuff” and the overt diversity casting, I predict this movie is going to blow more dicks than the fluffer for ‘Bewitched’",0
"I haven’t been following this film’s news super closely but it seems like there are a ton of villains. Like, almost too many villains.",0
Why wouldn't they be in continuity? They don't seem to contradict the main titles. It's not out of character for Superman to do a small act of kindness like helping an old lady.,1
Example of why you shouldn't speak for someone else,2
"Different settings, different worlds, different mechanisms of heat vision. Personally I like the DCEU approach to it, shows how unstoppable and dangerous it can be. Most versions are kinda too elegant and precise for me.",1

And his name too...,1
They are still conisdered to be a part of the same continuity. Michael Keaton was planning on returning in Batman Forever but backed out.,1
"It's not a recut. It's the director's cut. The actual movie. The theatrical cut was the recut since he reshot and recur everything to be a whole different, watered down, shorter movie.",1
"I'm not moving the goalpost.    Obviously a spinoff of a 60s campy show was not gonna go for big level talent; they were using the same actors from the show.    But when it's a blockbuster movie such as Batman 1989, The Dark Knight, etc they go after higher caliber talent. And for Joker they've always gone for Academy Award Nominees or Winners when they're making blockbusters.",1
I don't have a dog in the fight of whether she is buff enough but she wasn't a combat instructor.  She taught aerobics.,1
"I don't believe Snyder was fired.  But I do think it got to the point where the studio let him know that the final product would be very different than what he originally envisioned, so he decided to walk away after the tragedy.",1

"Hey Lois, come check out my new birthday present.",2
Pretty cold if you ask me.,2
"WB trying to bury fan demands for the Snyder Cut, but we won't relent. Having solo universes is boring compared to a shared universe with a Justice League.  So the Michael B. Jordon Superman pitch is real? What is WB smoking... Beginning to think that Toby Emmerlich and Walter Hamada doesn't really get DC characters. It's also really disappointing that Henry Cavill hasn't come to bat for his version of Superman either (best way to redeem him would be to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut). It'd be cool to have JJ Abrams try to keep the shared DCEU universe alive with a bandage somehow.",0
"I think it works for a ""get the big suit for the ultimate fight"" sort of thing, but prefer her in more comic accurate costume for the rest of the time.",3
I like this more than the JL one.,3
"Whether or not it exists isn't the issue, no studio is going to revisit a two-year old flop or admit that they ruined the movie in the first place. Some fans want to rebel and ""stick it to the man"" for lying to them. I get it. However you can not disregard the studio's POV. If you do, then you're basically saying ""I don't care! Gimme what I want anyway!"". That's just childish and not based in any kind of reality.",1
Both designs are awful. This version looks like a dumb grey metal Transformer from the Michael Bay movies.,0
"This is an interesting tidbit:  ""Ballsy Hollywood play: After JOKER opening weekend, Todd Phillips went to WB and demanded access to origin stories of ALL the DC villains...He didn't get it but did walk away from one or two.""

"Here comes WB's damage control spin to halt the Snyder cut. No way would Mr. Snyder make a movie with just dolphin like dialogue. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't want to listen to it either, hence his bubbles for the dialogue sequences.",0
Exactly. Another good example.,3
"Why? It's not like the SC hurts anyone. The Donner Cut took way more work than the SC would need, and that was completed in about a year from when WB decided to do it (2005-2006).",3
Like depends if it wins an Oscar or not.,1
There is a lot of buzz atm mayyyybe they can put it straight to dvd!,1
"Funnily enough, not once have I mentioned that I actually trust the media.   I just said I trust this particular trade more than I trust this particular individual, regarding this very particular piece of information.",1
"I could definitely get behind a premise like this, however I have few changes that I wouldn't mind seeing.  First, there needs to be a Batman, you can't have the JL without the Bat, and whatever form that takes I'm down with, either we have Batman Beyond situation, personally wouldn't mind seeing Terry McGuinness on the big screen, or option two is do a Flashpoint movie first to explain the recasting of Batman.  I would like to see Zatanna  have a role in the movie, but with what you're going for I don't really see a spot for her.  The end credits of JL4 should tease the Monitor or Anti-Monitor in some form",2
> He did the job THEY WANTED HIM TO DO. What is so hard to understand about that?  He did a terrible half assed job and should have never accepted it in the first place. This isn't a hard concept to understand.,0
I always hope for the next Batman to be the best incarnation of the character. I hope he’s amazing!! I think Matt Reeves will do a fantastic movie.,3
I do not care about the social media trending. As a DC fan I only care about the actual films.  Whether they are getting sequels/spin offs and whether the DC universe has a future.  Which I think it has.,2
Well in the Snyder cut Cyborg dies. So it makes sense in the Whedon cut to reshoot group shots where he would be present.,0
"I see your point. The whole situation doesn't make sense to me. Are they ever going to have Batman in a universe then? Because SS, WW, Aquaman, Shazam, and Black Adam are for sure in the DCEU and maybe even Flash since Ezra is still Flash. Might go on a limb here and say Henry might stay too. So why not have the new Batman in the DCEU and soft retcon it or semi reboot it like SS.",1
#MEOW,3
"I just hope the things I’ve heard about the movie aren’t true. If any of the “Black Mask is ultimately after his own nude pictures and that’s why he’s chasing Cassandra Cain” type stuff is true then idk about this one, it could be another rough time for the DCEU",3
yeah i agree the mask and the sword for me are my least favorite parts about the titans deathstroke suit,2
Is that why darkseid looks like an alien... Cool. Pretty sure it's the opposite.,0
"I mean, they did change it for Legends of Tomorrow, so I'd say chances are decent. If they're going with the actual ancient Egyptian route, it gets a but easier to keep.",1
Oh of course you don’t. 🙄,0
"the scene where Batfleck has a scotch or whiskey,  and says,  ""I can't do this forever"" totally breaks the 4th wall, imo.  (you can see him actually smirk while speaking those words)  And that very moment seems to be when he just stops caring.  Worse.   It looks like he wants out, very much like how I felt halfway through that movie.  It;s a subtle moment that seems maybe funny at first,  but in actuality is incredibly sad for Team Batfleck,  and now, possibly, Henry too.  It's legitimately upsetting and baffling at the same time.  Srsly, when does an actual successful and lucrative business/company  deny their customers of something they've totally got in their palms.       &#x200B;  It's like the opposite of everything America stands for.      Endless possibilities is the American way.      Being restrictive, calculative, and cautious to a fault,      sounds like the Communist method.        &#x200B;  I pray that at least one of those dipshit execs will see the light.    Even if only 25% of the audience is calling for this,    at least half will watch it at some soon point.      What do they have to lose?      Tarnish the masterpiece that is JL:DOJ  20 mil?    Pretty sure they lose that on every 3rd film (I'm guessing).      &#x200B;  I'd love to know when that was shot,  and when he decided not to direct the Batman solo film.  Whedon's actions may have caused a ripple effect far beyond that POS movie.  I actually want to kick this man in the balls.  Him, and that dickhead Kevin Fuckyouhara.  Fuck Kevin the most.  I wish Arie Gold was his replacement, he'd greenlight that shit STAT.",1
"Firstly, He didn’t put them exactly. He took influence from them. The situation isn’t exactly as how you described.  Secondly, comic book films mix stuff like this all the time",1
All good choices.  Though Darkseid is such a hard character to cast.  Then again I’d love if Michael Ironsides came back to voice him again. He was too prefect.,2

"I've been a constant CW DC fan since the beginning.  You are correct there have been some ups and downs.  However, their crossovers each year have been amazing.  While I can respect your choice if you don't want to watch the Crisis.  I believe this will be fantastic.  They always bring their A-game for the crossovers.",3
Actually I think it did change how big budget movies are made. Everything (besides actual superheroes) is trying to be Dark Knight now.,2
He looks WAY better there than in Aquaman.  Huh.,2
"Probably will. Reeves is an acclaimed director. This'll be a big hit, and like I already showed using evidence, Batfleck won't harm the film.",1
https://i.redd.it/1p693lsn6kr01.jpg,1
Superman as Calvin Ellis or Val-Zod is fine because they are essentially different characters. But Like race bending Bruce Wayne or Clark Kent is what I'm talking about.,2
"On paper I would say it’s balanced. It serves as a direct continuation to ‘Man of Steel’ with the events of that movie serving as an important plot point for Superman himself. At the same time it serves as an introduction to this new version of Batman and him dealing with the events of ‘Man of Steel’. But when watching the actual film, this includes the “Ultimate Edition as well, I feel as if the movie leans more towards Batman. The tone, cinematography, and the best action scenes all scream Batman. Superman feels inserted in a world that feels more catered to Batman.",1
Well that means he's either the Burton/Shumacher or he's Adam West's cuz Reeve's Superman came out between both.,0
"MBJ as Superman? Cavill is still there, no?",1

"Let’s see this. He kills Hawkman in the final battle and then there’s a jump to the present time and we see the Hawkman in civilian clothes walk by as Black Adam notices him. That or I’ve always thought a Hawkman movie that jumps through time could be cool, Black Adam would also be there and there could be multiple clashes in different time periods.",3
"I disagree on saying that it is still a form of white-washing. If we were to apply that same logic, then one could say that casting Gerard Butler as Leonidas is white-washing, they are both white yes, but they are from different cultures (Scottish & Greek). I think we agree that when casting someone of a certain race/ethnicity for a role that revolves around a certain race/ethnicity it should remain pretty 1 for 1. For instance casting Simu Liu as Shang Chi.",0

Black Adam comes out the end of 2021, basically 2022, so the sequel likely wouldn’t come until end of 2023/early 2024 at the earliest, almost 7 years removed from Henry’s last portrayal of the character.",1

Look to Batman 89 and Dark Knight as examples of the Caped Crusader taking over. I really do believe The Batman is going to be massive.",1
"I wouldnt bet on seeing it until at least about the 10th anniversary of the movie's release, if ever. WB has spent the last couple of years doing everything they can to distance themselves from Snyder's vision and rebuild fresh, and they are finally having some success at the box office and with fans and critics and have a new Batman on the way. The very last thing on earth they are going to do is remind audiences of the Snyder era, and I think people just have to accept that. Theres zero chance of it appearing before Matt Reeve's Batman is well and truly established, and before they do whatever to fix Superman.",0

"I imagine it may have been different in the original version. In a world where we don't have Superman feel itchy, he talks about the ring and likely addresses the end of BvS. Maybe Lois tells him that Bruce has built a super team to protect the world and he brought you back to life and he's sorry but won't admit it. I think it's at that moment, standing in his father's cornfield, that Clark realizes that Superman can work, he saved Bruce from evil, can cast off his doubts, and approach the world with a lighter attitude.  Then there's the final battle, where I believe the third bullet drop symbolizes Bruce on a suicide run, but seeing his new friends beside him, he realizes life is worth living. So instead of ""I don't not like you"" Bruce and Clark can have a more serious discussion about their relationship.",1

Look at the neck snap scene. Notice how Zod stops using his heat vision BEFORE Clark snaps his neck? Zod gives up when he knows Clark is about to kill him. He wouldn't have done that if he was just angry. That's like someone dropping the gun right when they hear another shot go off.,1
">Firstly, He didn’t put them exactly. He took influence from them. The situation isn’t exactly as how you described.  mmmkay  >Secondly, comic book films mix stuff like this all the time  Not good ones.",1
Holy shit this is so fucking perfect.   Like God damn it,1
I see this as an absolute win,2
"Yeah and the writers don't seem to know how relationships work. Its like ""these two characters have the same sexuality, if they meet they fuck"".",2
Yeah no thanks didn’t know Hot Topic was hiring.,1
Likewise.,1
"https://celluloidjunkie.com/2017/11/04/disney-can-demand-65-box-office-star-wars-last-jedi/  Not sure what the conditions are for the sliding cut for the 90+% cuts but most articles from reputable sites (Variety, WSJ, Hollywood Reporter, etc) often discuss studio cuts in the 50-65% range.  Edit: Here's another article on studio profit breakdowns: https://deadline.com/2019/10/joker-profit-global-box-office-avengers-1202767490/  By your split percentages and cuts, there doesn't seem to be a scenario where Joker could make as much profit as Avengers Endgame.   I appreciate the source though, sounds like there’s another side to film rental and distribution that I’m not aware of.",1
"I would watch the Christopher Nolan Batman series   Batman Begins  The Dark Knight  The Dark knight rises   Although they are all action films, they’re dark themed  dramas that put Batman in a “realistic world” as much as possible.   So the pacing will be a little different than a marvel film or the current DCEU movies.",1
"That's not really ""promoting."" That's just one director from the MCU saying he likes another movie from the MCU.",2
"I know a lot of people wanted this to just be a single movie with no sequels, but it would be a crime to deprive the world of more Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. He’s too iconic.",2
Holy shit! My mind is blown.,3
I don’t think he would be for the DCEU.,1
"Exactly.  Had the people not been leaving, they could've just moved the film to march or may 2018 (or whichever viable open spot) and seen those bonuses at the end of the year.   It's a selfish move, for sure. But I get it. They probably thought they were gonna get avengers bonus money regardless before leaving WB.",1
Okay seriously wtf was up with Justice leagues production. This isn't anything like the movie I saw. I mean cuts are one thing but I don't even know where the fuck all the things were cut from.,1
"I just mean from Dawn of The Dead, Watchmen, Sucker Punch, 300 & Man of Steel he made a lot of movies with more standard movie runtimes but I’m sure he has much longer extended versions of those films as well.",1
"I’m glad you expressed your point a lot more clearly in this last comment, thanks.  It’s still built up on suppositions and guess though, and that last analogy is particularly nonsensical.",1
Snyder would have absolutely shown Deathstroke unhinged. I'm still mad the original method for Parademon transformation was cut out.,3
No no no no no If it comes from variety it is LAW. Fuck what the actual filmmaker says.,3
"Yes, some red shades would be nice.",2
everyone looks bland and lifeless except for Harley,2
If it’s properly good comic batman it’s a good chance I’d say,2
No worries. Your apology is received well. Thank you for understanding.,2
"They's not gonna leave, accept it",3
"But did they try it? Did they really? Instead of letting the interconnected DCEU grow naturally, they forced it and then got spooked that they made the wrong choice in forcing/rushing it and are now throwing any idea at the wall to see what sticks.",1
"Woah, interesting. Not at all how I saw it. More like a modernized Superman (in design style) who deals with the emotional/psychological weight of being born with outrageous capabilities and what it means to act in the world with those powers.   It's not even close to my fav movie but thats def no reason to misrepresent it.",2
"So, is the Snyder cut an entirely different movie or what?",3
Sadly.,1
"It should, but money reigns above all for the studio.",2
I don't. Snyder didn't get Superman. Cavill wasn't the problem though. Always better to have someone who wants to do it,2
"I don't know, Wonder Woman had a pretty Snyder ""feel"" to it.  I'm sort of doubting that WW1984 will feel that way, though.",0
">I would love to see your reaction when he is cast as Clark Kent Superman.   I'm a sucker for comic accuracy so I'd be a bit disappointed for sure, but it's not the end of the world, in the same way that Batman not having white eyes isn't the end of the world.   >No way WB greenlight some alternate multiverse superman when they can't get the main one right   It didn't stop them from making a Joker elseworld even though the main universe already had a Joker, and now that they've got a massively successful elseworld film on their hands, they might greenlight an elseworld superman movie specifically *because* they haven't been able to get the main one right.",1
So basically my headcanon is right  Nice,1
Obvious bait is obvious.,2
Lex Luthor is the ONLY name that's recognized and makes sense after Joker.,1

">Using what they could  Except they didn't. Only 40 minutes of Snyder-shot material remains and it's redubbed and regraded. A more respectable director wouldn't have rewritten 80 pages in the first place, Whedon did that. Not to mention a better director wouldn't have turned WW into a heartbroken sex joke like Whedon did.",3
They didn't feel it would look right. CGI isn't perfect,1
I so want to see a Poison Ivy like this  and a Mr Freeze,2
I love that suit so much,1
"Oof, did not like that performance.",0
Awesome. Thank you!,1
"If I remember correctly, Mary Elizabeth Winstead revealed in one of her interviews that   the Huntress in the film has Cassandra Cain's personality/backstory. I may be wrong, since we know almost nothing about the rest of the characters but HQ. Hopeful the next trailer will give us some more info.",1
"Oddly enough, as flawed as JL was, it was an enjoyable movie for me and the one of the few DCEU movies I can watch from beginning to end and remain entertained all through.   My biggest gripe with the whole affair was WB's decision to use Snyder to kickstart the DCEU. When I say this, it usually looks like i'm Anti-Snyder but I'm not. I enjoyed 300 immensely and Sucker Punch is still one of my fav films to watch.   BUT  Story is not the man's strength. It's in set pieces. He would have been a great choice for Batman movies or noir characters within the DCEU. But using his style for the whole universe is what has got us to the point we're currently in. In my humble opinion",1
"Exactly. I would LOVE to see a good movie about Huntress, Black Canary, Batgirl (any iteration), and Harley Quinn. This just doesn't look good...",2
Looking at the ship I think it's more Apokalips based (Makes sense since I think we see one like it in the History Lesson)  Also is Sam the military subplot guy?  That I'm thinking could be Hal's origin but Snyder tends to have pretty large arcs in his films that show differing perspectives (Like the journey of that one guy in BVS or the rumoured scenes with the policeman and Lois),1
"This is a movie, not a comic. And Shayera has red hair, not their ancient egyptian counterparts.",1
"He did the EXACT same ""falling on a woman and saying sorry"" bit on Age of Ultron and it wasn't funny then.",3
Love Jay's comments about the iterative nature of the characters and how the character of Superman was influenced by current events. I also love how he talks about the different levels of experience each DCEU hero had. I think that would have led to a lot of cool conversations and interactions between different characters. One of my most anticipated parts of JL was seeing Batman and Wonder Woman mentor The FLash and Cyborg and imparting their experiences onto them.,3
"Should we have filters for people that dont want to hear about Pattinson? Or for people that didn't want to hear about Joker? Or People that don't care for WW84? No, because the moment you do that, the moment you just start deciding what should or should not be filtered or is relevant enough to stay on the forum universally. The only things that should be removed or filtered are the things that the mods seem inappropriate for this thread.",1
I cant imagine watching movies on regular cable tv in 2019 lol,2
personally i think of it more as a batman film. it starts off with bruce’s point of view and from what i remember he had a lot of screen time compared to supes. the directors cut seemed to include supes more tho,2
"There are none. This ""omg WB would never do it cuz it's like admitting failure!"" argument is stupid.   No. There is nothing negative that can't be buried and ignored by good marketing and fan praise.   If they make money and fans praise WB's grace for listening a releasing it, any poo-poo tossed at them won't really register.",0
Sounds awesome,1
"What about strength in numbers? If it’s true that the JSA will be in there, then The Rock’s Black Adam won’t be fighting just one person. Instead, he will be fighting multiple people.",1
Encouraging!,1
Oh please... Let this mean something good...  We want MOS 2!!,3
Which you cannot prove objectively :) So why even go down that route?! Art is subjective. Just because the majority shares a subjective opinion on a piece of art doesn’t make it an objective truth that its better or worse.   Like for example that horrible “I’m blue dabadeedabadie” song that was a hit in the 90s... is that objectively great music just cause millions of people bought that crap?^^,1
I mean what about Shazam though...,3
"Thank you, Exactly what I'm trying to say. Extra came of very well compared to many of the others.",1
"Well Shazam will have his own mini universe, snyder for the other hand big fat nothing!",2
"Problem with your statement is that other than changing the ending from a fake alien squid attack to a fake Doctor Manhattan attack, Snyder literally made a panel-by-panel remake of the graphic novel.  So if you have issues with the movie, you have issues with Alan Moore's writing, too.",2
"Which one? OG, Post Crisis or New 52",1
">Maybe Mr. J is a member of Falcone's goons  I dunno why, but I always hate the origins with Joker being a criminal BEFORE he became...that the most, because its not a fall. He's not a good man who was pushed to becoming evil, he's a bad man who was pushed to become effective.",3
Pretty much the same myself. The only thing I'm really interested in is Daniel Pemberton's score. So happy he's been landing bigger projects  recently.,1
"Oh, I'm not saying I'm against Snyder's depiction for Batman because he kills, it's just an observation - maybe showing Jason's death would give some context.",2
"I don’t know, from the rumors and leaks it seemed fairly faithful to the Ultimate Fantastic Four, it’s just that the main Fantastic Four story is so iconic that making an ultimate FF story before a decent regular FF movie was made was probably a bad idea.   I’m interested to see Trank’s Al Capone movie with Tom Hardy coming out soon to see if he just had a thought break or he was just lucky with Chronicle",2
it looked... very hard to run in.,2
So much meme possibility,1
That DC comics geek nation guy went on to call all Snyder Cut fans cult members then cry and play the victim card after Jay said it exists.,1
"Yeah I hear you there. I mean why bother if it's just going to look like shit? Especially with Snyder, I mean people may hate his movies, but they can't deny that visually they are beautiful. Would be a shame to release something that looked anything less.",1
"I still have a problem with that line because Bruce is known to be extremely stubborn about his injuries or being in pain in the comics.   A much better scene would've been if Diana tried to help Bruce up and asks if he's alright. Bruce, being the stubborn bastard he is, angrily knocks her hand away and gets up on his own, telling her ""I'm fine."" but we see him slightly walk in pain. Cyborg then would quickly scan him as he walks away and say ""Nope, something's definitely bleeding.""",3
TRANS DIMENSIONAL ...I mean thats some science shit right there LOL. Mysticism is subjective. As Im sure you are aware of the hugely popular quote: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. - Arthur C Clarke,1
Plenty middle eastern ethnic groups are labeled as white on certain forms,2
Some guy was being snobby and just railing on Snyder Cut fans and cracking jokes about people getting worked up over something that doesn't even exist.   Which is kind of funny because Jesse--who seems pretty neutral or just straight-up removed from the matter--said he believes it exists because they shot and reshot content he's pretty sure didn't make it into the movie.,3
"And that time, I meant to say the only time he's killed is during the span of BVS",1
FF will probably be the first Fox property that Marvel Studios makes. I can’t wait.,1
"I thought that was *a* Trident, not the",3
Just make this one another kind of origin story take cues from Goodfellas and do a killing Joke like origin for joker. Or maybe do raging Bull Bane movie,2
"No, I’m pretty sure it’s an original character. That’s what i09 and IGN say anyway. Plus, there’s not really any reason to keep a character like Barbra Gordon under wraps and I don’t think Reeves would want to “re-invent” a character that’s on been on the big screen I think once in a shitty movie.  Black girl does not equal BatGirl (you know it’s true, because it rhymes)  Unless your saying she’s is an original daughter character for Gordon who isn’t Barbra",2
"Took me a while to find it: [https://twitter.com/ViewerAnon/status/1176570446784806912?s=19](https://twitter.com/ViewerAnon/status/1176570446784806912?s=19)  The 5 second shot you're referring to is indeed a body double. There is no info about Jared Leto filming any brand new scenes, although some people claim/hope that Leto recorded audio for the body double scene after he was done filming Morbius.",1
"I'm not even sure what he did *wrong* to SW in the first place. I thought TFA was really solid even if it was just ANH ""remade""  As for Star Trek however that's easily his masterpiece when it comes to rebooting a franchise. That movie is almost a 10/10 in my opinion.",3
"Aquaman's I loved too. It was faithful to the origin comics orange and green, but modernised enough to look badass and like actually royal armour. With the 'A' on the belt for King Atlan instead of Aquaman too, really knocked it out of the park",3
My bad but the original designs for steppenwolf were utilized for the previz - that much has already been proven.,1

"So you loved the majority of his films and thought another was average, and you think it *won't* be better than the trainwreck theatrical cut?",3
"So he hasn't said anything new, other than what those people have already said. So what's new here?",0
Batman teh titties breh you trippin 💪🏿💪🏿,2
Whedon and Johns hijacked the fuck out of that movie,3
That wasn’t going to happen in the first JL movie.,2
"I’m really hoping that DC’s recent turnaround success will help usher in an era of comic book movies with darker aesthetics like Joker. If the formula doesn’t stale with the public over the 20’s, we could see it become the decade of dark superhero movies, right after the lighter toned MCU",1
"I didn't have a point, I had a question.  I'm not very familiar with Constantine, aside from having seen the Keanu Reeves movie, but I have read Batman: Damned, so I was wanting to hear the opinion of someone familiar with what Constantine is all about, and hear whether the version of Constantine in ""Batman: Damned"" is a good representation of what I should expect if I'm looking for other Constantine stories.  I know the internet has a surplus of snarky people just looking to tear into other people's opinions as invalid, but I'm honestly just seeking your thoughts on whether or not the only Constantine material I've read is a good representation or not.  And... I'm not sure you mentioned that or not, but now I'm even more interested to know what you think of the Batman: Damned version.",1

It was more like James earl Jones from Conan the barbarian. The humanoid look would need CGI and not an actual actor. Secondly. The one above with full rendering I imagine would look far more epic than the hound from GoT with two horned hat.,1

Not op but both. Endgame was the culmination of 10 years of 22 movies. And the first Avengers film was the culmination of 5 movies and the whole shared universe thing was ambitious. Justice league had like 2 movies prior to release and literally wanted to copy the idea of a shared universe because WBs execs were greedy.,3

Stop using this as an excuse to act like Joss Whedon's work on JL wasn't awful. Those complaints are valid. Both this underwater clicks thing AND the horrible work Whedon did are valid complaints. One doesn't take away from the other.,1
He’s also really good in Prisoners. As a side note I think Daniel Day Lewis could really pull off Thomas Wayne with that stache.,3
So many people here talking that TDK is a comic book movie They r wrong. It's a awesome crime thriller along the lines of Micheal Mann movies,1
Javier Bardem,2
nobody is giving actual criticism to the film as a film. they're just upset it doesn't look like the comics they read. that's the only criticism that there is for this so far. The trailer is great and really gives you the theme and style of the film in those 2m,1

Yes. That's what I am wondering and I am beginning to wonder if the anti Snyder cut stuff is some infighting style from other directors working on their projects. People that haven't worked with Zack.,0
Should have been Lex Luthor!,1
We will. Mark my words.,2
"Context is key. She was praising DC for being director driven with the Joker movie. Someone then brought up Zack Snyder's JL movie, and that's when she said Geoff Johns is no buddy of hers. Geoff Johns played a major role with the JL reshoots, right? If he was, he wouldn't be a buddy of mine either.",2

"He should've walked into the room holding a hand grenade and screamed at the top of his lungs for ""the whole fucking DC villain phonebook"". I bet he would've got what he wanted.",1
"Gonna take a back a step here since you seem to want it spelled out for you, I'll try to keep it simple.  The defining connection is the magazine about the Black Zero event and the ""Superman is Back"" newspaper in Freddy's room.  We all know that Man of Steel is a reboot of Superman and the launch of a collective universe as was intended. The Black Zero event is, obviously, the main element here. It's tied to the opening of BvS after all.   In BvS, the Black Zero event and Zod are directly involved in the beginning of the story to set up the world around the characters. In that same movie, we have a photo of Wonder Woman that is shown from the first world war and then that is later expanded upon in the Wonder Woman movie effectively tying the three movies together into a single world.  Of course, after all of that, we get to Justice League. Say what you will about Justice League but the ""Superman is Back,"" headline on the newspaper in Freddy's room is a direct reference to him being resurrected within the Justice League movie. Naturally, we have a soft connectivity in Aquaman, whose very same logo is worn on one of Freddy's shirts, to Steppenwolf and the Justice League movie by Mera's comment to Arthur. Now we're four movies into a collected universe, however satisfying may you deem it. Then we get to Shazam.   All of these things being known prior to the movie, there is our Black Zero magazine cover and our ""Superman is Back,"" headline which are direct references to two out of the five movies (let's not forget the Superman reference and the Flash in Suicide Squad), effectively tying every single movie together into the same exact world.  Now I can imagine you may say that the newspaper headline is an allusion to Brandon Routh's Superman but, nay, the Black Zero event did not exist in his timeline, not like in Man of Steel anyhow and we know that Man of Steel is the jumping-off point. Each movie, up until this point, are now effectively tied.  I can see that you may try to diminish these facts simply because they weren't heavy-handed enough, as in-your-face, or whatever you may want to call it but that is not what matters. What matters is that all of these references actually tie and, naturally, they do for reasons stated above.   You may try to look at Superman's cameo or the lack of Henry Cavill's face as a reason why they're not tied but we must remember that the story is what's important, not the actor. If that were the case, then none of the Marvel movies are all that connected simply because Rhoadie is Don Cheadle, not Terrence Howard which is just an extremely weak argument. They could put anyone there and continue the story line, faces don't actually matter in storytelling so long as you're maintaining continuity of the world that was created which, so far, has happened.  As for your multiverse comment, it seems out of line because there's not a single mention of it existing even if it will in the future. Right now, it's speculation. It's a guess. It's founded on nothing except for you, as a fan, being familiar with DC but, if there's anything that's important about storytelling to understand, it's this: if it's not in the story, it's not there. It is the burden of the storyteller to tell you what the world is and how it has changed by the end of each story and, sadly for your take, it hasn't been mentioned even once so to say that it definitely exists is completely disingenuous. It's a personal desire, it's not a fact of the world created thus far. We can get into timelines and things like that a la BvS but, regardless, no multiverse. That's just not how storytelling works. So, when you try to tell me that just because it's not said, it must exist, that's just incorrect. Until it's established, you're guessing and we're talking about things that we already know, not what we want.  I'd be curious to know why you think that these movies are *not* within the same continuity after each of these movies have direct references to each other and after several people involved confirm their connectivity because people such as yourself felt the strange need to ask after the answer was already provided.   If your reasoning for them not being connected is because they didn't show you all of the sequences during the Shazam movie, then you may have an issue understanding the storytelling. It's not necessary to tell an entire story within a story in order to make it part of the world, just the important ties. This is all accomplished in Shazam. What it sounds like, to me, is that you don't like how it's not mentioned through every stage of the movie but, again, that's a personal trouble, not one of the story that's been created.  I predict you'll come back and have some kind of refute akin to your angry responses from before but facts are just facts. This is how the movies tie together. If you don't like the execution, well, that's on you but it's clear as day and you're just ignoring it because... well, I don't really know.  EDIT: ""Superman is Back"" not ""...Returns.""",1
Well with that surface level understanding of the movie I’d hate it too,1

"*The Dark Knight* was not released in China, likely because of the scenes with Lau.  Therefore, that put it at a slight disadvantage in terms of box office.  Fortunately, despite this, it was the [highest grossing movie of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_in_film).",2
WB literally said they had no future plans for Superman as of now and they had someone else do the cameo in Shazam. That doesn't exactly point towards a future with Cavill as Superman.. Especially now that they're rebooting Batman with a new cast.,1

"Just my opinion! Yes he has minimalistic armor in BvS. Tbh it looks better in behind the scenes pics, due to him only being in one scene and it being underwater",3
I'm not emotional towards Snyder lol he is a terrible director lol 😂😂😂   Also did I say somebody hates me?,1
"How can anyone say this is a bad movie? This was such a masterpiece, work of art  Comic book movie fans don't deserve this masterpiece.",1
"I'm normally iffy on racebending main characters, but Selina's been black before, with Eartha Kitt. Even mixed race, if you count Halle.",2
"It's almost as if music in films matter, huh",1
We really went from Chris Terrio to Joss Whedon uh,3
Does anybody have HQ versions of these artworks?,1
"What i wanted to hear! that comment alone has sold me because his back story has always interested me the most out of all the Batman villains, should be great to see it all play out on screen and hope they make the accident scene brutal. I think Ewan will kill the role as well.",1
"disagree, if he refuse and all other director refuse, wb can save 70 million without reshoots alone.  i'm not whedon haters but where his integrity in this situation? marvel studios fuck his age of ultron up but later on he came to DC and try to to the same as marvel studios did to his ultron movie.  thats a low blow he did to another director. thank gos he fired before patty like about his fired new because she knew whedon is fake feminist",0
"All the people asking what happened in the this thread and **you** because you took the trouble to comment and whoever the person named “Who The F” is because like you said, they care :)",1
"""Darkseid boomtubes into the batcave and murders Lois"".....  I swear to god if we don't get the Snyder Cut I at least need to read this original script. Also a couple scenes with a ragtag group of JL survivors fighting in a post-apocalyptic world taken over by Darkseid? Sounds like some story beats taken right out of JLAs Rock of Ages.  We were fucking robbed.",3
">Releasing the Snyder cut would be reigniting Snyder’s fans and likely cause fans to demand they resign him to direct more movies  If the Snyder Cut is good, why not?",0
Again a lot of words and no real info. There is nothing in this article that we didn't already know.,0
"Oh  you're asking for proof from the wrong guy. Hes delusional as fuck. Yesterday he cried about me insulting him and yet when I asked for proof of a single insult he sidetracked it about 10 times and told me to find it myself. Hes got no proof that deadline has the wrong numbers for this, hes just too stubborn to admit hes fucked up",1
"Or Darkseid, and maybe Dr Doom",1
"Seriously. I’m Hispanic and I really couldn’t care less. I didn’t relate to him or feel any happier when I saw him in TAS and heard his accent. Shit, I know of no Hispanics that felt offended that Hardy was Bane. But maybe some people do 🤷‍♂️",2
I can only imagine him snickering as he was writing it and filming it not being able to keep it in his pants. It did not serve the movie at all.,1
**nominated\*\*\*\*** god damnit.,3
You do realize superman is not real right?,0
"I mean it's no real indicator yet, an athlete or a career athlete would be noticeably bulking or cutting by now but celebrities live in a different universe, give it a month of extreme diets and trainers and you can completely change your body shape (obviously not very healthy or recommended)",1
Well even if he played it less safe and went out people still could be dismissive of it. But I get ya.  That’s why I am interested to see how Rise of Skywalker turns out,1
#Releasetheayercut,3
Which is why they may let it happen? It would also mean Joker is in the main universe.,1
Problem is if we start changing and appeasing to every single demographic than that means of some group is not going to be represented and it's not going to be healthy and it's going to lead to the same problems that we've dealt with before that people are having with representation. Hypothetical if you have too many gay people in a show eventually people that are straight aren't going to feel represented and they going to feel isolated from the show because they can't personally relate to a gay show. It's fine having gay people and straight people are shows but you got to make sure it makes sense for the character if a character is gay or the original gay or if it's an original character and you want to make gay that's fine but going insane making a straight character gay not only changes the character because that was never a trait that was part of the character but now you're essentially just making a new character and using the name of the old character as a selling point.  Yeah it's got to be consistent across all media but also I have to make sense to. I mean by the way TV shows and movies clamor over it they make it seem like 50% of the world of the United States is gay when in actuality that's not the case. Realistically that's just not how it works so to have like 50% of like as being gay or something like that then that wouldn't be making sense and you're not representing correctly if you think of it.  Also I have no problem with adding things to the character or adding certain changes to a character but I said I have to make sense or has to be part of a pre-existing trait of the character that develops. Batman and Superman being father's is a great addition to the character cuz both of them have already had paternal instincts and are family men to a different degree and in different aspects one being lighter and one being darker so it only makes sense that Batman and Superman would both become fathers at some point. Yet again it's character development not straight up character alteration,0
"And it pissed Zack off, which can work in his favour, as this sudden increase in photos is building up more hype",2
"Same, its shit now. So is Superhero News",1
So they betrayed the artistic integrity of their studio for no reason.,0
amen!,0
"That’s only one way of interpreting it, which is Jay’s point. There’s the idea that Batman is in denial of the killing he has done, like how he may have killed Joker but is in denial of it. Jay said it was something he’s interested in, but he decided against it for the movie. He also thinks that it’s different with Batman when it comes to kids, he’s willing to toss his rules aside if it’s to save a child.",2
"anytime, yeah I don't haven't so I don't know all that much about it either I just see all the stuff he posts on it on here or twitter",1
Stupid jokers.,1
"I'm talking about tone and nature of the film. You're talking about whether you liked it or not. Completely different. ""Pure shit"" isn't a tone. You could at least make an attempt to understand the point I was making. You said they should embrace how different they are and they have, you just happened to not like that specific film. Doesnt mean they didn't embrace it.",1
"Physically, sure. If he's going to keep the mask on, he should be dubbed over by someone Latin (or who can at least do a Hispanic accent.)  Personally, I think he'd make a better Solomon Grundy. We haven't seen that villain in movies yet.",3
"That's not what I originally wanted, but it's not a bad outcome.",2
"The age is less of a problem with a guy such a Superman, given the nature of his powers.   Jackman played Wolverine until he 49. Dwayne Johnson will be 49 when *Black Adam* comes out. A soft reboot with a 41 year old Cavill is far from a problem, as long as he stays in shape.",1
"“Imaginary Snyder cut” is the exact reason it’s getting posted. I used to be a little indifferent until I found out the fucking movie was done and the effects are done. Look at the shots he posts... it’s always from within the film, not still photography. WB fucked up big time. I don’t think anyone will stop until it’s finally released, and they shouldn’t.",2
How is this news we knew this a year ago,3
"IIRC, Richard Pryor's character in Superman III was originally intended to be Brainiac. What happened to those plans, I don't know.",1
So maybe an unpopular opinion but I actually liked Eisenburg's Luthor,3
Snyder got story credit because he casted Gal and tied it into the other DCEU movies. You can get story credit by literally writing a 2 page rough outline of the story. Patty said Geoff Johns rewrote the final WW script.,3
Could this look any more generic?,1
"No I'm just being pedantic I guess,the film as shit anyway snyder got fucked over and we all lost out because a bunch if critics and get babies wanted a marvel replica.",3
"The other criminals of Gotham probably wouldn't be fans of what The Joker is doing, which is basically just causing a lot of chaos.  The Penguin would offer an alternative.  Crime, with class.  [Peter Dinklage would be perfect for the role.](https://preview.redd.it/t1u3h5mt6qw31.jpg?width=667&auto=webp&s=1c13e6b0c8e500d62c7dd7bf32d3ffa7b8f5e4be)",1
Oh how I wish this happens,3
Yes my boy Dr Fate.  This is basically confirmation now that the film will be set in ancient Egypt with Dr Fate Hawkman and probably Hawkgirl all appearing.,1
"Right, the only assassination involved with Cassie should be her assassinating some dude after her parents assassinate her childhood.",3
"Yeah, but are context clues not a thing outside of the US?",2
I can’t believe I just realized that he was driving a black vehicle. Like the batmobile...but it’s a Jeep,2
"Dude, Lex sent the checks. A) the checks said “you let your family die” B) Lex KNOWS who Bruce Wayne is and C) in his rooftop conversation with Superman he says “Ripe fruit his hate. Two years growing but it did not take much to push him over actually. Little red notes, Big Bang, YOU LET YOUR FAMILY DIE!”. Let’s just get that clear.  Also, Superman didn’t save his daughter’s (if it is his daughter’s) life, Bruce did. Cause even with the world engine gone, it was the fight between him and Zod that brought down the building and if Bruce wasn’t there she would have been crushed.",1
People definitely have one track minds. How many horror directors has WB hired or talked for DC properties recently and how many people have immediately jumped to the idea that they must be directing JL Dark?,2
"I'm with you.  It's baffling how many people on here love BvS. I, legitimately, can't think about that movie without getting angry. It's just so freaking stupid.  Batman is about to kill Superman, a person who he knows is ridiculously powerful and believes is evil and stops because he cares for his mother?? My god. Some of the worse people in history still cared for their mothers, that's not a valid reason to think Superman is suddenly good.",0
"He is literally pulling off crisis on infinite earths on TV by actually showing 3 superman including kingdom come, 2 batman, montior, antimonitor and whatnot. the shows definitely went downhill after few seasons but he's still TV's Kevin feige",2
Just please keep Henry as Superman. I beg you. I almost bowed out when that THR article said he was done. The character means that much to me.,3
Walmart vs Chanel,0
"I shit you not, I think that’s *exactly* what goes through the “MoVe On” people’s minds when they say those two words.",1
"They're okay, but definitely not his best work.",1
"Okay, then everyone in the Arkham games is dead cause they get messed up way worse than the crate dude.",1
"Yes, this exactly!",1
Damn you Didio.,2
They also took a pitch from Christopher McQuarrie and Cavill for a Superman movie. It just came out that Mark Ruffalo pitched Hulk vs Wolverine to Marvel. Just caused they listened doesn’t mean it will happen.,1
1 and 2 yes. Last one? Meh. Imo.,0
Yeah I would totally be down for this,1
I'd imagine something like the Wolf Of Wall Street with some Smallville mixed in.,1
"It had about the same OW as TDK and didn’t hold as well domestically, but did better overseas than TDK did.",1
They also said Ben was walking. I guess that means he’s coming back      /s,0
"The guy’s had numerous ongoings and his  urrwnt oje is about to end at #50, in this day and age that’s pretty good, so I wouldn’t consider him a side character at this point. There’s definitely enough material for a movie or three.",1
"Hears the thing, no one in this society isn't NOT represented. PoC exist in shows, men and women both have leading roles, gay people and been trans people exist in shows. So no need to shoehorn a form of inclusion when it doesnt exist or isnt even a pre existing trait of the character.  The moment you change a character too much to fit a certain quota, then you're no longer adapting that character.",1
Did you even see the deleted scene with Superman and Alfred? This is also Snyder's Superman.,1
"Great point, was what I was getting at but I didn’t communicate it well. The truth is the fan bases overlap massively, it just doesn’t always feel that way with the rivalry.",1
"Yes, but not like Zeus. Considered old god perhaps.",1
Chinese Superman is more likely than Cavill returning at this point.....,0
"Snyders steppenwolf looks nothing like steppenwolf or any of the other new gods, there's no precedent for it, whereas there's already precedent for a black superman",0
"I wouldn't be surprised if we only see Two-Face, Mad Hatter and/or Firefly in Arkham, maybe Batman comes in to interrogate them because a crime resembles their *modus operandi*.  And they can have bigger roles on the sequels.",3
"I really hope he does a full pass on the color scheme and post-processing as well, so we get the desaturated gritty look of the screenshots. The whole compositions and lighting look awesome in BW.   The original was just too artificial, which made most CG scenes look like a toystore.   If this is getting toned down, its gonna give the movie a completely different vibe.",3
I’m gonna go ahead and confirm this too.,1
She spoke to him during the fight scene something along the lines of kal-el of krypton remember who you are.but then supes just fucked her up.,3
Only asked him to remove King Atlan.,1
"If I am being honest I don't think Cavill is coming back, especially if it is a reboot. I don't see any reason for why WB would want to continue with him when they want erase Zack Snyder Dc movies from existence, and why would a new director want him as Superman when he could cast a new one and start fresh.",3
"I've never bought into the pass the spear to Wonder Woman or Batman anyway. To me hhere wasn't time to plan it out. She had him confined with her lasso and Batman had just fired the grenade, the time was now. Superman didn't know he would die just that he might.",3
1000% yes!,1
And many on this sub think it’s a good casting..,0
"Sadly I’ve only heard things about it, but he wrote that ages ago. I doubt he’d do the same things.",2
It’s an app called “Vero”.,1
>	That doesn’t make any sense.  He made plenty of sense before cavill appeared in Man of Steel.,0
"Favorite DCEU, and Superman isn't even my favorite Hero.",3
Exactly. Aquaman and Joker were hits because mainsteam moviegoers loved them.   General audiences don't care about JL tbh.,1
"Makin' movies, making music and FIGHTIN' AROUND THE WORLD!",2
Does bosslogic really know anything lol,2
i dont want a snyder air bubble aquaman,1
In my eyes Aquaman and Shazam are basically MCU films. They would fit right in so in a way I guess this is what the people want? I always kinda gave the DCEU credit for doing it's own thing but I dunno about those 2 films. At least Joker was different and unique enough.,0
Exactly! I see that a lot and it’s not cool!,2
Kaley and Lake also flat out spoiled that in one of the first BTS videos from Harley Quinn   I assume it's in the back 13 episodes that will be released in the summer maybe?,1
"I think asking “is it good” is sort of a fruitless question.  Snyder fans want to see and think a Snyder movie will be good. Not that it’s a rule, but why wouldn’t that be the case. If you like Clark being a loner in MoS, then why wouldn’t you like extended backstories of Barry, Arthur, and Victor being loners. If you liked his tendency for long movies, painterly images, and serious tone, what would even be a Snyder fan’s argument against it.   If you think Snyder is utterly untalented, then you’ve probably made up your mind.  And if one is truly a neutral observer, then I think one owes it to themselves to say the SC would not be artificially under 2 hours. It would not have weird insert shots interrupting scenes. And you just can’t have a polar opposite director remake the film in post.  There’s a scene in trailer where Batman is standing on a grim reaper gargoyle with thunder in the background. In the theatrical cut, that same image is blocked by a plastic tarp. Which version do you think is better?",2
"Wow with the amount of insults you just threw at me, I wont dignify this conversation anymore. Have a good one man. Stay bitter but do better.",1
Your evidence is inaccurate and a false one sided view. Reeves had a few lucky hits but he is an overrated director who can't stay relevant beyond the initial month of the release of his movies.,0
"Well that’s his opinion. The rest of the cast and crew is on board and from what we know of the cut it would change a lot for them. Also, WB just said they have no plans right now. Doesn’t mean they won’t.",2
This is not a flash back scene. Arthur is wearing the same ripped jeans he had on when dodging Steppenwolf's axe and other scenes from that underwater battle. This is the scene which was replaced by Arthur and Mera talking inside the bubble. Serving the same purpose to give Arthur the suit and quindent and get him on his way to help the League. Looks like WB didn't want to stick with whatever Snyder did for the Atlanteans and moved on to James Wan's interpretation.,1
Respectuflly dislike the idea.,1
I sincerely doubt they’re putting on the nipple suit for auditions,1
You don't think if Zack Snyder didn't want to have Superman kill Zod that he could have crafted a way for him to do so that felt plausible?,0
"Look, at this stage, Warner Bros themselves could come out and say that Cavill is still Superman and someone on this subreddit would still claim he's not and give some convoluted reason as to why.   It's like the Snyder Cut all over again. Even when the people involved in it said it existed, people still put their fingers in the ears and claimed it didn't. It's the same principle.",0
I don’t think it’s fair to say people are missing the point if the point hasn’t been made yet...,3
"She is delusional, she thinks that talent = hollywood star, a batman movie doesnt need A list stars to sell, it needs talent, and this cast is full of very talented actors",3
"Tbh i think an Arkham Asylum movie could be perfect especially now since they could incorporate Joker into it for a smaller role along with other villains. I get excited just thinking of a film that houses all these iconic villains together in a single dark & gritty location.   (Spoiler alert)  Not sure if that was supposed to be an early version of Arkham Asylum at the end of Joker but i found it interesting that he is locked away in this place that was bright white everywhere almost resembling heaven when in fact it is an insane asylum that you normally would picture on the other end of the scale, maybe this was trying to tell us something?",1
Yeah it’s seems like this story is rumor roundup they are trying to run as a exclusive.,1
"I didn’t put words in your mouth, saying you have no issue with him killing Zod is not stressing that you like the story. Nothing you’ve said shows that you like the story at all. Now I’m not saying liking a story means you have to agree with and defend everything about it, but you’re very negative about it most of the time. You’re always arguing against something about the movie. The stuff from you about Zack being able to come up with an alternative to killing Zod was kind of weird.   And as for the rest, it’s just ignoring much of the criticism that these movies have gotten.",1
idk. Not sure if I am a fan of this tbh. I really liked that this was just a one off standalone feature. And personally I am really sure where they can even go with a  sequel without batman around. I am also not sure I am totally convinced Todd and capture lightning in a bottle once again...,1
"Wasn't that when Ben was ""still"" Batman, though? Of course, a Batman movie featuring Ben Affleck would be set in the DCEU. Except that Ben Affleck was out at the stage but it hadn't been announced yet, so really that was damage control on Reeve's end.",1
half these peopleare 'still' here,1
For watchmen? Lmao who says that?   Also all the contrivances and weird character decisions in bvs exempt it from being called tight imo,1
"tell Megatron, let’s tango",3
It shaping up to be the biggest DC movie since Aquaman.,3
"I am actually very conflicted. On the one hand I want DC churning out more obscure characters, the Batfan in me cannot wait to see what Matt has in store for us. Also Giacchino making his DC debut. What's not to love?",1
I pity the fools who thought this cut didn't exist. Just look at all of the stuff that's been coming out in the last 6 months.,3
It woulda worked better if Flash hurt his head landing on her armor. Woulda mostly took the sexualization out of it.,1
I'm gonna cop it for this but I think I'm okay we didn't get much Darkseid  I feel like he should show up at the end bu the additional teases feel they'd be out of place almost (Would much rather see this dude fleshed out in New Gods or something),1
Nah Denzel would never do Darkseid and hide behind CG.,1
Animated Series joker has always been my favourite!,2
Motion Capture as well.,3
"Omg it’s the cop from Pineapple Express, just realized this 😂😂",1
To be honest it wouldn’t shock me at all if a reboot with Cavill was already in the early stages of being developed.,3
">I disagree. Firstly, Clark has used Lexcorp trucks in MoS. Bruce has been active for 20 years. It's not that much of a stretch  You dont understand what suspension of disbelief means. It is OBVIOUS that Bruce Wayne is Batman. And in order to make it so that everyone who cant just figure it out ISNT just a massive idiot, you need to act like it's actually a good secret.   So he needs to figure it out, with information the public doesnt have access to.  Or you can do what Snyder did, and make a movie where literally every major character is stupid.     >  >Secondly, Again, Lex has figured out their identities in comics before.   Nobody cares what happened in completely unrelated stories.   >Plus, adding in flashback scenes of Lex's past is unnecessary  Yeah it's better to have the CHARACTER DIRECTING THE EVENTS OF THE MOVIE to be a minor character with his development off screen.   >We already have a full story in action  We have a shitty story that pulls Doomsday out of its ass because the main villain sucked too much to even be the final villain.",1
Got downvoted for that just the other day. I personally think the fact that it was released during a holiday break and had no real competition that weekend helped substantially. It can't hold a candle to anything else on that list and Momoa's acting is just flat out bad.,0
Bigger ? Falcone doesnt have to be big,3
"This design here sucks imo. The JL design was good but, the cgi wasn’t strong at all.",2
The only thing Snyder didn’t shoot was the Lennix part of the MM cameo.,3
I like the 6th and last 2 lol,2
That was from Dark Of The Moon aka the best Transformers sequel,1
I’m genuinely surprised cuz this was all over the place when the film came out.,3
"Not that I think I'll necessarily change your opinion, but I do think you're scraping at the surface of that scene.  Going through the film, we see a jaded, angry Bruce constantly suffering nightmares and PTSD like behaviour from the death of his parents. Multiple times we see an emphasis on his mother's death, be it his father's dying words or his nightmare in front of his mother's grave, he's clearly tormented by it.  This is furthered by the scenes where Bruce is talking to Alfred about the history of his family and how he's now older than his parents ever were.  Working from there, we see Lex taunting him over this throughout the film, notes like ""You let your family die"" etc. timed with Superman at the forefront of a national tragedy yet again (with Bruce **AGAIN** feeling powerless to stop it).  Then Lex starts pitting Clark against Bruce, sending him clues to more of Batman's latest victims, organising to have the branded guy shanked in jail.  So all this pitting of the two together, Bruce sees Superman as the enemy. He's gotten in Bruce's way, he's been the cause of cataclysmic events and some truly horrific acts of terrorism.  By this point, all we've seen from Bruce is his anger towards Superman, his view of him as a threat and absolutely no acknowledgement that Superman is a person too  ""You're not a god, you were never even a man""  This is Bruce's perspective throughout the entire film, that Superman is just an alien, a false god bringing chaos to a place he doesn't belong. He sees him not as a person with a family, loved ones and something to protect but just some arrogant figure who does what he wants.  So fast forward to the Martha scene, where Superman has tried to reason with him and fought back only in self-defense. We get to Clark's dying breath Kryptonite in his face, sputtering out words between breaths he can't catch with a boot crushing his throat.  ""You're letting him kill Martha. Save Martha"". Immediately flashes to Bruce's parents dying, his father's dying words mirroring Clarks, he's standing on the throat of someone who didn't come to fight but came to save someone, and all that person cares about is saving someone else - meanwhile Bruce is about to KILL an unarmed person who's not fighting back - a murder in cold blood.  After about 2 minutes of this scene carrying out btw, heavy flashback scenes, Bruce becoming paranoid, looking around, freaking out majorly expecting *something* to happen*. He thinks he's being played and is losing his shit.  Lois comes rushing in screaming bloody murder, calling Clark by his real name, begging Bruce to stop, saying that it's his mother's name.  You think fucking Batman - **BATMAN** - in that instance would just kill Clark anyway? All signs point towards Clark coming for help, only fighting back when he needs to, and then begging for Batman to save his mother in his dying breath. And you think Batman in all his 20 years experience just goes ""lmao nah fuck this alien"" and stabs him? The entire movie, Alfred is telling him he's not the enemy, Bruce has spent 2 years tracking Superman's interventions - with logic and not blinded by rage he could easily tell Superman is legitimately trying to do good.  tl;dr the entire movie set up Bruce as a tragic, PTSD struck, struggling Batman in a world that's left him behind. On the verge of killing someone in cold blood, for no greater good, with literally any other alternative, he overcomes his rage and distrust of Superman, finally seeing him as a real person with a life, loved ones he wants to protect and not some alien who sees himself as a false god.",1
Wow. That looks hideous,3
True!,1
Oh? You're approaching me?,2
"Yes, that was obvious on the first watch id say.",0
"Its abundantly clear WB is first and foremost interested in a good story, they arent rushing to meet the needs of fanboys like the rush to make bvs, this is why the joker movie happened and ultimately became a success. If a director comes around with a good superman script, WB would be game, and if said director wants to use or recast cavill so be it. Unpopular Opinion but Cavill looks the part, perhaps more than any other actor who has ever played superman, but i worry if he can play the part as well as tom welling or christopher reeves, it remains to be seen.",1
"Look, I thought MoS was solid, and I actually really enjoyed BvS UE for what it was trying to be. But in terms of a connected universe they dropped the ball hard.  Now I’m down for an actual back and forth conversation so long as it’ll be friendly and respectful. I love Superman dearly.  As for Superman, you can’t deconstruct a character before you put in the time to establish the character. I get what Snyder was trying to do with Superman, and the idea would be that at the end of the arc he’d be the Superman everyone loves. I think Cavill is an excellent choice for the character btw. But you have to give us Superman, THEN you can take a deeper look into his psyche. In say his 3rd film you could break him down and do some of the things Snyder wanted to do. But audiences have no reason to care about why Superman feels so conflicted about being Superman because we never saw him being Superman consistently or for long enough.  I feel like Cavill, mainly in BvS, just didn’t have a lot to say. Like he’d be silent so often when he was in the suit. Superman is confident, even if he’s unsure of himself deep down he’s not gonna mope all the time. He’s Superman! There can be moments where we see him reflecting about the weight on his heart, but for the most part he needs to carry himself like Superman.   Superman should inspire people, not make them feel gloomy. And once you’ve got a few movies with him being that inspiring figure, then let us feel for him by pointing out his burdens. We’ll be more deeply connected to him, thus we’ll care about his hardships. You can’t start with sad Superman before you give us time to see him and care about him and just promise that the Superman you love will come later. That’s just backwards.",3
Also true,1
"There's not even a need for that, dude simply has to have a basic understanding of human psychology.  BvS clearly implied that the Joker killed Robin and defiled his suit, that Gotham has a long history with him. If Batman was that far fallen that manslaughter of nameless criminals was no longer an issue to him, someone with as personal a beef with him as the Joker he ***would*** keep alive, just to make him suffer on the long run.  That, or the Joker laid low during the time Batman started killing - which is implied to be either after MoS, or just before BvS. After all, the SS flashback of Harley's capture shows the Batmobile without its BvS minigun.",1
fuck me what a powerful episode,1
"The noes on each mask is very different as well. JL had the nostril patterns while bvs didn't. But yes very much the eyes, JL had a ton of wrinkles around the eyes and bridge of the nose. I imagine to give the appearance of scowling. I wasn't a big fan of it, but maybe that's because alot of batman's scenes appear to be Whedon reshoots which looked like shit.",2
"To what? The stuff about Bruce? Dude, YOU were the one who first mentioned Bruce. I had to go into the stuff about Bruce and Lex to explain that part of it. When you said Lex was keeping the checks from Wallace, not Bruce, I had to go and show you what I’m talking about. That Lex kept things from both Wally AND Bruce to manipulate them both. He intercepted Wally’s checks and then wrote on them and sent them back to Bruce. Bruce wondered why he hadn’t seen them earlier and his employee Greg didn’t know, that’s cause of Lex.   Much of this is just coming from you not understanding what I’m saying. I mean earlier you thought I was saying that Wally went along with the lie to make him look bitter enough to be a Suicide Bomber when I wasn’t. I was saying Lex manipulated him without him knowing what real purpose he would serve.   And again, you’re taking this too seriously. I’m not trying to say this theory is real. I was just going along with it, seeing how the theory could work, what it could mean. I’m not twisting things for some malicious reason or to troll you. Just theorizing. The stuff about Bruce and Lex though, I’m serious about that.",1
"What a group of consenting adults do in privacy is their business, not yours",0
Pretty sure if Phoenix says no then it won't happen since he said that he only signed up for one film.,2
I’m genuinely asking because I didn’t get the impression you did and frankly still kinda don’t.   1. You aren’t supposed to like it. He’s not the good guy until after the BvS fight.  2. That version isn’t the best version of Batman just as you aren’t your best self when your down in the dumps.   If it makes you feel any better I didn’t like Batman in that state of mind either but that doesn’t mean it can’t happen to him and that there can’t be a story about him almost crossing the line.,0

"He obviously struggled with killing Zod that doesn't mean he can't be proud of what he accomplished. Saving the whole world.  Batman wasn't a threat, he was a broken man standing in the way of Martha's safety. He could have killed him in an instant. He didn't want to. He also didn't have a clue that Batman had a beef with him. Why would he? Batman won't listen to him so he shows him what's what. What human is going to argue with it? He's expecting Batman to comply because what other choice does Batman have, after all he can't hurt Superman...  Wonder Woman was already restraining Doomsday and he was about to release a huge wave of energy again and become more powerful. Time was a luxury they didn't have at all. Organising Wonder Woman killing him with the spear isn't an option. The time was now and he took it.",2

"This directly ties into the very opening of the film and the poem narrated by Ben Affleck. I've seen some dismiss as ""sounds cool but is a load of nonsense"" but if you re-watch just that opening sequence, it essentially explains Batman's origin and set's the scene for the 2nd origin/re-birth we see in BvS.  > ""There was a time above... a time before. There were perfect things... diamond absolutes.""  Refers to his time as a young child, a time where the world made sense to Bruce. There exist's a crystallized memory of a perfect time before.  > ""But things fall, things on Earth. And what falls... is fallen.""  Refers to the night his parents died, it's the first fall of Bruce Wayne. The crushed hope, the inability to make sense of the act, unable to answer the 'why' of his parents death and the feeling of powerlessness, all haunt Bruce's dreams and nightmare. He remains broken, filled with rage, unable to make sense of the world, fallen, until ...  > ""In the dream, they took me to the light. A beautiful lie.""  He becomes Batman. The Batman persona allows him to rise (in the dream, they literally fly him out of the well). His years as Batman allow him to make renewed sense of the world, focus his energies on trying to change it for the better. But those years all come at a cost. The Batman was a 'beautiful lie'. We discover throughout the film that he's lost a Robin (the burned suit) and he's seen many good men fall (*""We've seen what promises are worth. How many good guys are left? How many stayed that way?""*). He himself is about to fall for the second time...  The film then cuts to the black zero event between Superman and Zod where we see Bruce witness first hand the tragedy and destruction that cost the lives of his employees, friends, family and countless others. He rescues a young girl who has just witnessed the loss of her parents (about the same age as he was when he lost his).  The experience brings him right back to that moment and he becomes once again consumed by fear, rage and powerlessness. He falls for the second time!  For the rest of the film, we watch a Batman in that fallen state, blinded by rage, becoming increasingly cruel, operating with 'new rules'.  At the end of the movie, we witness his second rise, the 'Martha' moment and Superman's sacrifice being the triggers.",2
"Do (some) people actually want boyscout Superman back? Why we can’t me move past the Reeve films? I mean, they were great (the first two and the Donner Cut at least) but those were products of their time, the late 70’s and early 80’s.  I understand the darker and serious tone of Man of Steel and BvS wasn’t for everyone but at least they gave us a new take on the character, even if some/many didn’t like it.  Besides, we already went to that well with Superman Returns and didn’t work. Sure, it wasn’t a bad film but it failed to re-introduce Superman because it was to busy with “family drama” and a rehashed plot from the first film.",0

Superhero films being dark and gritty for the sake of being dark and gritty has become boring, and I'm glad this is going in that crazy technicolour direction, and with a central character who fits that motif. I want more unique and interesting takes on superheroes we all know and love, not the same films churned out over and over again.  Hell, I'm starting to like Joel Schumacher's Batman films for what they were, they actually had colour and style to them.",0

Honestly I would rather have Batman be recast with no explanation than to use Flashpoint early specially to explain a recasting situation. Recasting happen in the industry and if they’re accompanied by good storytelling people get behind it pretty quickly. Then we can have a great Flashpoint at some point that does r have the burden of trying to explain real world shenanigans.,2

Zack Snyder hasnt confirmed anything and nothing he said has been picked up.   Again. Mark Hughes personally witnessed his proof.   He is writing about his first hand account. When he says the cost to finish the film is basically nothing. That is because he was given the proof to say this.  He tells of how Zack kept working on the movie after he left. He tells of a cut that has been shown to others like Mamoa that isnt some half finished film. But a basically finished one,2

BUT ANYWAYS, it really has absolutely nothing to do with what you’d find as funny or not, but the situation the character is put in. Diana was portrayed as an incredibly strong woman through Zack and Patty, but the way Diana is used during the reshot material from Whedon, it just doesn’t sit well with me. She’s basically objectified through Whedon’s film and it’s disrespectful, imo. One second gag or not, THAT is my problem. It’s more than just a one second gag when Diana is rewritten by someone that doesn’t and hasn’t understood Wonder Woman as clearly known if you read his WW treatment.",1

Sadly, Geoff ""so-called comics expert"" Johns and his goons ruined this evolved Superman and turned him into a total clown.

"Oh, man. Doctor Fate being in this really made Black Adam go from a film that I'm really looking forward to in 2021 to one of my most anticipated films in 2021, I think. I'm really liking where they're going with the Shazam/Black Adam corner of the DCEU so far.",1
">Won’t a lot of vocal fans just beg for a full Affleck “The Batman” movie? I’d love to hear your thoughts about this DC faithful.   They shouldn't as playing batman was clearly a strain on Afflecks mental health, even before JL's reshoots. He's also said that he wasn't able to crack the script.   I'd love an Affleck solo movie, but it just wasn't meant to be unfortunately",1
"> First, let’s be clear about a few things: yes, a Snyder Cut does exist in near-finished form; yes, several people have seen the Snyder Cut; yes, there were multiple edits of the film, including an early assembly cut, but Snyder and his crew continued working on the film and created a more completed version.  > It’s also worth noting that there was indeed a sustained campaign to convince everyone that no Snyder Cut exists, with some people intentionally spreading false information to mislead the press and public, while others spread the false information because they were misled by their bosses or sources and had no other evidence at the time to convince them otherwise.  > I am not sure what compels some media and journalists to continue denying the Snyder Cut exists after a great deal of confirmation, nor why some of them insist it would require tens of millions of dollars to complete Snyder’s version (it wouldn’t, and those claims seem based on the outlets/journalists falsely believing only the assembly cut exists). While Warner could indeed spend some additional money to finish a few elements or tweak a few others, Snyder’s version could be released as-is without additional spending and viewers would get the full film with 90+% completed footage, VFX, and sound.",3

(Unless you are referring to T'Challa coming back from being dust, but that's *everyone* coming back from being dust and they weren't really dead anyway.)  > If we're counting those decades of Pre-Crisis reboot stories, then we can count the Christopher Reeve movies, Returns, Adventures of Lois and Clark, George Reeve, Smallville, etc. 1950s to 2016. Let's say 60 years. Longer than from 1938 to 1993. That's literal decades as well.  See, the only way you win is by counting *all* the movies and TV shows. Which have *already* included the Death of Superman in them. Hell, when the cartoon *Justice League* did it, it *worked* because we *knew* this Superman.

When he dies, *I don't care.*  > Clark has been a Christ metaphor since the Donner movie  No, he hasn't. Not in any significant way. He was more of a Moses In The Bullrushes metaphor, a baby sent away to live on a foreign place (which makes sense as Seigel and Shuster were *Jewish*, not Christian). There have been occasional Christ-like references, but they've never been important.   Snyder, on the other hand, turned the Christ symbolism up to eleven because...uh...wait, because Lex thought he was the Devil. Or something. Lex's third grade philosophy lesson is terrible, too.",0
The trench movie is gonna be low budget. It’s a horror movie. Not connected to DCEU. Horror movies by WB are always successful.,1

Ben only started to seem tapped out once JL reshoots started. Which is understandable because they completely changed his character in the reshoots.

"That's all entirely false. What you're saying is just Geoff's words for starters. That's not 'just' what DC represents. They have far more articulate and adult stories than most main stream comic labels, and they pride themselves on this. MoS has heart, heroics and hope and funnily enough so does BvS. They even have humour. I think WW one was successful because there was less influence from John's. On the other hand SS and Justice League both failed because of him and those campy superhero ideas.   Also suggesting Snyder fans do not read comics is utterly absurd. It's more like the other way around. Most readers and Snyder fans are already aware and have familiarised themselves with campy stories and guest crossovers, thats why comics series such as 'the dark knight returns' or 'no man's land', justice league year one, origins series, all star Superman I can go on and on, are just contributions to wanting better, diverse and well written exploration in the movies such as Snyders.   Zod and Doomsday were hardly video game villains and clearly zod even in death had a bigger part to play. Ares was a one trick pony and he looked far better in Zacks interp. Ffs it was professor lupin, literally!, Still had that stupid moustache the whole time as well!. If anything it was pantomime than videogame. The guy gets it, I'm sorry, but you don't.   Or you do, but you're just one of those 'hate Snyder for the sake of it' people.",0
I can’t blame them for wanting to capitalize on the success of the movie. This is a movie studio after all and this is their long term goal. On the other hand a filmmaker can wait until they have the right story to tell before rushing into a sequel. Which is what I’m hoping is happening.,2
Would you like to see a Joker 2 or birth of a Dark DC movie franchise that ties several character arcs over different movies into a Marvel style series.  Joker is job done for me. No need to rinse and repeat. I feel I got closure with the character because we know after the end it’s high entropy. He’s unpredictable so anything can happen.,1

"We don't NEED to know that because Keefe GIVES it to us.  In the SANE interpretation, where Keefe has been telling the truth all along and is completely unconnected to Sage... everything lines up!  Keefe is absolutely angry at Superman.  That's what the protest is about.  Whether the loss of his legs, family, or both.  It's consistent. [Not consistent is it being about checks, because you don't throw yourself in prison for 40 years as your first move to resolve checks... plus if it were about checks he'd SAY 'Where are my checks!?' and that would start an investigation which would completely resolve this, undermining the idea that this was Lex's plan from the start.]  Keefe wants his TRUTH to be heard.  That's why he protests and that's exactly what Lex is offering.  Clean up and connections so he can tell his TRUTH to Finch... get America to ""wake up"" and confront Superman.  These are all things he explicitly says he wants.  These are all things that are undermined if he's lying for Lex for NO APPARENT REASON.  Heck, in his own words it's about FLESH AND BLOOD... how is a living leaving wife more ""flesh and blood"" than one who DIED in a tower?  All his statements line up with exactly what Lex is offering and gives WITHOUT lying.  If a lie has no motive, then it's insane to insist upon it... if simply the *possibility* of lying is sufficient argument, then I might as well say:    - Sage's mom is alive because Sage was lying when she pointed to the tower.   - Plot twist: Wallace's photo is a stock photo that came with the frame and he's been lying for no reason.   - Lex had nothing to do with anything, he was lying on the helipad.    It's not sufficient to say ""They *could* be lying.""  Yeah, *anyone* can lie... but you NEED means, motive, and opportunity.  The Sage lie lacks means because it's easily vetted, fact-checked, and denied. It triggers actions and rights (if the mom is living, Keefe is entitled to visitation, if his a public figure, they'll track her down so he can see Sage... and when Sage says, ""But my mom's been dead for two years."" the lie falls apart).  It falls apart a dozen other ways too.  It's two years later, they've identified all the bodies by now or pronounced her legally dead... he's been living like she's dead.  You can't retroactively apply the lie to your last two years of living!  It lacks motive because as of yet NO ONE has explained how a living leaving wife is MORE persuasive than one that died directly due to Superman.  It lacks opportunity because Wally wasn't apart of the alleged conspiracy until two years LATER.  He didn't know TO lie UNTIL Lex tells him to under this theory.  So for 2 years he's been telling everyone and acting like his wife is dead... aren't they all going to confront him on that when his public story contradicts that?  No means, no motive, and only a window of opportunity... it makes no sense WHY this would happen and adds nothing to the story!",1

"Gal did not pursuade WB to fire Brett Ratner, her team put out a statement saying so (because the last thing an actor needs is to look like a egotistical diva just because they've had one success).  The endorsements are great for media coverage, but people should be wary of ascribing too much power to actors like Gal and Jason. Yes, they're in successful movies, but those movies are big IPs already so a studio can say 'we could have put anyone in that role and been successful'. For them to have true power they have to prove they are independently successful, like Ben Affleck, or Margot Robbie, or Joaquin Phoenix (if he wants to flex that power).  At the moment they're in the same boat as non-RDJ/Scarlett Johansson Marvel actors. Those guys have billion dollar movies regularly, but they have trouble opening other movies on their name alone.  Of course on the positive side them being allowed to tweet the tag suggests there isn't any sort of aggressive 'No one on our payroll is allowed to mention how badly we did with JL' rule.",1

Superman doesn't feel he's developed much from MOS to BVS despite the fact they do seem to lean in a more hopeful direction in the ending scenes (Cavill has said this himself)   Then he has a crisis of self doubt thanks to Luthor before dying. Allegedly he had some scars from coming back mentally (Not sure how much this is true tho)  Then he turns evil thanks to Darkseid, killing Aquaman and WW while also bringing the Knightmare timeline to fruition.   This presumably is maintained in the JL 3 film to some extent.  So my question is, at what point in this arc were we getting the true, optimistic Superman? At best we'd see him be optimistic in JL 1 before turning evil in the next movie with no spinoff actually following up on this",1
">Problem is if we start changing and appeasing to every single demographic than that means of some group is not going to be represented and it's not going to be healthy.  Realistically you don't need to change anything, just use different charcaters that can represent different groups. And not everything has to represent every demographic, that's simply not feasible, but it's more about a wider representation to the point that these things are normalised, people still think that having a female led film, or a gay led TV show is pandering or ""forced"" diversity simply for existing, and that's an issue. For this specific example, we don't need to race swap Superman, tbh, I don't think many people are actually advocating for that, but that doesn't mean we can't get a black Superman in the form of Val Zod or Steel, for example.   >Hypothetical if you have too many gay people in a show eventually people that are straight aren't going to feel represented and they going to feel isolated from the show because they can't personally relate to a gay show.   Straight people are almost always the norm in a show, and that's mostly fine because straight people make up most of the population, but I very much doubt that it'll come to a point where a show is ""too gay"" for straight people to relate to.  >but going insane making a straight character gay not only changes the character because that was never a trait that was part of the character but now you're essentially just making a new character and using the name of the old character as a selling point.  How is it insane to reimagine a charcater with a different sexuality? Very few charcaters stay the way a writer originally intended, especially when you've got multiple writers over 80 years. I'd definitely prefer that LGBT charcaters get adapted over changing a straight character into one, but I think you're making it out to be a much bigger deal than it ought to be.    >I mean by the way TV shows and movies clamor over it they make it seem like 50% of the world of the United States is gay when in actuality that's not the case.   That's absolutely not true. The reason you think it's that high is because it's not normalised for you, you still think it's different or odd, but that's not your fault, it's because media representation of LGBT people has been rather lacking.  According to GLAAD for their 2018 ""where are we on TV"" report:  ""Of the 857 regular characters expected to appear on broadcast scripted primetime programming this season, 75 (8.8%) were identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer""  They also note that this is the highest they've ever recorded it, so it's a far, far cry from 50%. But again, it might feel higher to you as it sticks out more due to a subconscious bias due to a lack of media representation.  >you're not representing correctly if you think of it.  Good thing it's not anywhere near the 50% number.",0

"Actually fat Thor is very mixed, even though I enjoyed it and thought it was interesting. Plus also it's a different direction of the character after we have seen Thor being super muscular and strong as he always is. This is just a version of the character that steeped in a downward turn because he stumbled into a depression. It's part of his character development and how he's going into a negative State and must regain his strength. It's a big shocker because Thor is typically considered one of the strongest Avengers and is always depicted as this large strong muscular guy. If they had started Thor out or if they had done a reboot where he was fat it wouldn't have made sense because that's not how the character is. Does it mean there haven't been moments worth Thor's gotten fat but to say that Thor should always be fat or shouldn't being a strong looking dude would be a silly argument. Same thing applies with Superman some storylines where he doesn't have as much of his muscle mass like in Flashpoint because he's not as strong. However that's just a storyline or certain form of development where he's not depicted as having his strength but Superman is always depicted as a stronger larger character and that's a visual aspect of the character. You take that away you take away the key visual of recognizing the iconic part of Superman. What people don't realize is that these characters are iconic and part of the iconic aspect of it is the visual aspect of it the visual aspect of these characters that show strong or symbolic they look very strong with their visuals.",1
He liked a tweet that bashed TDK,2
Henry will be Superman again.  He has to be. Plus Witcher will get his name in the spotlight again.,1
The BvS and concept art designs actually look demonic and terrifying. I would’ve loved to see that version over the design in the TC that looks like it was ripped straight from a Disney Channel original movie.,3

"Stuff like that still happens in comics to this day. So definitely not 50 years in the past. Also, that’s one of the main reasons Superman is as popular as he is today. That’s one of his traits. I know teenagers like things to be edgy, but you guys should first look at the character’s background before complaining.

"It’s too messy. The DCEU can keep what worked and phase what didn’t out of continuity. The next Superman story doesn’t have to be an origin, but even with Cavill you don’t have to keep everything that happened before as his history. It was made into too much of a mess by WB AND Snyder.   God I wish DC had just taken their time and done this universe right. I’ve never had an entertainment experience like Endgame, and I know if DC had been smart and patient their eventual “Endgame” could’ve been even better. Maybe one day...",3

"Not even close. He's commissioned just like any other independent graphic artist would be. As far as I'm aware was only brought on to do a one-off for Marvel one time. He doesn't know inside information outside of whatever assets he's given when doing design work that would potentially be spoilers for everyone else, and even then there could be some kind of NDA.  He doesn't have access to some deep information that some of you think he does.  90% of his work is mediocre at best and doesn't reflect the skill most professionals have in their portfolio after the same amount of time he's been at this. Big reason why you're not seeing him do more ""official content for studios"". All he's doing and continues to do is fan art. Bring mentioned by celebrities here and there doesn't mean he knows people in the ""industry"". If he did, he would be much further ahead than he is.",0

">I've been the odd man out before and yeah it's not fun  Im sorry to hear that, but it's basically what my points are about, if different demographics are represented more often and more widely, overtime societal consciousness shifts and less and less people feel like they're the odd man out on a subconscious level. People feel more comfortable with who they are.   >I have had a learning disability but that doesnt make me feel better when I see people with other disabilities represented in shows or movies.   It might not for you, but it has helped a lot of people. It's not even just about making individuals feel more comfortable with themselves, it's about making other people more aware. This has had a huge impact in disabled communities.   But to be honest man, my points seem to mostly be going over your head, so I'm just going to leave it here.   All I ask is that you actually read up on how representation effects people and how it helps them.",1
He likely doesn't fear conflict.     He potentially fears conflict with a certified psychopath who murdered the sidekick of the other dude everyone in town is afraid of.,3
His suits are on point,3
There aren't constant posts about Pattinson though,1
I never thought about it that way. These movies just keep giving new layers.,3

How are you even sure about this? Just because some article you found in the internet said so?  There's no real truth to this. People are just jumping to conclusions.,1

"Hell yeah, if JJ Abrams has a grand scheme to maybe get Superman back on screen or introduce Hal as Green Lanter and do that movie. Hopefully jj enjoys Snyder’s vision and could possibly just continue it? As long as he is going to fucking deliver man. It kind of hinges on Rise of Skywalker I feel like.",3

"Yeah I think Cage could have. No one thought Keaton could have either but the take was strong enough it worked. I think between Burton and Cage and the writer they’d have come up with something compelling. Cage is also a really great actor when he’s on, especially at that time.   I didn’t read the script but if they played Cage as a Clark who really struggled to be the kind of normal and invisible that Reeves one was, there’s something fitting and dramatic in that.",3
But who is really taking about Shazam right now after its success? No one. They even said they fast tracked a sequel to keep the kids young.,0

:D He also replied with a smiley face to someone say “Fuck Variety”. Someone maybe called Toby Emmerich trying to bury the truth?,1
"I know it seems to be an unpopular opinion, maybe because of his previous Superman script, but I think JJ would do an amazing job with Superman. He's my first choice if it were up to me. He's been killing it lately with capturing the spirit of these older franchises while refreshing them at the same time.",2
Ok. Saw his name on the byline.,1
This happens when you have a complete vision of your work,3
Who actually believes Variety? 😂,2
Perfect cast,1

"Nah, confused hollywood reporter with Heroic Hollywood, whoops!",2
">It seems like both what the character said and what Zack said line up here.  I dunno. It looks to me like you're forcing it to fit rather than that actually making it to the screen. Superman was restraining Zod rather than Zod simply holding off daring Clark to kill him as your suggesting. If it *was* supposed to be Zod ""pointing a gun"" at the family forcing Clark to make a choice then that didn't come across in the execution at all. If it did we wouldn't be having this conversation.",0

Willem Dafoe creates Twitter account only to say #ReleaseTheSnyderCut,2
The fact that shows like Fleabag and Barry were aired and received incredibly well this year proves  that woke culture isn’t the death of comedy. It just means you have to try a bit harder than just dick jokes.,3
#ReleaseTheSnyderCut  So much character development cut out...,1
"Not to offend anyone, but I thought Aquaman sucked. Especially compared to others on that list. The costumes, the acting all felt childish and power ranger-y to me.   Never knew it made a billion dollars.",1
Yeah. Like in the first Guardians there’s a blink and you miss it detail that Quill has a translator implant.,3
Some pretty big coincidences today.,2
The Green Hornet Waltz.,1
could be cool. or fassbender maybe.,1
"God, still the best superman film to date. Wish Zack stuck around for a man if steel trilogy rather than touch man of steel",1
My Pick would be  Deborah Ayorinde she is a perfect for the role. Plus she is beautiful and is on the come as an actress and has gone on the record saying she would love to play a superhero role.,2
"This bit is my personal speculation, but they knew DC fans were tuning into the WB keynote presentation since a lot of fans were tweeting the link to the broadcast meeting when it was about to stream (I tuned in live), and advocates of #ReleaseTheSnyderCut have been doing letter-writing campaigns and calls for a long time, so I feel it was a topic they were subtly hinting at without outright commenting on it for whatever their reasons are. ",0
Maybe Gadot had to do her work earlier because of her busy Wonder Woman schedule. There’s no way a movie like JL was in the final stages of post-production 10 months before release.,0
"Okay, let's say that they name the source as John Doe. What's gonna happen is that John gets fired from WB for leaking stuff to journalists before the studio is ready to talk about it officially. After John gets fired, the journalist will not get any info from his/her other sources at any studio because all of them have seen what happened with John.  Do you still think it's a good idea to name your sources in the article?",2
"You don't man. If you did, you wouldn't be saying any of what you did about the boxoffice of the film. You clearly don't understand that BvS had terrible legs and should have made a billion with it's opening weekend. And you still haven't given me a single source.",1
This makes up for him lying to the fans at comic con.,1
The uk shares a language with America and lots of pop culture. Very different for someone from Southern Africa or South East Asia for example.,1
It took me awhile but he did grow on me as Darkseid and I think he's a good choice.,1
I concur,3
Oh. I didn't know that. I think they could have forced the studio to put 'Alan Smithee'  on all the materials JL related including TV release and home sales.,1
Oh okay. That's a pretty good opinnion on MoS.,0
Steppenwolf is so distractingly god awful looking that I’m convinced the rotten tomato score would go up by 10 to 15 percent. Still other issues but it would be so much more enjoyable if it wasn’t SO GOD DAMN FUCK UGLY BAD! It enrages me how bad he looks in that movie,1
"With Lightray, you need a guy who can act very cheerful, a literally ray of sunshine that bounced off of Orion’s more grounded and dour outlook on life. I can kind of see Kebbell doing this but honestly, I can see him working better as Orion",2

"I see your Christoph Waltz Mr. Freeze, and I raise you Christoph Waltz Dr. Doom 🤓😎",1
"Casting Luthor should be more about his personality.

Exactly. I didn't love bvs but fk me firemen save cats from trees too I don't need to see Cavill do this lmao grow the hell up,1
I can't believe that I will never get to see Ben Affleck's Batman going up against Joe Manganiello's Deathstroke 😓,3
I've said it before and I'll say it again. That flash suit would be so much better without the wires going around it.,1
"see ya, because snyder is most definitely never coming back",2
Daniel Day Lewis would make a great scarecrow,1
He deserves his own Deathstroke movie! Look at that suit it’s too good to be wasted!,3

">It was like WB wanted so badly to be marvel that they just straight up hired Whedon assuming he was the key to their success  I get the feeling that was exactly their thoughts, and the whole hiring him for Batgirl was just a cover.",1
Javier as Darkseid tho,2
"""It's not finished"" yea okayyyyy",3
I'm willing to believe that he is incredibly good at hiding those things and others. to a point that would be impossible in real life. But I also think that Lex Luthor is also supernaturally smart in a way that he could find out who Batman was.,1
Eh he looks cool but I'm fine this isn't in the film  Vulko feels a bit unnecessary within the story the film seems to be telling,1
Where is that even HINTED to in these movies?,1
"Nah it wouldn’t. Cool designs won’t last, only development and story will. Plus, he’s a typical big grey ugly villain, doomsday and ares were like that and how many people remember them?  Memorable would be someone with good lines, backstory. Someone like Sivana.  Unfortunately, human looking faces and body are the way to go, because it makes them relatable. Like Thanos.",0
I hope that Johnson has taken some acting classes for this movie.,0
HAAAAARK,3
What are we...some type of Birds of Prey squad?,2
"Wasn't referring to scoops. I was referring to the topic, which in this case is the interview.",1
"I'm wholly unenthused, also. And here's the kicker: I love Harley. I was excited for her follow up project. But between the nonsensical mix of HQ with the Birds of Prey (a team I love from the comics); the fact that they appear to be pulling from comic runs I personally didn't care for (Harley's solo series, Canary's 'I'm a rockstar/crime fighter' series); the lacklustre (being generous) and unrecognisable ""costume"" design; what they've done to Cassandra (my favourite Batgirl); what they've done with Black Mask and the rumoured plot with the whole USB diamond thing... It's all adding up to 'Nope' for *moi*.  Roll on **The Suicide Squad**.",3
"But they cut most of the Atlanteans scenes making Wan having the posibility of doing his own thing, in this version Vulko is super different from the Aquaman movie (by far better in Aquaman, here he looks like a generic medieval noble guy),",1
"Love this design, he looks damn scary!",2
"The complaints about McGregor not having his mask for the majority of the movie don't make sense to me. Why can't the movie show his transformation from Roman Sionis into Black Mask? Especially if it completes his character arc in the film itself. Not to mention, him eventually wearing the mask would be a great event in the second or third act of the film.   On top of that, plenty of comic book film's villans have origin stories for the character, where they become the full fledged or final form of the character in the 2nd or 3rd act. And for Black Mask, that actually makes even more sense.",3
"I hope with all these other indirect hints like following ZS, liking RTSC posts etc, we're heading in the right direction.",1
Isn’t dead water in dc Metal?,1
This looks a hell of a lot better.,1
"I can agree with this, the costumes and sets are absolutely amazing.  But the dc method just isn't my style, I'm not going to say anything negative but they're polar opposite of the way marvel handles their movies and i enjoy the marvel ones.",2
The only poor part of BvS is the doomsday design and how he came into being. People complain about the Martha line but it made sense to me,3
Looking forward to the snyder cut to see what he would've looked like. Although I doubt the glimpse of him is a lot.,1
I'd replace him with Timothee Chalamet,0
Ugh... Michael B Jordan as Superman...,2
I heard there are multiple smaller “S”s put all around the suit. Such creativity!,3
"I didn't say they were the only ones, I said they were a good chunk as well as GA members. That a because the people that had been following the series wanted to see more of these characters AS WELL AS the new fans they were pulling in.",0
If she’s finished her WW trilogy then sure.,3
Clue. Get some.,1
Truly you represent your nickname haha,1
"It's both, reason being is it's certainly a sequel or atleast a continuation of MoS. But half of it is told from the perspective of Batman. It's neither more so of someone's film or not. Yet the story does follow on from MoS with Superman having the core elements to the narrative progression. i.e. Lex and Doomsday, which batman has none of other than Superman himself.  Edit: I suspect Cavill is less in favour of it now since being brainwashed by Whedon and Johns.",1
WB probably thought Snyder's Steppenwolf looked too similar to Doomsday and might confuse viewers.,3
Just do the Lex origin please,3
"The reshoot joke I find little issue with is “Sorry guys, I didn’t bring a sword.” I think *that* one fits with the same humor as “I hear you talk to fish” (the first time when he meets Aquaman. Not the second time in the Batcave). The reason I dislike it is because it was so unnecessarily reshot. It was one line. It replaced “My turn...” which, I think was an awesome line. So while it works, I think it was an unnecessary reshoot. It didn’t change anything in the movie except what’s said in those 3 seconds.",2
So the latter than. Cool,1
>Zack Snyder hasnt confirmed anything and nothing he said has been picked up.   Stopped reading there.  Literally nothing you said was even on the same planet as the truth.

They either say it doesn’t exist or it’s not finished. Folks would rather believe sites like Collider who have decided to hop on the Snyder Cut bandwagon now.,2
Dean Cain had a nice “S” lol....,2
Thnx for the explanation. As far as I know DnD were the total and complete showrunners,2
Did he tell you that personally?,0
