Imagine how beautiful this is in colors.,3
Them cape points are on point!,3
Now there‚Äôs a Batman,3
"Say whatever you want, Snyder knows how to film some gorgeous shots.",3
God that man has a gift for shooting some amazing stuff,3
Today was like a pre-Christmas. I dig those bat-goggles too. They just make so much sense!,3
It's so awkward that the bat-googles was preserved on almost all Batman JL merchandise and they CGIed-it off of the movie just because  They haven't either cared about brand coherency when decided to butcher it all,3
"At this point I'm starting to think he just looks at his cut of the film, on repeat, daily.    Can't say that I blame him. No matter what it has to be better than the final product we were all force fed by WB",2
stop stop I‚Äôm already erect!,3
My favorite Batman.,3
"So do we Zack, so do we..",3
Yep. I need more of this. Much more of this!,3
If they were gonna cover his eyes why not just give him white eyes at that point?,2
Now THAT'S Batman.,3
I‚Äôm a fan of the BvS suits but man that tactical suit was so over designed with some of the plates in the ab area,3
Oof can‚Äôt agree with Zack on the goggles,2
"Just sucks that after this he really wouldn't of had much to do. Everything would've been WW, AM, Cyborg and Superman against Stephenwolf. I wonder what Batman would've been up to on screen. Or just another Doomsday fight situation",1
I don't like the goggles,1
Isn‚Äôt this shot already in the movie? Also what if Snyder cut turns out just like BvS?,1
"If/When they do release it, there needs to be a B/W version. Heck, there needs to be a B/W version of MoS and BvS.",1
"Joss must really hate Batman, one. He put a plastic cover over that epic shot, two. This shot is misplaced in the film where he jumps inside the tunnel, Three. That fuck old theme. Four. God awful dialogues.",1
Damn it I wanna know if Snyder's ending will have red sky eventually or just blue the whole time.,1
"So, people are saying they cgi‚Äôd the goggles out for the theatrical cut. Can anyone refresh my memory on what scenes they did that?",1
"‚ÄúGorgeous shot?‚Äù Christ, it looks like Burton‚Äôs Batman.",1
so how exactly IS he making the cape spread out like that without holding on to it?,0
Crazy thought but what if the Snyder cut is actually in black and white like all these pics he‚Äôs been posting?,0
Besides the killing stuff and what not this Batman is too cartoony for my liking.,0
This shot is in the movie. Here it is in color: [https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bd/62/c5/bd62c5b2684001903446d9df0ddb9027.gif](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bd/62/c5/bd62c5b2684001903446d9df0ddb9027.gif),3
And they LITERALLY have points.,3
"Sucker Punch is a good example of that Terrible movie, but that guy can create some amazing imagery.",3
"He‚Äôs always been great at that but unfortunately that doesn‚Äôt translate to a good movie. Snyder is all style, no substance. He doesn‚Äôt direct character and performance well. He‚Äôs also bad at constructing stories.",3
The opening scene of Watchmen always gets me,1
in all 3 movies,0
"The latter was likely a Whedon call and they couldn't recall the merch without spending millions an rushing a ""fixed"" version.",2
"I mean, that‚Äôs possible but he could also just have an album of favorite shots from the cut that he chooses to post from, instead of actually going through the movie every single time.",2
The Best Batman.,3
"For real.  I thought the goggles looked stupid, and his cowl didn‚Äôt look right either.  It reminded me of Night Owl from the Watchmen movie, should have just stuck with the Batman v Superman suit.... also, not sure if it was Whedon or Snyder‚Äôs call, but Superman‚Äôs suit in Justice League looked like ass too.  It looked like a Joel Schumacher version of a Zach Snyder idea of what the suit should look like.",2
yea I wasn't a big fan of the tactical suit,2
Agreed. Reminded me too much of Schumacher.,1
And Nolan's wasn't??. Wow,0
"From what I gathered, kinda. He takes on this suicide mission to lure the parademons away, he takes over one of their turrets and starts blasting them to make an opening for the rest to go after steppenwolf.",1
>what if Snyder cut turns out just like BvS   How exactly ?,2
"Not everyone hates BvS. All the complaints people throw at it over the storytelling, or the tone, or the characterization, some of us absolutely love it for those reasons and see those flaws in other superhero films instead. If you didn't like the Snyder films, you probably won't like the Snyder Cut. If you did like his films, it's reasonable to think you'll like his cut of JL better than the studio version.",1
"Turn the saturation down on your TV, contrast up. You're welcome.",3
"It‚Äôs Batman, I‚Äôm sure he has some fabric thin mechanical inlays, or like nolanverse Batman it was done with electrical current.",1
Are you talking about Ben‚Äôs Batman overall or Whedon‚Äôs for Justice League?,2
Isn‚Äôt that a trailer? I thought the movie CGI‚Äôd that structure behind him.  Link:   [comparison of two. ](https://twitter.com/dc_connections/status/1199495007792709634?s=21),3
This is in the trailer right?   In the movie they CGI‚Äôd the glasses off.,3
"Yes. But in the movie, it's touched with CGI pillars behind Batman and I can't see shit",3
With that ugly red sky and color grading üôÑü§Æ,3
No no no. It‚Äôs in the movie butchered and in the wrong ugly red background.,3
The true colors,1
Looks like a video game,1
"That's a trailer Chris, and it was an edit for the final that was used in the movie.  Whedon ruined that shot.",0
There's a significant amount of people who will swear he's god's gift to film making lol.,2
His theatrical cuts are typically stunted. But he did an amazing Dawn Of The Dead and 300. Watchmen is fantastic in any cut.,3
"I'm sure he remembers cinematic moments and has them filed. That seems like something normal for a director to do. But you, jokes...",1
"Why would it be a Snyder ‚Äôs  call? There is barely any Snyder Superman footage in the movie and the little there is has the colors changed to what it was supposed to look like, we have no idea how it would look in Justice League.",0
What does Nolan have anything to do with this? Lmao      For the record. Nolan‚Äôs suit isn‚Äôt that great either. Well the Batman Begins ones is good. The others have too much plating too. Sheesh.,3
Fantastic but misunderstood by some?,2
"Poorly narrated, lackluster final act, joyless and visually too dark? I know people wanna see it, but I simply afraid it may not live up to the expectation.  But fuck, I would rather watch that 100 times then watch Justice League one more fucking time, I swear the god I will craw my eyes out and I‚Äôm not even joking.",1
Boom. Easy peasy.,1
Well yes definitely JL Batman. But even some of the stuff in BvS. I know that‚Äôs how Batman is in the comics and I thought that was what I wanted but after BvS I realized I didn‚Äôt want Batman facing giant cgi monsters or fighting against Superman or fighting against parademons etc. Just my preference but I prefer a more grounded take when it comes to live action Batman.,1
Wow. That looks hideous,3
"Honestly more likely that the glasses were CGI in the first place, so they just removed it.",2
The shot wasn't good to begin with.,1
he's God's gift to film making.,1
Those people should be put to death.,1
I didnt mean like his movies my bad. Watchmen was great but his justice league story was ehh,0
"Preach it. Nothing screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a mysterious entity of the night, just a dude in a fancy suit of armor‚Äù more than wearing a suit of armor.",1
"Because there is constant nit picky 'criticisms' that is actually just sheer hypocrisy.   Seeing as this is a subject of batman, it's very relevant LmAo!*?¬£&@",0
"I believe it's going to be a pretty straightforward movie just like the theatrical cut but with more character development , better visuals & better structured plot",2
A bloated mess where Snyder throws away tons of comic material for his own entertainment.  Remember when Superman's best friend had 3 lines then got shot in the head in the fucking desert?,1
I don't think it would be anywhere near what people expect and most of his fans will bend over backwards to justify their enjoyment of it.,2
That warehouse seen tho that‚Äôs what I wanna see more of .,1
I completely get that but that‚Äôs pretty much all we‚Äôve gotten so far. I like seeing him fight alongside Superman and Wonder Woman. I loved Nolan‚Äôs realistic take on the character but loved that this was something different.,1
both do. It‚Äôs a bad CGI shot.,1
there's picture of him wearing them as Bruce and Batman,2
Bit much lol,1
He is talking about visuals and shots. Snyder knows how to tell a story with visuals.,1
Nolan's being over designed doesn't take away from the fact that this one is too is the point. Nolan's has nothing to do with this.,1
Snyder has never put compelling character development on screen,1
"I mean, it‚Äôs their rights, and even if it‚Äôs a messy it would be a mess that they asked for and what Snyder would have wanted. JL on the other hand is an abomination, a Frankenstein‚Äôs monster that nobody asked for, like doomsday.",1
Those are the same flaws Zack has with all his movies.   He wasn't gonna suddenly become a great filmmaker. All he can do well are visuals.,1
Except for the murder,1
"I think there can be balance. I really think you can have a Batman movie with some fantastical elements (even though the dark knight trilogy was touted as this ultra realistic take, Batman begins had a lot of fantasy elements to it) without having him fight against monsters etc.",1
It might be hard to see through them and maybe it‚Äôs uncomfortable during some move-y parts of shooting.,0
Oh yea visuals are good,1
"How does it not - it's fucking batman that you're all talking about. Have an actual opinion will you, when someone calls you out on bias/hypocrisy you can give a valid answer, instead of trying to completely dismiss it.",0
"Oddly enough, as flawed as JL was, it was an enjoyable movie for me and the one of the few DCEU movies I can watch from beginning to end and remain entertained all through.   My biggest gripe with the whole affair was WB's decision to use Snyder to kickstart the DCEU. When I say this, it usually looks like i'm Anti-Snyder but I'm not. I enjoyed 300 immensely and Sucker Punch is still one of my fav films to watch.   BUT  Story is not the man's strength. It's in set pieces. He would have been a great choice for Batman movies or noir characters within the DCEU. But using his style for the whole universe is what has got us to the point we're currently in. In my humble opinion",1
I agree with that and we‚Äôve seen that for about seven movies. I‚Äôd like there to be a variety of both which is what I‚Äôve loved about BvS.,1
"Because trying to defend the over designed suit by saying that someone else made an overdesigned suit it stupid. It's like saying ""this Batman film is bad but it's okay because someone has made a bad Batman film before"". The idea is to do better.",1
Yes that‚Äôs cool. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.,1
"Your definition by 'by to do better' is limited if you are referring to its ab plates, that you may personally dislike. When literally most of the suits, if that - all of them have this.",0
My issue is more with your logic. Like someone doing something bad isn't an excuse for other people to do it.,1
"Depends what you mean by bad, because this is subjective, not a mass murder spree. The fact that something is being criticised and feelings towards that thing are based negatively around a certain trait, yet is done by another, of which one would celebrate or have no problem with otherwise is less logical imo.",0
Can someone explain how you cut Williem Dafoe from you fucking movie??,3
Zack Snyder should just release the movie frame by frame as b&w stills. And then let fans color-grade it as a collaborative fan edit lol  \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
"VULKO WAS IN JUSTICE LEAGUE?! What the actual fuck! I actually didn‚Äôt even know that!   And he looks fucking badass with the armor and the hair down...  Fuck me, RELEASE THE SNYDER CUT FUCKERS  They fucking cut William Defoe. My goodness.",3
"So, is the Snyder cut an entirely different movie or what?",3
" Hark Triton, hark! Bellow, bid our father the Sea King rise from the depths full foul in his fury! Black waves teeming with salt foam to smother this young mouth with pungent slime, to choke ye, engorging your organs til' ye turn blue and bloated with bilge and brine and can scream no more - only when he, crowned in cockle shells with slitherin' tentacle tail and steaming beard take up his fell be-finned arm, his coral-tine trident screeches banshee-like in the tempest and plunges right through yer gullet, bursting ye - a bulging bladder no more, but a blasted bloody film now and nothing for the harpies and the souls of dead sailors to peck and claw and feed upon only to be lapped up and swallowed by the infinite waters of the Dread Emperor himself - forgotten to any man, to any time, forgotten to any god or devil, forgotten even to the sea, for any stuff for part of Winslow, even any scantling of your soul is Winslow no more, but is now itself the sea!",3
"My man Zack had already casted a vast chunk of the DCEU and all he got was ‚Äútoo soon man, why so rushed? Wait at least three movies before new characters jeesh :P‚Äù",3
I offered you friendship and you spat in my face.,3
I feel like Snyder releases some of these photos to clap back at the ‚Äòsources‚Äô claiming WB are calling it a pipe dream and saying it‚Äôs never going to be released.   Maybe just me,3
"LET NEPTUNE STRIKE YE DEAD, WINSLOW.   HARK, TRITON, HARK.",3
‚Äúin the movie‚Äù. These words are intentional in my opinion. Interesting timing with the Variety article out there today ü§î,3
"Ya know, I‚Äôm something of a DC villain myself",3
AAAAA Looks so goooood!!!,3
That is a good look. Damn.,3
MOTHERF---,3
"Please, just release the SnyderCut",3
I definitely like his armor here over the spandex suit he wears in Aquaman..,3
Fuck yeah.  &#x200B;  I think Zack is going to go into overload mode now with Snyder Cut exclusives,3
I'm ready for this movie! Come on WB. It's time to make this right. The movie is epic and you're sitting on it.,2
"Seeing him in this armor is fun, but I definitely prefer the slick-backed look his hair had in Aquaman. Idk, I'm just as upset at the way JL turned out but I think letting Wan/the Aquaman team have their say on the feel and look of Atlanteans was the right move.",2
Lika BOOWSE!!  #ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
Hope Wan turns down the cheese a little and utilise this guy in a much more effective way.,3
"I fear the cut wont see the light of the day because if it was to be released, Zack would keep spoilers under wraps.",1
Dude no way! Ah man Snyder is on a roll!!,2
Would they please stop fucking around and just give us this god damn movie?!,2
OUT AM I!?,1
OUT AM I? YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I SACRIFICED?!,2
"You know, Vulko is still in the JL poster.  They just enlarged one of the background characters standing next to him to block him out, but you can still see a small part of him and his trident.",2
HE LOOKS SO FUCKING COOL,3
Can you imagine a Snyder Aquaman!,3
I loved Aquaman but Vulko looks way better here than in almost all of Aquaman.,2
They did Zack and the entire fanbase dirty with what they released. Dumb execs,2
SON OF A BITCH THIS IS DOPE!,1
He was probably in the same scene with Mera fending off Steppenwolf,1
I hate that the assholes are the ones with the loudest mouths.   Now they are attacking the aquaman movie and James wan for not using bubbles.,1
"#For The Love Of God, ReleaseTheSnyderCut",1
He looks WAY better there than in Aquaman.  Huh.,2
"There is no way they would be dropping all these photos unless it's actually coming, Warner would have shut this down fast if it was zach alone doing this. Also wanna let everyone know im also one of the people who love BvS... Ultimate cut.. It's my favorite of 2016.. You gotta let Snyder complete his work for it to make sense. He proves that with every directors cut.",2
The boss is on fire today.   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
[Mood](https://giphy.com/gifs/angry-mad-anger-l1J9u3TZfpmeDLkD6),2
"OUT, AM I???",1
"I mean, honestly, I didn't care about the Snyder cut, because I figured, ""how much can you really change?"" right? Because the villain was flat, with little to know character whatsoever, the dialogue was clunky, the lighting and cinematography, for the most part, didn't fit the tone, and again, I can't stress how poor of an antagonist Steppenwolf turned out to be. But now it's abundantly clear that Snyder just made a different movie, with a cavalcade of characters who didn't even make it to the screen till Aquaman. I don't know how much better his cut might've been in terms of plot and characters, but it would've been something completely different for sure. Whatever it turned out to be, however good or bad, it deserves to be seen and given a shot. #releasethesnydercut",1
Do you think Zack Snyder is going to release the Snyder cut frame by frame?,1
Okay seriously wtf was up with Justice leagues production. This isn't anything like the movie I saw. I mean cuts are one thing but I don't even know where the fuck all the things were cut from.,1
Just release the goddamn thing WB,1
Eh he looks cool but I'm fine this isn't in the film  Vulko feels a bit unnecessary within the story the film seems to be telling,1
Still confused about what all these still releases mean...,1
Waw what a really good shot and presence,1
"Snyder's Atlantian Design looks so much better than James Wan's. Way more realistic and ""dirty"".",1
Damn you FAT JOSS,1
Fucking Joss Wheadon,0
Willem Dafoe with long hair... hmmmmmmmmmmm no thx,0
Am I happy Wan asked him to remove things. Bullet dodged.,0
Snyder is very good at visuals but it‚Äôs too bad he can‚Äôt tell a good story to save his life. Lindelof‚Äôs Watchmen HBO show makes Snyder‚Äôs film look like amateur hour.,0
Any sources?,0
"I prefer vulko in aquaman, thanks",0
LET NEPTUNE STRIKE YE DEAD WHEDON,3
It's probably the same reason why Warners also removed Darkseid/Uxas from Snyder's JL. I'm guessing Warners don't wanna give anymore DC characters to Snyder. Vulko was shown in Aquaman first and the credit is most likely going to go to James Wan even tho we already know that Dafoe was cast as Vulko in JL first. It's all part of Warners moving away from Snyder's vision.  This is like more reason why Warners won't release the Snyder Cut. JL is just like one big damage control and course correction by Warners.,3
"WB probably need to minimize everything in JL as small and contained as possible in order to prevent conflict with other director ceative idea.  For example Patty/Gal already retcon WW about her abandon humanity, and James Wan drop ""bubble talk"" and ""Mother issue"" entirely.",3
OUT AM I?,3
When you're WB and Whedon,1
He was probably unnecessary. The existing Aquaman scene is pretty out of place as it is,1
Is it not obvious enough? Wan had a wildly different vision for these characters and asked for a blank canvas. He met up with Zack to have that,1
Exactly!!!! The guy is a fucking LEGEND. And yet we don't get to see him work in the final cut.  #releasethesnydercut,1
it seems like 4 movies were cut out of this movie at this point.,1
I remember seeing he and Jared Leto in the original list of actors on IMDb,1
"So he can play the Joker later in that universe, hopefully??",0
Poor planning and therefore poor directing.  It‚Äôs sounding like he shot a 4+ hour movie and it wasn‚Äôt what he as hired to do...that‚Äôs all on him.,0
At this point I'd watch the whole thing in black and white and be happy.,3
That would get him sued,1
Jason: #ReleaseTheSynderCut,1
There was also this one from awhile ago that was supposed to be at the end of the film.  https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/a3odcv/vero_zack_snyder_shares_a_deleted_scene_of_arthur/,3
"If you look at the theatrical poster at this link, you can tell Vulko was in it but they enlarged Mera to block him out. You can still see the back of him behind Mera.  He may also be the one holding that spear.    Also, Mera wearing the same cloak/cape as seen in the photo Snyder posted today. Awesome.   https://www.storenvy.com/products/22327449-justice-league-all-in-2-movie-poster-made-to-order-delivery-included",3
Pretty much. I read somewhere that it has like 60-80 new/different minutes of footage.,3
I‚Äôm still confused about it as well. I wonder how Superman would‚Äôve resurrected.,3
"Pretty much all principal photography was completed and Whedon was brought in during the editing process, so they added a bunch of shit. Steppenwolf was supposed to be far more terrifying and cruel than what we got.",2
Haha fuck yes.  This photo reminds me of the Lighthouse.,3
You really think Snyder posted the pictures by chance? Timing is everything.,3
Have you read the Forbes article?,2
"I also prefer the armored look for Mera, instead of her (albeit more comic-accurate) suit in Aquaman.",3
They look way better in aquaman.,1
"Vulko looks sick in this pic!. I'd eat my own hand if wan done that. But it's not his style, unless he's making a horror, so I know that'll never happen. Which is pretty shit for us.",3
"Rein it in a little, I think Wan and the more colorful, fun approach worked wonders for Aquaman and a Snyder movie would NOT have been as good or worked for the character.",1
I love Snyder‚Äôs aesthetic. I also love Wan but an Aquaman movie from Snyder sounds so good.,2
i dont want a snyder air bubble aquaman,1
"Look, I've liked most of Snyder's ideas and want to see his original movie released, but the bubble domes were...kinda dumb. I get the idea of wanting a twinge of realism, but it's really overthinking things.",1
"Bought it and watched it for the first time last week (I actually liked the theater cut) and even though I knew most of the changes of the ultimate edition, it still did wonders to the movie",1
"Yeah, we looked forward to a JL movie and ended up getting an Avengers movie, so we need to see that Snyder cut ASAP.",1
So Aquaman just randomly going to the Motherbox temple for no reason makes sense to you?,1
What story?,1
i'd take james wan any day,1
"Honestly, whether it's his TV shows, his movies, his comic books or whatever, I've never enjoyed anything Joss Whedon's dipped his hands into. The guy's a hac whose own ex-wife called him out for abusing his producer powers to force actresses into doing the casting couch to get into his shows/films.",1
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong someone but didn‚Äôt joss take this gig so he could make his birds of prey film which isn‚Äôt happening now? Which makes it 100x worse,2
Only asked him to remove King Atlan.,1
"Problem with your statement is that other than changing the ending from a fake alien squid attack to a fake Doctor Manhattan attack, Snyder literally made a panel-by-panel remake of the graphic novel.  So if you have issues with the movie, you have issues with Alan Moore's writing, too.",2
"Uh, Snyder‚Äôs Vero account.",3
He was supposed to be in both.,1
HAAAAAAAAARK,3
It's weird because it feels like they purposely ruined the movie so they could say oh whoops guess we should move in a new direction but all they did was make Snyder a martyr and piss everyone off.,3
Do you think the snyder cut will be released?,2
thank you for saying this,1
A hint for you: Ben and Gal would have never come out the way they did is there weren‚Äôt negotiations and guarantees in place. It is coming out.,1
Yeah I think people lowball the continuity issues would still be there in these films.,2
">What the fuck did Joss do to this film?  I agree that the film was wronged by the studio, but I don't think blaming Joss is helpful. He was hired to come in and change the film, and was probably pushed to make it more *Avengers*\-like. Higher-ups are to blame here, not the director who listened to them.",3
The only poor part of BvS is the doomsday design and how he came into being. People complain about the Martha line but it made sense to me,3
Technically Whedon is the cuckoo.,1
"You and me both, my guy..or gal. I think there‚Äôs a lot more fans than you think, that would love to see Snyder‚Äôs vision for JL.",2
>instead of some cuckold  How epic bro,1
"Explanation? Try imagining you had to shorten and change a two parts movie with possibily longer than 5 hours into one movie, even worse it was limited at 2 hours only. And you have only few months to do it.",0
Only thing Zack changed for Wan was removing the dead King Atlan from Justice League. This scene wasn‚Äôt an issue for Wan.,2
After watching Watchmen episode 6 I'm all for that. There's somehting about B&W that just makes you focus on the actors performance and it can be so cinematographic.,3
The DCEU is so dark that it‚Äôs already B&W. /s,3
Omg that's wild,1
holy shit...,1
"Bottom line: consider the theatrical cut is 120 minutes in length.  35 minutes of that is apparently what Zack created and intended to be in the film.  His original cut of the finished movie was said to be around 215 minutes(!!!) in length.  We're talking nearly three entire hours of movie that got cut, edited, or thrown on the shelf.   Drives you crazy, doesn't it?",3
"If they went by the comic, he never really died. Just went into hibernation while his body repaired itself. Coincidentally, the older he gets, the less vulnerable he becomes. My take is maybe Green Lantern shows up and brings his body back to space to absorb unfiltered energy from the sun. If not, then who knows. The dirt on his casket floated at the end of BvS so like I said, I don't think he's dead anyways.  What is crazy to imagine is if they didn't remove Zod's head, he may have regenerated, too.",3
I'm pretty sure the codes being infused in Superman would have played a key role in it,1
Isn't that part in the SC though?,1
also the only person in the world using vero. probably getting paid big to do that.,1
"I have. I really enjoy Hughes‚Äô breakdown of things. Very detailed. It‚Äôs crazy how much has happened today between his article, Variety, and then Zack posting all these photos.",3
Anybody got the sparknotes for both of those articles? Lol,1
"Yeah, Vulko looks like a badass in this scene. Like he‚Äôs seen some serious shit.",3
Lets be honest Wan wasted him. I hope sequel has a much more focused plot and gives more time for each character to flesh out. (Mera Vulko Manta can certainly use more screentime),2
"I agree. I‚Äôm a fan of the dceu, but I‚Äôm no fan of air bubbles.",1
"I mean, not even that. At least with Joss Whedon's Avengers movie, the characters and universe matched the tone of the film. Everything looked and felt like it was meant to be that way, all the way down to Cap's campy ass uniform. But with this everything felt so out of place. I mean, especially going from really darkly lit shots to that fucking closeup of Aquaman, which I swear belongs in a Colgate commercial.  And at least Whedon's Avengers had a villain with some discernible character. My god, I hated Steppenwolf in this. It was like WB wanted so badly to be marvel that they just straight up hired Whedon assuming he was the key to their success",1
"Firstly wasn't there a scene where he hears some shit's going down there, like wasn't the point of that bar scenes?  Secondly do you think Vulko would not tell Arthur about this place in the decades he's trained him?  Again it comes back to an issue I had with BVS and I'll probably have with the Snyder Cut when it releases. Putting shit in the movie is fun but If it has no reason to be there don't use it   Vulko would be little more then fanservice/buildup for Aquaman that would be contradicted anyway",1
Not sure if this is sarcasm,1
More than likely. Even though BOP will now be shit. Harley doesnt need to be in it. Either way. As much as I love DC and the fact they're making films. It's dead in the water.,1
"When he first signed on, he was supposed to be given Batgirl, but I think that was just for PR, too.",1
Kay,0
I keep seeing that as a source and I just don‚Äôt think it counts.,0
I came to this thread for this exact exchange.,3
Alright I liked the lobster,3
How long have we been on this rok?,2
Precisely this. Fuck em.,3
"I truly believe it was purposeful. But for more complex, political reasons. I think it plays into the AT&T-Warner merger. WB had to curry favor to the FCC because Trump, Under the influence of Murdoch (FOX), was fighting to stop it from happening. Using the power of his administration to do so. Disney also needed to fight the merger and also protect their Marvel franchise, while also doing a favor for FOX. In some way it all comes together. The idiots at WB didn‚Äôt realize or didn‚Äôt care that the idiots at Disney had the left ear of the idiots at FOX, who had the left ear of the idiots at the White House. Shrine, Murdoch and others saw an opportunity to win in several ways. The #Metoo movement was gutting the hierarchy of FOX and it was beneficial to smear others to distort the message and distract from the big players. I truly think Ben was targeted to achieve this. Meanwhile Disney is threatened by the JL movie for its obvious parallel in the story for the grand finale of their decade long Marvel campaign. If JL had realized Snyder‚Äôs vision, it would have surely dented the final numbers and acclaim received by Infinity War/Endgame-audiences would have no doubt been underwhelmed by the obvious repeat of so many plot points they would have already seen in JL. People need to realize how ruthless Disney is in competition and that just because they tweet nice things (which I regard as mocking) doesn‚Äôt mean they give two shits about WB‚Äôs BO achievements. Corporate sabotage is a real thing and fans have been played hard, especially in this very sub. In some way I can‚Äôt wholly piece together WB managed to allow Disney and Whedon to royally fuck up their movie, so they could gain favor for their AT&T merger, while simultaneously hurting the BO numbers, permanently damaging the DCCEU, and also destroying the reputation of an actor in one of the most coveted roles in Hollywood. In the end the AT&T merger happened-but so did the Disney/FOX merger, which was completely fucked and should not have happened. FOX assets should have been broken up. The biggest winner of all was Murdoch and co, who pocketed untold sums of cash that would guarantee his assets survive beyond the Trump presidency and the fall of FOX News, which is inevitable as the older generations die off.  [Check out this article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house)  Most notably these parts:  > Telecommunications is a highly regulated industry, and **under Trump the government has consistently furthered Murdoch‚Äôs business interests, to the detriment of his rivals.** Hundt, the former F.C.C. chairman, told me that ‚Äúthere have been three moves that have taken place in the regulatory and antitrust world‚Äù involving telecommunications ‚Äúthat are **extremely unusual, and the only way to explain them is that they‚Äôre pro-Fox, pro-Fox, and pro-Fox.‚Äù**  > Last June, after only **six months** of deliberation, **the Trump Administration approved Fox‚Äôs bid to sell most of its entertainment assets to Disney, for seventy-one billion dollars.** The Murdoch family will receive more than **two billion dollars in the deal, and will become a major stockholder in the combined company.** The Justice Department expressed no serious antitrust concerns, even though the combined company will reportedly **account for half the box-office revenue in America.** Trump publicly congratulated Murdoch even before the Justice Department signed off on the deal, and claimed that it would create jobs. In fact, the consolidation is projected to result in thousands of layoffs.  > **The Justice Department, meanwhile, went to court in an effort to stop A. T. & T.‚Äôs acquisition of Time Warner, which owns CNN.** Time Warner saw the deal as **essential to its survival** at a time when the media business is increasingly dominated by giant competitors such as Google and Facebook. Murdoch understood this impulse: **in 2014, 21st Century Fox had tried, unsuccessfully, to buy Time Warner.** For him, opposing his rivals‚Äô deal was a matter of shrewd business. Trump also opposed the deal, but many people suspected that his objection was a matter of petty retaliation against CNN. Although Presidents have traditionally avoided expressing opinions about legal matters pending before the judicial branch, Trump has bluntly criticized the plan. The day after the Justice Department filed suit to stop it, he declared the proposed merger ‚Äúnot good for the country.‚Äù   > Trump Administration officials say that political considerations did not guide the government‚Äôs actions on the three deals. Blair Levin, the former F.C.C. official, told me, ‚ÄúThere may be innocent explanations.‚Äù But, he adds, ‚Äú**Trump famously said you‚Äôre going to get sick and tired of winning, and that may not be true for the rest of America, but it sure is true of Murdoch.‚Äù** He says of Murdoch, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an incredibly cunning political player. **He leaves no fingerprints**. He‚Äôs been in the game of influencing government behavior to his benefit longer than most of us have been alive.‚Äù   These movies may seem like harmless comic book adaptations that are a fun way to spend a few hours, but besides that they are *big* business. The difference between a successful and failed big budget film is the difference between the continuing success and profit of a movie studio and all those roped into it. Murdoch and co are truly gifted in their insight to how media influences  the average american. They are the puppet masters and the know exactly how to create a perfect storm to upend their rivals. The bottom line is, something dirty went down between WB, Disney, FOX and the Fed. And the DC community and the artists dedicated to it lost big time.",3
I was of the impression it was never actually completed.,0
"Yeah...that's true...I'm sure WB was involved in trying to make it more like Avengers, which DC isn't and surprisingly led to a lackluster film.",2
"yeah, I can't argue that at all...definitely wasn't a big fan of the way they did Doomsday (Krypton did him MUCH better IMO).  The Martha thing was cheesy, sure, but I also felt it was a great scene that made Bruce humanize Clark and realize he was stepping way over the line.  Definitely wasn't as ridiculous as most people make it out to be.",3
"> The only poor part of BvS is the doomsday design   in your opinion yes, in mine there i alot of poor parts",1
"So you were perfectly okay with arguably the most important Superman story arc of his entire legacy, The Death of Superman, being used as a 20 minute throwaway scene in a movie titled BATMAN VS SUPERMAN? Which also happened to be only the 2nd appearance of Superman in the DCEU? Snyder made a desperate attempt to play catch up to Marvel by jamming 10lbs of shit into a 5lb bag.  &#x200B;   He tried in two films, to achieve what marvel did in 7 films. Not to mention the completely unnecessary addition of Wonder Woman and the endless, in your face big budget Justice League advertisement throughout the entire damn film.",1
"Agree with the design, but I'd make one other change: Lex should have had a bigger participation on his inception, gathering Kryptonian technology but ultimately making it by himself. It could even work as premise for another Superman enemy (Bizarro, anyone? A clone one wrong sort of story)",0
"Yeah, I'm honestly pretty surprised that the whole Release the Snyder Cut thing is still going strong and even gaining more and more support from celebrities...maybe one day we'll actually get to see it!",2
"""Cuckold: ...the term is also applied to males who are unwittingly investing parental effort in offspring that are not genetically their own.""  If Justice League were that offspring and it's ""genetic parent"" is Snyder, its actually a pretty accurate description IMO :P  Though Joss wasn't ""unwitting"", I'll concede that hehe",1
"Imagine being in that situation and then instead of using the original director's footage, reshooting 3/4 of the movie from your previous experience in a similar field but  with a completely different aesthetic, ruining it, and delivering an entirely different end result.",0
Doesn't look anything in line with his movie. You believe what you want to tho.,1
I'm behind on Watchmen but watching that episode tonight!  I did see the Lighthouse though and I think you're right. Less coloring distraction lead me to just focus on the actor's faces. Also personally I think cgi is much more convincing in B&W. Not that movies by Snyder have had bad cgi but the parademons would look terrifying in that style.,3
fuck me what a powerful episode,1
Too dark where's muh bright and cheery Superman!,2
Holy shit! My mind is blown.,3
It's kinda depressing seeing how it's basically completely different and we'll probably never get to see it.,2
"they normally film these DC movies 18 months in advance...then they did reshoots 6 months before the release...and basically reshot a whole movie. also the movie is 119 minutes in length. im being pedantic but it was Warner who insisted that the movie be less that 120 minutes, in the belief that more showings could be crammed in if you could get it under 120 minutes.",1
On the closed captions it also reads faint heart beating or something like that,1
Oh absolutely. I‚Äôm loving it,2
"Basically, the Variety article was a round-up of all the rumors both present and past with most of the DC movies going on right now, but the big thing that riled people up was it said that the Snyder Cut is basically a dream, would cost too much, and would never happen.  The Forbes article is from a writer who had previously questioned the validity of the Snyder Cut being thing but after being shown stuff by a credible source (probably Jay Olivia) is convinced it's a thing and basically says anyone who says otherwise is irrationally not looking at the facts and/or has an agenda.",1
He didn‚Äôt waste him. He pretty much played the Obi wan part from new hope.,3
"I'm not disagreeing with you here. I'm saying it's shit how wan utilised him. He had the chessiest of lines out of the entire movie, and I doubt wans character and story telling on screen because if it's not a horror it's not that great. Remember he done fast and furious 7?. That was hot garbage! The best bit about the movie was the ending, not anymore bitter than I am. But that has one of the most emotional endings to movie of the past decade.",1
What Wan did was a spectacle but I feel Snyder would do something a lot more lord of the rings-ish. It would be amazing.,3
">It was like WB wanted so badly to be marvel that they just straight up hired Whedon assuming he was the key to their success  I get the feeling that was exactly their thoughts, and the whole hiring him for Batgirl was just a cover.",1
"He just randomly comes across a body of an Atlantean Steppenwolf killed, for no reason. Pretty sure in Snyder‚Äôs version Vulko tells him the box has been activated.  If you love deus ex machina it‚Äôs fine but most people like the plots to unravel logically.  Wan‚Äôs film doesn‚Äôt contradict Snyder‚Äôs JL and in fact was filmed with Snyder‚Äôs version in mind..They didn‚Äôt alter Aquaman‚Äôs script to fit Whedon‚Äôs version, thankfully.",1
BoP will be shit? It looks awesome to me,1
"I mean, it‚Äôs the movie he directed and he‚Äôs the one that personally released it. If that‚Äôs not good enough for you then that‚Äôs your issue. The dude released it himself, he‚Äôs the source.",3
So the director of the movie isn‚Äôt a valid source?,2
lol are you serious? he is the fucking source,2
"corporation spyonage also is a big thing, also disney meddled with Dark Phoenix...",1
"Yeah for something that has a fraction of the budget, krypton definately did a good job of doomsday",3
"My friend pointed out to me that it was because, at the time, Clark didn't know Bruce knew who he was. So he wouldn't say Mom, he'd say Martha.",2
"Honestly I think the issue with Martha is the way they decided to film it.  Like, in my opinion the idea is really good but the execution was pretty stupid.  It‚Äôs just brutal fighting, brutal fighting, Martha, ptsd flashback, Lois lane comes out of nowhere, and now we‚Äôre friends.  It‚Äôs such a pivotal moment in the movie and it happens so quickly and with so little context.  Imagine if you had to pee right after Batman descends into that lower floor before the Martha scene.  You could literally have been gone two minutes and if you asked me what you missed I would‚Äôve said ‚ÄúBatman was about to kill Superman but Lois Lane told Batman Superman‚Äôs moms name is Martha.‚Äù  And I know Snyder tried to make it as clear as possible that his Batman was basically nuts with all the visions and stuff, but the audience just isn‚Äôt really familiar enough with that kind of Batman to just *do that*.  There would need to be context to that kind of descent.  It‚Äôs the same reason killing didn‚Äôt work for the audience.  No ones saying Batman can‚Äôt kill, but *why* is this Batman killing?  It would be like if they made a Red Son movie and just jumped right into Russian Superman while skipping all the backstory.  Yes, Superman has been Russian before, no one is disputing that, but why is *this* Superman Russian?",2
"Idk butg to me, BVS's version of Doomsday makes more sense to me than Doomsday suddenly appearing to earth randomly.",1
"I mean, wasn‚Äôt stating it as a fact, so you didn‚Äôt really need to say ‚Äúin your opinion yes‚Äù because I never presented it as a fact",2
Drop the salt rock my dude,1
"Wonder Woman was an amazing addition to the movie and was pretty awesome in every scene she was in. The mystery at the party, the playful banter with Bruce at the sword of Alexander, and her entrance and fighting against doomsday all went well The only JL advertisement in the film was the QuickTime videos and that honestly feels like a studio guided decision Also I don't understand why killing him in the second movie is inherently a problem. It gives actual stakes to the movie and presents real danger to the situations they're placed in. Tony's death in endgame was lessened to me because I knew going in that either him or captain America we're going to die. Civil War didn't seem very high stakes because no one really suffered true consequences from the film. Even Rhoades had his ability to walk artificially restored in his next scene",1
"Definitely. Aside from just being a fan of his and wanting it because of that. I think it‚Äôs really cool that there‚Äôs supporters who aren‚Äôt necessarily fans but understand that releasing it is really the ethically right thing to do here. Artists and storytellers aren‚Äôt just robots, they‚Äôre people in need of support to.",2
"No, you're just being edgy",0
"> nstead of using the original director's footage, reshooting 3/4 of the movie from your previous experience in a similar field but with a completely different aesthetic, ruining it, and delivering an entirely different end result.   That's what WB want: Different direction. Otherwise they would let Zach stay.",0
I'm sure Atlanteans have more than one outfit they wear; especially in a situation like this where Steppenwolf is trying to take back the Mother Box they were protecting.,2
It also makes shadows and darkness look incredible which can lead to some crazy unique shots.,2
"I don‚Äôt know, things are leaning to say otherwise! I‚Äôm trying to remain optimistic about it haha",2
"I mean, he was fine in the movie, but after reading the character from the New 52 to Rebirth, it wasn't nearly as interesting or compelling.",1
I mean wan mindset is pretty good I think. If it‚Äôs a big action blockbuster he will make a fun crowd pleasing movie that‚Äôs cheesy and has a lot of heart. If it‚Äôs horror or not a action blockbuster it will be more gritty and serious. I don‚Äôt personally mind that. I grew up on cheese anyway lol.,2
"That ending did moved me too but yeah, Wan (and Patty too) is good but definitely overrated on this sub.",1
Wan did say his requirement for Aquaman 2 was he wanted a better script.  Terrio? Please?,3
Imagine getting it directly from the source and still asking for the source lmao. Wat,3
Link it then.,0
That‚Äôs like taking the president at his word just because he‚Äôs the president.,0
"Has to be satire, there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs serious.",1
"Their version of Braniac was *fantastic*, too...I'm pretty disappointed actually that it got canceled...maybe we'll get lucky and this new HBO deal will lead to the renewing of Krypton and Swamp Thing, which was one of the best things DC has done in live action in quite some time from my point of view!",3
"yeah, I like that Snyder didn't hold the viewer's hand with little things like those scenes at Lex's event where Clark picked up on who Bruce was, but I feel some things just went over many people's heads, especially those not too familiar with comics.",2
"The Martha moment doesn't even make sense with Bruce's arc either.  He realizes he's become the very thing he always fought against, a killer with a gun and the very next thing he does is kill a bunch of people   As much as people talk about a greater plan it's things like that which tell me Snyder had no idea what he was doing",1
"you literally said "" the only poor part"" as a statement",1
"> Artists and storytellers aren‚Äôt just robots, they‚Äôre people in need of support to.  *Especially* when some personal tragedy happens that requires someone else to come in and finish your work...and the end result is far removed from your original vision!  I mean...the man had *Darkseid* in the film...who the hell cuts THAT out?!",1
"Ok, boomer.",1
Cuckolding is possibly the most disgusting fetish known to man.,0
He left because his daughter committed suicide you numpty.,1
Having more than one outfit and looking like an entirely different person are two different things.,0
"'has alot of heart' when people revert to using that phrase, it tends to be a shite film that is as you say made for all ages... But kids really. An adult can watch anything, kids can't.",0
I really hope so. The script was by far the worst part of the movie.,3
"Where did he say that? Because looking at the IMDB of it, it looks like they just cut out one of the other screenwriters and didn't change anything else.",1
I‚Äôd bet they believe all the bloggers on twitter that way it doesn‚Äôt exist over the people who worked on it too.,2
https://vero.co/zacksnyder/Fss-61DVnNZ9P8L9JkT3bzB,2
I mean that‚Äôs true if what the president releases is pictures of a movie he directed. Otherwise that comparison makes zero sense.,1
Like why did he only post it on vero. If it‚Äôs real and proves the so-called Snyder cut is real why just post it on fucking vero of all places?,1
Oh it got cancelled? Classic fucking scy-fy channel man. I haven‚Äôt watched swamp thing yet but I‚Äôd heard it goes alright,3
"He's not just suddenly fixed after the Martha scene.  It just makes him confront his old wounds and gives him a chance to finally heal them by ""saving Martha.""  If you think that the martha sequence magically turns Bruce Wayne around, you aren't watching the movie.    You want to see Batman doing Batman things?  People are gonna die, it's that simple.  He's killed in EVERY single cinematic version, and explicitly kills in several comics over the years.  The only difference is that BvS doesn't avoid the result of being a Bat Vigilante.  It follows through on what that means if you push that idea to its brink.    So you don't really have a problem with Batman killing, you have a problem with how the movie uses it.  And you know what?  That's the fucking point.  Grow up.",0
Doesn‚Äôt make it a statement of fact. Movies are pretty well always discussed as a subjective.,1
There was such much cut...I guess GL was in there to...ugh...,1
"What a group of consenting adults do in privacy is their business, not yours",0
"AH shit, here we go this ""reason"" again.  Making Justice League help him forget the pain of his passing daughter, he wouldn't just left like that. WB don't want his vision on DCEU/WoDC. See him posting these JL photos? That prove his passion on JL.",0
He only looks different because his hair is not CGI'd,1
He doesn't? At most he had a hair cut between JL and Aquaman.,0
Well Im not one of those people lol. I just think aqua man is pretty cheesy and emotional.,2
Very similar to how the Snyder fans use the word ‚Äúdeep‚Äù.,1
Yeah. I loved Aquaman since the natural charisma of the actors and general directing made the script mostly a non-issue (Much like the first Raimi Spiderman which also had a terrible script). But that shine only works for one movie. Hopefully we can get our Spiderman 2 equivalent.,2
The script (story) was fine. The dialogue needed work,1
Looks like a photoshop. Why not put it up on Twitter or something.,0
"He posts on Vero because he‚Äôs a flagship user of it who benefits in some fashion from doing so, probably in the form of some kickback. His friend owns it. He‚Äôs been posting almost exclusively on Vero for a couple of years now. He does occasionally use Twitter but their goal with having him and others use Vero has been to get more users on it.  You‚Äôre just coming off as really ignorant of the past couple of years of events, also highly combative for no reason. What is your conspiracy theory with the many, many photos he has released?",1
"yeah, they canceled Krypton AND the Lobo spinoff (Lobo was absolutely hilarious and I'd definitely have watched that show)...though there were some rumors floating around that they were shopping both shows to other networks.  Swamp Thing was great, especially if you're into horror (mostly body horror like The Thing, Hellraiser, etc.) and the practical effects were on point.  Definitely worth a watch even though it's been canceled.",1
"Firstly M can you not swear? Not trying to be a prude but it makes you sound petulant.  Secondly no one's asking him to be magically fixed in the Martha scene. I myself would have just liked to see some more consistency with his whole epiphany in the previous scene. As in not starting by having him divebomb some randos.  Secondly we're not talking about other cinematic variants here, we're talking about Batfleck and his arc in relation to the film. Bringing other cinematic Batmen into the debate is a whack argument and I'm frankly tired of people using it  But since you wanted to bring other Batmen into this let's do that.  I would point out that the Burton Batman was pretty damn far removed from anything Batman (Guy himself has said he refuses to read a comic ever). Then you have the Nolan films which yeah he does kill in but there's two caveats to this. Firstly the League guys were before his becoming Batman and Harvey's death was clearly accidental (You have to be blind to ignore this). Other then that Nolan's didn't kill to my knowledge.  Also by killing in the comics if you mean the 30/s Batman or the assorted elseworlds you are objectively wrong. Virtually nothing of the Batman in the 30's got maintained (Many appearences were retconned to be Earth 2 I believe) and the elseworlds aren't even fucking worth mentioning. There's one where Superman is adopted by the Waynes, should that be his origin in Man of Steel?  Also pretty much every Batman incarnation at some point touches on the nature of vigilantism and it's positive and negative implications. It's not a new thing Snyder pioneered here, it is a basic concept in the genre. Snyder did have a good take on an older, bitter Batman but that's not my issue.  My issue is not even how Batman kills, it's that the ""Save Martha"" scene is robbed of it's poignancy by the next scene because Snyder didn't even attempt to show Bruce at least attempting to keep this in mind. Especially when his last scene in the film is him explaining his epiphany to Diana   That is my fundamental  problem with Bruce Wayne's voyage in this film",1
I suppose so. Sorry for being pedantic,1
"I'm fairly certain I read somewhere that there was at least 2.5-3 hours of Snyder's footage that just sat on the cutting room floor, and that Joss added about 1-1.5 hours of his own stuff into the final cut...it's essentially a completely different movie, and I really hope the fans eventually get to see it.  Hell, I'll take unfinished effects and people holding up pieces of paper with ""Metropolis"" written on them as title cards haha.",2
When was GL in the Cut?,1
Okay? How is that relevant to my feelings about it?,1
Kay dude,1
"If you believe Snyder's and Wan's characterizations are same, you do you.  I don't and think them wildly different. Wan and Momoa did too as is obvious by their interviews on topic and such.",1
"It‚Äôs just literally up in a bun in Aquaman.  Northernlightspls is part of a select group of users here who have had their many many beliefs regarding Snyder and the DCEU films shaken over the past months and are still coming to terms with it, as such they will desperately be trying to move the goalposts as much as possible. Before outright plot contradictions to other films were celebrated because it meant ‚Äúmoving away from Snyder‚Äù even if it creates huge gaps in the DCEU‚Äôs logic, now cosmetic  contradictions are bad because ‚Äúreasons‚Äù.",1
"Don't get me wrong lol, I've seen it, and it's not emotional. When something's forced and predictable, it's hard to really get emotional behind it, imo.",1
"No, not 'deep' D E P T H, the story and characters have depth. You're welcome. I don't know anyone who uses deep, as someone who likes Snyder's work.",1
Oh hell yeah. I think most of us would. Haha that be funny. Still better storytelling that Whedon.,1
"I‚Äôm not sure. There‚Äôs this https://heroichollywood.com/zack-snyder-justice-league-green-lantern-ship/  And there‚Äôs been some buzz around an actor, Sam Benjamin : https://twitter.com/sambenjaminnow/status/1197235159847882755?s=21  There‚Äôs reason to believe he was Hal Jordan.",1
Why are your feelings towards it remotely relevant at all?,1
You mad bro? Lol,1
"Wait, so you're talking about characterization? I was talking about looks. And how would you know how he would be characterized in Justice League when none of us involved in the process has seen it?",1
That‚Äôs fine. I think differently,1
"It‚Äôs exactly the same thing. When they talk about D E P T H, it usually means that the film is shite.",1
Looking at the ship I think it's more Apokalips based (Makes sense since I think we see one like it in the History Lesson)  Also is Sam the military subplot guy?  That I'm thinking could be Hal's origin but Snyder tends to have pretty large arcs in his films that show differing perspectives (Like the journey of that one guy in BVS or the rumoured scenes with the policeman and Lois),1
"Why are your feelings towards someone using the word ""cuckold"" remotely relevant at all?   Why are your feelings towards me sharing my feelings about the word remotely relevant at all?  You can stick rusty nails up your ass, that's your right as an adult. I may not like it but I can't stop you, just like you can't stop me having an opinion about it.",1
Oh yeah. Couldn't stand being owned epic style bro üò≠üò≠üò≠  /s lol,1
"I mean, based on the characters that were in both movies, looks were different too. Mera's hair, Arthur's eyes, their costumes and so on.  >Characterizations  I'm talking about that based on an interview I read back in the day. Jason was talking about how they both had their own unique take on them.",1
"Depth is actually a clear indicator that film has a good narrative and explores it with little plot gaps and a great script.  Saying something 'has heart' is the complete opposite. Referring to something as 'deep' in a movie is what you would consider the ending of ff7.   So no, they're not the same thing, aside the fact they are two completely different words. Maybe you just don't understand Snyder's work yet. Maybe you will when you're older.   Sleep well little prince.",1
The ship? Snyder confirmed it was a GL ship in the link.   Yes. It could be. I was think Hal was already GL and came back when all this was going down.,1
Because calling someone a cuckold is a lazy insult and it's just people being edgy,1
"I didn‚Äôt say they are the same words, dumdum. ‚ÄúMaybe you don‚Äôt understand‚Äù also falls into the same category. His movies are shite.",0
"And picking a fight with someone because you think their choice of insult is ""lazy"" isn't?",1
">It‚Äôs exactly the same thing.  You did, when they are clearly not. The fact you needed that explaining to you tells me you probably do struggle to understand the creative comprehension that Snyder's capable of giving.  If you think they're shit, stick to marvel. Pretty simple.",1
"The words ‚Äúthing‚Äù and ‚Äúwords‚Äù don‚Äôt have identical meaning, dumdum. The only one struggling here is you, sweetie.",0
So what did mean then???. Lol keep circle jerking.,1
"Not actually a pun from Lex. But this :  "" God is tribal. God takes sides. No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy to deliver me from Daddy's fist and abominations.

"As soon as I saw this movie and heard the hate, I couldn't comprehend what people said. I knew this film wouldn't be appreciated in its own time.",1
"All these puns and references, using Greek mythology and etymology during the Gala speech etc cleverly suggest how well read, well informed and genius Lex is; instead of using other characters to constant refer to him as a 'genius' or a 'mastermind' which is a trait in many movies. Some of the true characters of a genius are to remember all that he has read and seamlessly use that in daily conversations in different ways and that was very well depicted.  Also by doing this, they put the audience in a position to be smart enough to get these references.  I was mesmerized by the writing in this movie, especially Lex's dialogues and I was bummed when my friends didn't share the appreciation.",1

Find someone that looks at you the way Cavill does with Affleck.,1
"The trinity is the Soldier, the Knight and the God.",1
I think Ben's batman is the most hard-core I've seen of all the other batman his fight scene in bvs when he was saving Martha is hard hitting like Captain America fight scenes sadly we would never get to see him again or not read something of him likely to reprise his role in a very uncertain justice league Sequel,1
Does Snyder have any other project in the pipeline? Seems like he‚Äôs always sharing pics of this movie,2
That batsuit with the white eyes would‚Äôve been the best I‚Äôve ever seen I think,2
\- Is she with you?  \+ Yes,2
gal is so sexy,2
"I'm gonna be honest, i don't know much about DC or Batman, but holy shit Batfleck with a decent script would be glourious, look at that mountain of a man!  Sad how everything turned out.",2
"They gave us near perfection with the MoS suit, and then it got worse in BvS and then worse again for JL.   They gave us an awesome Batsuit in BvS, and then messed it for JL.  Bummer.",2
"Beautiful.   Just a minor nitpick: probably the best Batsuit but the cowl is one of the worst, specially the eyes (not talking about the Night Owl glasses) and how bloated Ben looks.",2
"I still find it funny people complained about Gal being too skinny. But her standing next to Ben and Henry shows how irrelevant that is. Remember, Ben is the tallest and biggest Batman, he is 6'4""  She looks perfect.",2
Seals in the flavor.,1
"Hope Supes next suit doesn‚Äôt have those stupid looking muscles built into them, or at least make them more natural and subtle looking.",1
Damn.. what a shot.  It's sad to think we may never get to see The Snyder Cut,1
Anyone got the picture in high-res?,1
Henry Cavill was the best superman,1
triple thi c c,1
batman looks like a fat redditor trying to cosplay,1
Hush batman is good batman,1
"Beautiful casting, wish it would‚Äôve worked out.",1
They look like action figures lol,1
"Move on, Zach.  The rest of us have.",1
I didn't like in JL how you could see the muscle suit on Cavill. It broke immersion...,1
It just doesn't feel right without the capes.,1
Can we get something substantial?,1
"I‚Äôm sure we will see them again in the future :). Maybe a distant future, but I‚Äôm sure we will. Gal is still WW and second movie coming in 2020, and I‚Äôm sure they will do a third, Henry, as far as I‚Äôm concerned, is still Superman, and we will get PatBat :).",1
"is he just trolling the fans at this point, whats happening",1
Ben looks so bloated here,0
Batfleck looks a bit chubby in the cowl,0
Batman looks like Daredevil on steroids.,0
"Fatfleck lol, but man I miss seeing these 3, JL was SO BAD, Snyder Cut!!",0
"Imagine holding on pathologically to that one proyect you worked on 10 years ago, and still be tweeting weekly pics.",0
Let it go Elsa,0
Yeh because thats a healthy body image to put into young boys and girls minds. Right. Hypocrisy lmao.,0
That bat suit looks like shit...a little puzzling considering the suit in BvS looked great.,0
"Lmao, the real trinity is Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor.",0
"Batman looks like he needs some beano. Also, that cowl doesn‚Äôt even mesh with the suit. It pokes out. I know I‚Äôm in the minority on this one, but everything about Batfleck always felt like a square peg through a round hole.",0
"I was never a fan of this Batsuit even though it borrows heavily from AA, which I thoroughly enjoy.",0
"Fatfleck is bigger than Cavill's Superman, and he's supposed to look tiny next to Bane",0
"If Henry‚Äôs ever done as superman, I‚Äôd like a slightly less buffed up version of the character. Sort of leaner and younger Superman, you know.",0
In a twist the Court of Owls got to Bruce already.,3
You mean nite owl?,2
"I think he‚Äôs wearing the BVS cowl in all the reshoots. In the ‚ÄúI DIDNT BRING A SWOOORD‚Äù line, I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the BVS cowl. Which btw, ‚Äúmy turn‚Äù was such a better line. Fuckin Whedon man",3
Well it is Night Owl's outfit   The tactical suit still looks sick,1
I think that batfleck having such a short run saddens me more.,3
I think over the past two years zack has been using his own wealth to complete his own cut. he dose own an effect studio,3
"But we‚Äôre getting Gal, BatPat and maybe even a Michael B Superman. Potentially a course corrected bright future ahead. Give me Michael B. Jordan in anything!",0
"Garbage goes in the trash  Edit: Not sure if you realize this, but your sub displays on r/all. If you don't want your circle jerk interrupted, you might consider going private.",0
Check out the original post on Vero for higher resolution.,3
She spoke to him during the fight scene something along the lines of kal-el of krypton remember who you are.but then supes just fucked her up.,3
They didn't speak to each other in BvS either. Just a 1 liner during the Doomsday fight.,1
"It‚Äôs not his call if it is/isn‚Äôt. He clearly did his own thing with his DC movies (thanks from those who loved that), maybe now he‚Äôs trying to be a little more amenable so that his cut can finally come out, so he‚Äôll play by their rules. At least until it comes out.  This is all speculation, of course. Idk, it just seemed like we were close to getting an answer, and now I‚Äôm back to not knowing what to hell to think    I would absolutely **love** to see this movie, but I have no idea if & when it will.",3
"It‚Äôs not up to Snyder though. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd love for his actual vision to see the light of day. Also, he‚Äôs loving the support for now",3
"[Forbes, on the other hand, says it will.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2019/11/26/dear-warner-bros-release-the-snyder-cut/)",2
"Until WB crawls out of the woodwork and stop being cowards and say ""It's not coming"", the Snyder Cut campaign is still gonna keep going.  These articles keep using phrases like ""Anonymous sources tell us"" or ""Knowledgeable insiders say"" and these are just non statements. These same anonymous sources and insiders said last year that there was definitively no Snyder Cut and look at what we know now.   They also ignore that literally everyone involved with the Snyder Cut wants it.   Tbh, I've no idea why WB are hiding it. The Snyder Cut is so anticipated now and will make a lot of money if they release it. I'd even make an argument that the Snyder Cut is just as (if not more) anticipated than WW84",3
"It‚Äôs not up to him, and the ‚Äú‚Äòmajor trade‚Äù simply said WB declined to comment.",2
>That‚Äôs 2 major trades.  It really sucks.   There's your answer,2
He wants it to come out but has no clout of his own so he keeps trying to use the fanbase to get WB to release it. They have no desire or incentive to release it because they movie bombed and they ain't spending more money on that.  The situation is as obvious as it gets.,2
Because it's the only one we got on big screen?,3
the one from dexter is pretty good too though,1
Surely not now.,3
This was shot by Snyder.  You can see a fraction of how this looked like from the first trailer. ( close up shots for every hero ),3
Whedon reshot scenes that Zack had already done....for some bizarre reason,3
Yes! I don't care with all that yang about he doesn't kill or use guns. Ben's Batman was the Batman I've wanted for the longest time. That warehouse scene was pure fire!,1
"He posts about non-DC projects which are not posted here, of course.",2
"His next film is called Army of the Dead and it will be out on Netflix soon. Dave Bautista is in it :)   https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/  He sharing picks of this movie with fans that want to see them, and those picks get shared to this subreddit directly because behind the scenes content for any DC film is relevant to this sub. It also helps build hype towards the potential release of the SC of JL.",1
"He has a deal with Netflix right now, believe he‚Äôs working on a show for them.",1
You‚Äôre only aloud to share photos of your current projects? Not ones that never saw the light of day?   Also he knows he‚Äôs fueling the fire because he knows WB will inevitably break.,2
She is super skinny in real life. Check her insta.,0
"Yeah they went overboard with that, Henry doesn‚Äôt need the padding so I hope the next suit has less.",1
We will. Mark my words.,2
"Not this sub unfortunately, most of the posts on here are about Snyder.",1
That's because that Batman IS LITERALLY Daredevil on steroids,1
You really think a Snyder Cut will be any different? I believe it won‚Äôt live up to everyone‚Äôs expectations.,0
Obvious bait is obvious.,2
Imagine wasting time out of your day to pop into threads about directors and films you don't like just to troll in the comment section simply because you're a salty little cunt.,1
Noooo remember RelEasE SnYDer CuT!!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ Directs a terrible movie then he is surprised when the studio cut him off lol,0
The armor looked kinda cool,1
lmao no  take your company war bullshit the fuck out,1
Why? That doesn't make any sense. Superman isn't typically a lean guy. He is supposed to be like the original Strongman style. He is SUPERMAN ya know? Strength is one of his most notable features and his body is supposed to be a physical representation of his strength while having a larger then life physique.,0
I'm assuming they're talking about the Owlman who is Earth-3's Crime Syndicate equivalent of Batman,1
its not...,3
I'm cool with my turn being cut honestly. It's such a cliched line (It'd be like someone asking you and what army),1
For me Cavill deserved better.,3
"I feel like Diana needs an upgrade.   Only Zack is the only one cool enough to give her a badass upgrade that goes against the grain of how other people would imagine her; Marvel-like and too conservative with their idea of her; that she‚Äôs gentle and political with grace, and not the rough hard ass side of her.",2
Hard pass on Michael B. Jordan as Superman,3
Not as Superman . Fuck that noise,3
‚ÄúOnscreen together‚Äù,1
There is no course lol. There is just less risks in terms of plot. WW84 will prove me right :),2
I loved Calvin Ellis Superman. President and superman. Thats the shit right there,1
Michael B. Jordan in a Superman movie about Val-Zod would be incredible.,0
Superman is supposed to be white.,0
Bad comment,0
So what are you doing here then? Don't you have somewhere to be?,3
Same with your life,3
So... when are you headed out?,3
"Wow, what a contradicting statement considering none of the three are trash",2
Does one line to amnesia Superman really count?,3
"""Kalel no\~!""",1
I hope so!,1
"Well said. WB could actually end snyder cut movement with a simple tweet saying ""We have no intention of releasing a nearly incomplete version of Justice League""  Till something like that happen, the movement will go strong forward.   However Nov 17th was the peak moment for RTSC fandom. People are still talking about their success and how alot of articles came out to cover the movement.   This is WB's biggest and expensive and probably the most ambitious film ever. And they've been hiding it in their vault for 2 years.   The time is right now. ""Snyder Cut"" is chining everywhere on cyberspace. Those unaware of the movement have taken notice.  This is the time to get an announcement.",3
" very well said my friend, the media misinform, they take us away from the truth, that's why zack communicates with us independently",3
That's like literally how sourcing works in journalism though. I get what you mean but are we really going to complain about proper journalistic practices?,2
"If they published name of their sources, we know for certainty they would get abused and harassed on social media platforms. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out.",2
Make a lot of money? I just don‚Äôt see it happening,2
"I think it feels as anticipated as WW84, but that truly WW is at much higher numbers. It‚Äôs easy to feel that way with the movement and in this sub though.",1
I never said it was but he def knows if it‚Äôs got the potential to happen or not. If not he should set the record straight.,2
"Major trades reporting the classic ‚Äúa nameless source of a nameless source said‚Äù though. And HP got something wrong recently, the whole Joker2 thing.",3
Sadly.,1
Yeah but he should know the actual potential so if there isn‚Äôt any he should stop provoking it.,1
True dat. Just trying to say they're awesome,3
"There are other trinities too, like Harry/Ron/Hermione or Tony/Steve/Thor. We just like DC's main trinity best.",1
It was reshot again by Whedon for the ‚Äúglad I didn‚Äôt miss this‚Äù close uo,2
"For masterpieces like ""I'll try to keep up"" or ""What is Brunch?"".",3
The reason isn't that bizzare. WB wanted to go a different direction and that's why he was brought on.,1
Well in the Snyder cut Cyborg dies. So it makes sense in the Whedon cut to reshoot group shots where he would be present.,0
Well that‚Äôs not exactly what he said but that‚Äôs still true. You do live in a fucking dreamworld if you think they don‚Äôt or never have. Sorry.,3
"That's not what he said. He said you're living in a Dreamworld if you think that they make no mistakes. Mistakes include the neck snap and Batman going brutal after years of losing faith in humanity. He never said the killing would continue, they were mistakes by the heroes after all.",1
show me the quote,1
"I presume you meant ""if you can't accept them killing"" rather than ""not killing"".  But rewatch every single Batman film and every time he hits or otherwise injures someone, I want you to pause the movie and consider what that injury could do to someone IRL. Then for each one, think how likely it is that someone would get severely injured if that damage was inflicted on them by someone with the training and hardware of Batman.  Then reconsider if you think it's ""living in a dream world"" to imagine that people never die at Batman's hands and (more to the point) that you've never seen him do anything onscreen that would lead to a death that he could have prevented.",1
Cool cool. The sample size of what I‚Äôm exposed to is one-sides. I only see posts about his posts here so I wasn‚Äôt aware of that üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ,1
"Thanks! Didn‚Äôt know about this. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs found something else to do and I hope he moves on. The man has been through a lot lately.  Hopefully, it‚Äôs a critical and financial hit",1
"I didn‚Äôt say he wasn‚Äôt allowed to share what he wants. But it seems that he keeps sharing pics of a movie that already came out when he could be sharing pics of upcoming projects instead.   Look, I LOVE man of steel. But let‚Äôs be honest, zack‚Äôs record is not one to guarantee a better movie.",1
We definitely will. Never lose hope.,1
"The fan service alone sounds better, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Darkseid ending, and more that was scrapped",1
no way its any worse than the shit whedon put out.,1
"So you saw the cut then? First it didn't exist, then it needed $$ to be completed... Now they won't release it? Keep trying hard and keep moving the goalpost.",1
>	That doesn‚Äôt make any sense.  He made plenty of sense before cavill appeared in Man of Steel.,0
"Oh, I'm a dumbass.  My only other thought was maybe it was from court of owls because I never read it but justice league's goggles are literally the same as the ones nite owl wears in the snydermen so I got confused.",1
"Really? Not even in the ‚Äúsave one‚Äù dialogue with Flash? It‚Äôs so noticeably different, maybe it‚Äôs cause Benny put on a few pounds",2
"I always felt that Cavill was dang near perfect as Superman.   I also felt that Ben Afleck was arguably the superior on-screen Batman of all time (fight me).  The only one I didn‚Äôt like was Gadot as Wonder Woman. I thought she did a great job with the character and acting the role, she just wasn‚Äôt buff enough.   I just don‚Äôt look at her and think ‚Äúwarrior‚Äù.",3
Well he's still in so we might see him get better,1
I don‚Äôt want to be the one that compares marvel with DC t what marvel does right is managing the character development of the marvel universe. I mean dc does alright but they just all don‚Äôt make sense in the same universe. Because of that they don‚Äôt really have a long guarantee in the movie universe.,1
"I'd bloody love to see him as some hero in the DCEU but if they swap out Cavill and hope we don't care, then it's going to take a whole lot of convincing before I want to see that film.",3
"Check your zipper because your racism is showing.   Superman is an alien from Krypton and can be any actor. The reason he‚Äôs been white is bc he was created in 1938. Maybe it‚Äôs time he gets an update. Why not just get the best actor to play Superman. If Henry Cavill or WB can work it out, why not keep him. If WB wants to go a different direction why not update Superman?",1
"I mean, it‚Äôs a DC Cinematic sub.  It has not and will never be exclusive to Snyder‚Äôs work.  If someone came here and said Halle Berry‚Äôs catwoman was trash would you tell them to leave?",1
"The actors are great, what they signed on for wasn't",0
"No I'm just being pedantic I guess,the film as shit anyway snyder got fucked over and we all lost out because a bunch if critics and get babies wanted a marvel replica.",3
">We have no intention of releasing a nearly incomplete version of Justice League""  This wouldn't end the movement. We all know WB weren't interested and if they had their way the cut would never have caught so much attention. The campaign was about forcing WB's hand in reality. It was clear that WB weren't our friends so we had to force them to do something they didn't want to by raising awareness and creating momentum and demand for the Snyder Cut. Now WB are basically losing money by not moving on that push.    If WB did say they have no intention we would just try harder",2
"Just as Variety's article came up,  he shared this image. He dont want the RTSC fandom to feel discouraged.   Also Forbes published a new article which is amazing. Written by someone who initially didn't believe in the snyder cut and now supports its release. Check it out :)",3
You're missing the point. WB should stop hiding behind nameless and faceless sources and just man up and say it not coming if they have no plans,1
"Snyder's movies did very well on home media  BvS made $53 million in Home Media sales  MoS made $112 million in DVD/Blu Ray sales  None of this includes digital purchases  If the Snyder Cut was released and proved popular, it make these numbers and maybe even more",3
Oh of course you don‚Äôt. üôÑ,0
If he‚Äôd be allowed too. It‚Äôs a matter legally in WB‚Äôs hands.,2
"Being anonymous doesn't discredit it tho.  And of course it's anonymous, they don't want to get harrassed on social media platforms by hoards of fanboys.  If you'd rather believe screenrant than variety because it says things you like, that's a different matter.",1
Why would he? He wants his movie be it by hook or crook.,1
"Idk. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimmli is hard to beat.",2
"Luke/Han/Leia, you walking carpets",3
"Well yeah, but you get what I was implying.",2
you must be crazy if you think this is better than Tony/Steve/Thor.,0
The cinematic DC trinity sure isn't the best,0
Carrie Anne Moss one of the best Trinities.   Meh on the Disney trinity there...,0
The trio standing together.. am I correct?  Always felt something weird about it.,2
"[Nope, he was in the original group shot](https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F426360%252F1284d302-01df-4867-903e-8200526d67b4.gif%252Ffull-fit-in__950x534.gif?signature=aXVN052FXtwTy6yYGKKt_2-7Vo8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com)",3
I had no problem with Superman killing Zod but Batman was just ruthless.,2
"I dunno. A universe in which Batman kills but the Joker, of all people, is still breathing strikes me as even more laughably absurd than anything out of ""campy Batman"".",1
"And I'm glad that the dude who thinks that way is no longer in charge of these characters. Thank god, could you imagine a world where Shazam is killing folks? I love living in my dream world",1
"‚ÄúSomeone says to me, ‚ÄòBatman killed a guy.‚Äô I‚Äôm like, ‚Äòf*ck, really? Wake the f*ck up,'‚Äù explained Snyder. ‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Once you‚Äôve lost your virginity to this f*cking movie and then you come and say to me something about like, ‚ÄòMy superhero wouldn‚Äôt do that.‚Äô I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòAre you serious?‚Äô I‚Äôm like down the f*cking road on that.‚Äù  He continued, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cool point of view to be like, ‚ÄòMy heroes are still innocent. My heroes didn‚Äôt fucking lie to America. My heroes didn‚Äôt embezzle money from their corporations. My heroes didn‚Äôt fucking commit any atrocities.‚Äô That‚Äôs cool. But you‚Äôre living in a fucking dream world.‚Äù",1
"Lots of variables and that's a very different thing from mowing down people without a care in the world but if they're equivalent to you, you do you I guess?",0
Yeah I am looking forward to it too. I really enjoyed his version of Dawn of the Dead.  And hopefully we will also get to see the Snyder Cut of JL one day.,1
"His movie never came out.   By his track record, his JL will be significantly better than whatever was in theaters.   Either get salty he keeps sharing JL stuff or ignore it. You‚Äôre choice bud.",1
Ooo we got a smart guy here.,1
"Beyond any discussion regarding Snyder‚Äôs films, it‚Äôs worrying that you really think I could take you seriously with such a childish comment.   To make fun of something other people find well written and/or profound because you disagree with them showe insecurity and nothing else.",1
"It's actually pretty obvious, batman becomes the killer and Superman becomes the child at that point, I don't know why it foew over so many people's heads.",0
Loool yeah I'm sure there is a big conspiracy and we just gate keeping the Great Zack Snyder lol I saw his cut of BvS and I'd rather never seen another one of his movies.,0
"What does that even mean? Superman is typically not a leaner guy. He's Superman. A strong, physically imposing and impressive guy. That's like saying Thor should be leaner.",0
"it's the owl cowl, eyes are different, mask is slimmer",2
"In her one and a half movies I thought she was good. Consider the trinity of marvel, their first movies are flat compared to the latter ones. This arrangement would‚Äôve only gotten better. :/",3
"Ugh, I haven't seen that old ""she isn't buff enough"" comment for a while and thought everyone was well over that by now. I guess not. I don't want my Wonder Woman to look like a professional body builder. Gadot is great and looks great in the role too.",3
Dude I‚Äôve BEEN saying that. Ben was amazing as the bat.,2
"Seeing how she served two years in the Israel defense force as a combat instructor, I don‚Äôt think being muscular is what should make a female masculine.",2
I suppose you don't think the Israel Defense Forces are warriors either.   Despite however we all may view Amazons and whether or not Gal was will be subjective but I just like to point out how Gal has served in the armed forced for two years as a combat instructor and interestingly enough she also studied law and international relations. Gal may not be the WW that Darywn Cooke had at towering Superman but she is very much fit and active but most importantly she has this aura and charm about her. Regardless of Amazon heritage Gal's Diana is a demigod so that helps explain any further suspension of disbelief needed to believe Gal can be as powerful as Wonder Woman.,2
Her muscle mass never bothered me but in my opinion she is a horrible actress. That's what I could never fully get over.,1
He‚Äôs a bit of an over actor in Black Panther and Creed but he‚Äôs ok overall. I‚Äôll take him in a role but not that one. WB doesn‚Äôt even care about being progressive they are just thinking of doing it because they see $$$. Batman makes them a ton of money and you never hear a whisper of this type of change for him.,2
"It would be some new universe, like in Battinson‚Äôs universe. Which Gal will not be in.",1
"Superman is the physical embodiment of the american dream, that a seemingly average person could come to the country and be super. To properly represent this, Superman has to be white. He is supposed to be the average American, and most Americans are white.   Also, your language is worrying. Is the only way to shake up a character by erasing their racial history? His writing doesn't matter, but his skin colour does? With all due respect u/thefalcon85, you sound like a real pathetic person. If you're white, you're trying way too hard to be liked by black people. If you're black, you're being a child.  Check your zipper, your idiocy is showing.",1
Why Marvel?,1
So immature,0
"The fire rises, brother",2
Excelente bro!!!!!!,2
"Did you not read what I said? Or are you unaware of anonymous sourcing? This is them saying they won't release it.  Y'all were vehemently in denial of Batfleck leaving for 2 years even when big trades kept reporting it. And now it's being done for RTSC.   Well, keep asking for it and they'll continue not doing anything on it.",1
"According to the latest estimates, MOS did 116 million and BvS did 78 million ;)",3
Having a name doesn‚Äôt either. And so far everything anonymous sources said has been proven wrong by named people who *actually* worked on the film.   ScreenRant at least doesn‚Äôt write whole articles based on what ‚Äúan insider of a source of my grandma said üò≤‚Äù. I really wish it was just a matter of what I like.,1
Carrie Anne Moss is so hot,1
"Yeah  First we see the whole team in frame and then we see them from behind, which are Snyder.  Then we get that close up of just the trio, which is a reshoot. The lighting on Wonder Woman doesn‚Äôt match Bats and Supes. I doubt Batfleck was there with Cavill either.",2
No shit haha. Did you not watch the film to understand why? Or does context not matter?,1
Ah. a frequent response from someone who got their Batman history lesson from a YouTube video.  Study the history of Batman in comics. Read Batman #402. Read TDKR. Watch the live-action films and then come back to me and we‚Äôll talk about Batman and his rule and killing.,0
"Hey that‚Äôs great, more power to you. You still have campy Batman.",0
Did you choose to ignore what he said before or are you just being ignorant,2
"I don't believe u/uberduger was saying that they are equivalent. He is saying that if you examine the idea of someone doing the kind of violence which Batman does in a real world setting would not only seriously injure the people which he takes down, but it's likely that things would get out of hand and he would accidentally kill some of them.",1
"Dude. His track record is not good.   These is his RT scores are a director   - dawn of the dead - 2004 75% - 300 - 2007 60% - watchmen - 2009 64% - legends of the guardians - 2010 51% - man of steel (which I love) - 2013 56% - justice league - 2017 40% (still credited as such)   His highest % is for Wonder Woman (93%) and he was a producer for that movie. Look, I get that you want the cut to be released (and I‚Äôll watch it if it is), but to say that his JL would be significantly better than what was released is not guaranteed. Given his track record...it might not even be true.    Heck, it‚Äôs more likely that JL would have been better received if Whedon actually had been there from the start. His track record is at least better than Snyder‚Äôs.    Either ignore that real criticism is warranted or get salty when it‚Äôs pointed out. Your choice bud.",0
"Who the fuck finds this garbage well written? When he took bits and pieces of Miller's writing and turned into garbage and all I see on this sub is ""release the cut""",0
" ""flew over so many heads"" hahaha   He took away one of the greatest Batman's monologues and delivered a piece of shit line.  It didn't go over anybody's heads. It was a poorly written scripted. How can you even enjoy it? We had one of the best battles between two brothers brought to us by Frank Miller and instead we got this shit??? And somehow y'all praise him for it.",0
>	That‚Äôs like saying Thor should be leaner.  Funny how fat Thor happened to be his best received rendition in the mcu yet. Maaaaaay be good characterisation has not a lot of do with being super buffed.,1
"The noes on each mask is very different as well. JL had the nostril patterns while bvs didn't. But yes very much the eyes, JL had a ton of wrinkles around the eyes and bridge of the nose. I imagine to give the appearance of scowling. I wasn't a big fan of it, but maybe that's because alot of batman's scenes appear to be Whedon reshoots which looked like shit.",2
You say that about the Marvel trinity. I think that only applies to Thor and Cap. I would say Iron Man 1 is the best film out of the Iron Man trilogy,2
"For real. Her strength isn't from building a shit ton of muscle, she is a demigod.",3
"Yeah Wonder Woman definitely I do not see as a buff person. Big Barda, sure. But not Diana  Edit: well somebody replied and said ‚ÄúI guess you don‚Äôt know what amazons are,‚Äù but it appears their comment was deleted lmao. Anyways, yes, I know what amazons are, and I‚Äôm quite quite sure they don‚Äôt all have to look buff as all hell. Wonder Woman is a demigod, her powers don‚Äôt come from massive muscles",2
Ben is the best Batman wver. Keaton is my favorite cause he is my Batman but Batflek was incredible. I love the voice. Also moving like the Arkham games Batman was pretty cool. Seeing an older Batman was refreshing.,1
I don't have a dog in the fight of whether she is buff enough but she wasn't a combat instructor.  She taught aerobics.,1
"Who said anything about masculine?  I used the words ""buff"" and ""warrior"".",0
"Also, this might be controversial, but I don't think it's very progressive to switch existing characters ethnicities. Why not just create a new character? Can a black character only thrive if it's riding on the success of an already existing white character?  I don't mind it when it's done well (as in the character's race/sexuality is not their central feature). It's not like one version of a character is expected to be exactly the same as a previous version anyway. But it isn't some big progressive accomplishment and, like you said, the companies only do it for money.",2
"He was ace in Chronicle, which obviously was a superpowers movie.  If you've not seen it, I can't recommend it more highly, at least for it's depiction of telekinesis.",1
I think the real question is ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt we like both?‚Äù The idea that we have to choose is mind boggling to me,2
I genuinely hope so .,2
"So you think Ben and Gal both tweeted it just for laughs the other day, with absolutely no indication anything would come of it?   You honestly think that after 2 years of playing along that it doesn't exist, they just suddenly decide to both tweet about it, in a move that they know will stir people up and cause WB to be asked about it loads more than already?  Lol. That's hilarious.",1
"Whst are they even waiting for at this point? 70 mil more than covers the cost of what it would take to finish the cut and then some.  That is, if it‚Äôs not already done. I‚Äôm sure Zack would pay out of pocket if it meant we could see it.",2
"Ooooh, even better. Thanks for the correction",1
This is Affleck 2.0 all over again.  They'll keep saying it's not coming out and it'll continue being unreleased meanwhile some people in here will keep lying to themselves that it's just around the corner and so on.   Nice way to spend time for some of you I suppose. Denial must feel better than bitter truth.,1
Hey hey relax on the condescension. I watched the movie repeatedly and understand why Batman was like that and what inspired that version. I just didn‚Äôt like it or think it was the best version of Batman to lead a new cinematic universe with.,2
"There's not even a need for that, dude simply has to have a basic understanding of human psychology.  BvS clearly implied that the Joker killed Robin and defiled his suit, that Gotham has a long history with him. If Batman was that far fallen that manslaughter of nameless criminals was no longer an issue to him, someone with as personal a beef with him as the Joker he ***would*** keep alive, just to make him suffer on the long run.  That, or the Joker laid low during the time Batman started killing - which is implied to be either after MoS, or just before BvS. After all, the SS flashback of Harley's capture shows the Batmobile without its BvS minigun.",1
"No need to gate keep or insult him. Sure Batman has killed in the Golden Age, he killed the Joker in TDKR (ambiguously), and in every live action appearance. But discussing this stuff with someone whom shares a different point of view shouldn't come with a combative and condescending tone.   I appreciate that your passionate about this though!",1
"For real. Batman breaks into buildings and beats people to a pulp sometimes, he absolutely embezzles money from his company and even keeps research for his project off the books.  Sure, it's for the ""greater good"", but he's absolutely right. Do that for 20 years, watching your son that you brought into your side life get killed by a villain you let live over and over and over, seeing almost all of your allies turn on you or die.  That's the world Zack was already in. It's past that idealistic bright start, it's Batman on the verge and ultimately the story he was telling was to lead Batman to be reinspired by Superman to be better, like he was. It's actually really a great story, wish we got it lmfao R.I.P JL",2
Nah that's the beginning of the quote from the article I looked at: https://www.indiewire.com/2019/03/zack-snyder-defends-batman-killed-person-1202053359/  Don't really care if there's more either,1
"So, Batman being as trained as he is, wouldn't know how to incapacitate people without injuring them fatally and would leave bodies in his wake. Okaaaay.   Sounds very in line with Affleck's Batman but Batman in general? Naah. Just my thoughts on the matter. You do you. üëç",0
"How cute, you can copy movie scores from RT, the shit stain of cinema. You do realize how irrelevant those are right? Plenty of movies get over scored or under all the time. Just look at current Disney films.   To think you believe Whedon can handle these characters with respect is beyond mind boggling, because he didn‚Äôt. He reshot most of the movie and it was absolutely terrible yet your excuse is ‚Äúhe wasn‚Äôt there from the start‚Äù. Horse honky. He has his chance and he blew it. That‚Äôs the sort of denial that comes from someone who‚Äôs willing to believe anything as long as Snyder gets dumped on.  Lol Whedon made 2 good films. Snyder at least 4.  Get back to me when you have something that remotely makes sense that isn‚Äôt fanboyishly biased.",1
"  >Either ignore that real criticism is warranted or get salty when it‚Äôs pointed out. Your choice bud.  You say, having just blamed him for:  >- justice league - 2017 40% (still credited as such)   That was not his movie. The credit at the front means fuck all - that was **not** his movie. Of the movie we saw, slightly less than 40 minutes was his, and a lot of even that had been fucked with (like how the Memorial Park fight was edited to be in the day rather than at night for instance).  >Heck, it‚Äôs more likely that JL would have been better received if Whedon actually had been there from the start. His track record is at least better than Snyder‚Äôs.    Lol, did you not see the bit where Flash fell on WW's tits? Or the bit where Diane Lane and Amy Adams had to have a ""hilarious"" discussion about how Lois was a ""thirsty"" young reporter? Joss has made some decent movies, but on JL he did not do anything even close to good work, even on the bits that were 100% him.",0
"Actually fat Thor is very mixed, even though I enjoyed it and thought it was interesting. Plus also it's a different direction of the character after we have seen Thor being super muscular and strong as he always is. This is just a version of the character that steeped in a downward turn because he stumbled into a depression. It's part of his character development and how he's going into a negative State and must regain his strength. It's a big shocker because Thor is typically considered one of the strongest Avengers and is always depicted as this large strong muscular guy. If they had started Thor out or if they had done a reboot where he was fat it wouldn't have made sense because that's not how the character is. Does it mean there haven't been moments worth Thor's gotten fat but to say that Thor should always be fat or shouldn't being a strong looking dude would be a silly argument. Same thing applies with Superman some storylines where he doesn't have as much of his muscle mass like in Flashpoint because he's not as strong. However that's just a storyline or certain form of development where he's not depicted as having his strength but Superman is always depicted as a stronger larger character and that's a visual aspect of the character. You take that away you take away the key visual of recognizing the iconic part of Superman. What people don't realize is that these characters are iconic and part of the iconic aspect of it is the visual aspect of it the visual aspect of these characters that show strong or symbolic they look very strong with their visuals.",1
I agree that the first Iron Man is the best one of his movies but his character got better and better to me even though the movies didnt.,2
"Oh for sure. But at the same time, it‚Äôs almost in an AU for how different it is in tone and story. Like, they‚Äôve retconned a bunch of stuff from a movie just over ten years old. Consider how things would‚Äôve changed in 10 years from then on.",1
Wrote this is an earlier reply but relates to this  Despite however we all may view Amazons and whether or not Gal was will be subjective but I just like to point out how Gal has served in the armed forced for two years as a combat instructor and interestingly enough she also studied law and international relations. Gal may not be the WW that Darywn Cooke had at towering Superman but she is very much fit and active but most importantly she has this aura and charm about her. Regardless of Amazon heritage Gal's Diana is a demigod so that helps explain any further suspension of disbelief needed to believe Gal can be as powerful as Wonder Woman.,3
"I like how you leave out the Calisthenics part. Also by record, she was enlisted as a ‚Äúcombat instructor‚Äù either it be for aerobics, health and fitness, or even war time. She devoted a few years for her countries military which is doing a lot more than most of us. Especially the ones that says she was ‚Äúteaching aerobics.‚Äù",1
"That‚Äôs literally the definition of masculinity. Muscular, leadership, courage, figurehead. The word is ‚Äúmasculinity‚Äù not Mansculinity. Plus she didn‚Äôt need to be so muscular, neither was the ones portrayed in the comics. I mean Clark Kent is so much smaller than Batman but he can obliterate anything in front of him. Same reason as Wonder Woman, they‚Äôre not human.",1
"I felt this with Ariel / Little Mermaid.   They could have had a totally different character but set in the same world and called it The Little Mermaid: [Name Relating to Place or Events], then done an Ariel movie, then eventually done a movie where they have both meet each other and go on an adventure.  Surely a new character with their own lore and interesting personality is better than ""oh it's that character you like but reimagined"".",1
">  I don't mind it when it's done well (as in the character's race/sexuality is not their central feature).  A black actor said he wanted to play an alien with traditionally white-looking features and people freaked out; who's really making race a central feature here? Not talking about you specifically, but I can't help but notice the irony of some fans frothing at the mouth at the thought of a character of *a different species* changing skin colors while in the same exasperated breath insisting that a character's race shouldn't matter.",0
"Great point, was what I was getting at but I didn‚Äôt communicate it well. The truth is the fan bases overlap massively, it just doesn‚Äôt always feel that way with the rivalry.",1
"They tweeted because Zack asked them to. Because even after him spurring on fans for 2 years, he couldn't get them to release it. Seems desperate on his part when you think about it. They obliged to help him out.   If there were negotiations happening (which they absolutely are not), they wouldn't need to. The fact is that it ain't coming out any time soon if ever.",0
"Jeesh, I wholeheartedly wish it was as simple as you‚Äôre making it out to be. Affleck eventually confirmed he was done as Batman. WB still has to directly release a public statement (like what they did in regards of Joker‚Äôs press premiere. And no, surprise surprise that wasn‚Äôt from *a source.)*  No one here thinks its just around the corner dude. But sure, if simplyfing things to make SC fans look stupid makes you sleep better.  The people you‚Äôre claiming to deliver  ‚ÄúThE biTTeR trUtH üò´üëå‚Äù said in the article that JL ‚Äúneeded reshoots‚Äù, which got debunked by Jay Oliva (yknow, worked on the film, might know something) not too long after. So much for the ‚Äútruth‚Äù, this is as ‚Äútruthful‚Äù as the ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt exist, its fabled‚Äù thing people loved to parrot last year.",1
I‚Äôm genuinely asking because I didn‚Äôt get the impression you did and frankly still kinda don‚Äôt.   1. You aren‚Äôt supposed to like it. He‚Äôs not the good guy until after the BvS fight.  2. That version isn‚Äôt the best version of Batman just as you aren‚Äôt your best self when your down in the dumps.   If it makes you feel any better I didn‚Äôt like Batman in that state of mind either but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt happen to him and that there can‚Äôt be a story about him almost crossing the line.,0
"He didn't have BvS minigun because it happens after BvS when he's changed.  And how do yo you know he hasn't tried to kill Batman, maybe Joker was hiding and he couldn't find him ? After the Metropolis events he thought he has a way bigger task at hand which determines the fate of the humans.",1
"> There's not even a need for that, dude simply has to have a basic understanding of human psychology.  Hi.  > BvS clearly implied that the Joker killed Robin and defiled his suit, that Gotham has a long history with him.   Yeah. His killing / being ""mean"" is relatively new. I got that part.  > If Batman was that far fallen that manslaughter of nameless criminals was no longer an issue to him, someone with as personal a beef with him as the Joker he would keep alive, just to make him suffer on the long run.  I think that's a reasonable position to take on the matter. I don't happen to agree but it's not nonsensical.  > That, or the Joker laid low during the time Batman started killing   Yeah, this was my go-to justification when I bothered trying to explain it to myself.   The issue is that this discussion usually ends up being BIGGER than the specifics of the BvS manslaughter and devolves into *""if you think Batman can dish out all those beatings to criminals over his career without committing manslaughter then you're crazy""*. That's just too far for me and what I originally thought the comment I responded to was getting at. I may have been wrong.",1
"I think you‚Äôre confused. That was neither gate keeping or an insult. If anything I‚Äôm urging open mindedness. Batman‚Äôs history is not as black and white  and is opened to a wider interpretation than people think, even concrete things like his code.  Look, you can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs the truth with some people, youtube and Wikipedia is their history lesson with so much left out and catered to preference that it‚Äôs nearly impossible to have a legit discussion. Pointing that out is hardly an insult, rather a reality check. I‚Äôm just not afraid to call it what it is.   Anyways, haha yeah..I can be quite passionate and it can get me into trouble sometimes. - this is a prime example.",1
"> No need to gate keep or insult him.  Ah, don't sweat it. It's the internet. Nice of you to speak up, though! Appreciated.",1
"It‚Äôs stuff like this that makes movie studios dumb down their story and explain everything. Actually watching the movie, you pick up on all those little clues and you have to think a little bit about why and how Batman was driven to this. I guess a lot of the general audience prefers ‚Äútell don‚Äôt show‚Äù because not many people seem to get Snyder‚Äôs world",1
">So, Batman being as trained as he is, wouldn't know how to incapacitate people without injuring them fatally and would leave bodies in his wake. Okaaaay.  I'd say it's in line with The Dark Knight Returns take on Batman (who in turn was inspired by golden age Batman), but really it's just the idea of someone doing what batman does in a real world setting that would result in some deaths. I mean you can knock out thugs all day long, but some of them won't ever get back up again.   >Just my thoughts on the matter. You do you. üëç  You as well! üëç",1
So the system in place to gather critics‚Äô rating doesn‚Äôt agree with the rating of your lord and savior and now you want to say the system is wrong...  And I should now take the word of someone who clearly is a fan of Snyder over the word of critics whose sole job is to watch movies (not just the one they like) with a critic eye. Oookay,1
"Yes, exactly. I don‚Äôt get why people force themselves to choose. I can like both chocolate AND vanilla. Why would that not apply here? Like, okay, some people genuinely didn‚Äôt like the DCEU, which is fine, I get it. But to not like DC simply because it isn‚Äôt Marvel and isn‚Äôt similar to Marvel is stupid to me.",1
"I really, really don't think he would have asked them to do that.  Everything I read about him says he is not the type of person who what put his friends in that position. Ben is still with WB, Gal is still WW they have no reason to start breaking rank now. All it does is draw attention. You talk about anonymous sources as if that is a legitimate way a multi billion dollar company would handle something like this. They don't have to attach an employee name to make a public announcement, if they snyder cut fans are as inconsequential as so many say then they have nothing to lose/fear in terms of p.r. and money. You bring up Affleck but he literally publicly announced he wasn't Batman anymore. It doesn't matter that there was gossip leading up to it, it's Hollywood, he literally addressed the issue and put it to bed. I'm not even as hopeful as some because I don't want to get let down again but them tweeting is not nothing and I highly doubt he asked them to do it. But I don't know he didn't anymore that you know he did. I am starting to believe that the movie is finished, and that it was far closer to completion than we were lead to believe. All you have to do is look at the timeline of events, plus with Momoa's recent comments about it's completion I'm starting to think if any vfx were left to edit they were minimal enough Zach was more than capable of handling it through his production company. And if that is the case there is absolutely no risk for them to release it on HBOmax. If anything it would be a huge draw and not just for snyder cut fans. One for people who are curious due to all the build up and the other would be comic book or JL fans because at the very least it's another live action JL movie. And what comic book/JL fan doesn't want that.",2
"WB doesn't deem it important enough to bother replying to. Should be clear by now but oh well.  Dude that hasn't worked for WB for years, is biased and has said shit that has contradicted stuff even Zack has said now and then. His word is gospel truth because it suits narrative you've made up inside your head.  You do you bud. Whatever feels nice. Hang on to it for however long you feel like. üëç",1
"I think you confused me with the other dude, I'm on your side lol",1
">Ah. a frequent response from someone who got their Batman history lesson from a YouTube video.  This sentence comes across as gate keeping and a little insulting to me. Fair enough if you didn't intend it to be either of those things.   The reason I believe it comes across that way is because  you dismiss the other person outright, by assuming a higher position based on your personal level of expertise with the source material.   >Look, you can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs the truth with some people, youtube and Wikipedia is their history lesson with so much left out and catered to preference that it‚Äôs nearly impossible to have a legit discussion. Pointing that out is hardly an insult, rather a reality check. I‚Äôm just not afraid to call it what it is.  I agree that not everyone has the same amount of knowledge in regards to the comics and a character's overall history. But I think it's important to be welcoming, and to try to educate someone through meaningful discussion. If the person becomes rude, and doubles down on their incorrect assumptions, then it's okay to move on as that person is not willing to adjust their world view when presented with new evidence or may just be a troll. As fans we need to be welcoming to each other and accepting of each others opinions about characters as well.",1
Uh..well my lord and savior is Jesus Christ.   Moviecritics don‚Äôt determine whether a film is good or bad. Initial reception doesn‚Äôt either.   Yeah I‚Äôm a fan. I‚Äôm also a fan of Spielberg because I think he makes good films...most of the time. Your point?   Here I‚Äôll throw a wrench in the mix; I thought Sucker Punch was bad.,1
"Agreed, I enjoy them both and feel fortunate too. There‚Äôs more to look forward to, more content, more flavors and less strain. As you said, it‚Äôs fair if someone doesn‚Äôt like one or the other for their particular merits, but the rivalry thing makes the most sense at a corporate level, I see no reason for a fan rivalry, especially as opposed to support from a fellow fan base who are the most likely to understand how it feels to be a fan and be excited about these hero movies.",1
"I believe he did ask them. People do things to get what they want.  >Anonymous sources  Those very sources kept saying Affleck was out for two years (which was the truth) but y'all kept being in denial. Something similar happening for snyder cut doesn't surprise me. You do you tho.  >Not hearing it from WB  They don't deem those to be significant enough to worth addressing I guess.  >Movie is complete  VFX team of that movie said work is needed on those but okay.  >No risk  But there is. If they caved in once, y'all would start spamming them with something else. Having him make the JL movies that were cancelled or releasing Ayer cut and so on. They'd know this works and double down on this shit. WB doesn't want to open that can of worms. No one in their right mind would. Furthermore it would clash with Ava's movie. They're looking forward, not backwards. They would also be criticized if it's better than the theatrical one.  They have no incentive to release it but people refuse to see it because they don't want it to be true.",1
"Oh how convenient, the person who actually worked on the film is less reliable about what happened than the unnamed source that parroted the same nonsense of last year.   Sure thing bud, it‚Äôs all in my head. Very fitting of you to deny facts that go against what you believe in and then lecture others for doing the exact same thing when they aren‚Äôt. üëçüèª",2
Haha ope! my bad....Sorry about that...it‚Äôs been quite a day..I‚Äôll delete my comment.,1
"I do see what you‚Äôre saying. I apologize for my out rightness about this. I‚Äôve had this discussion so many times that I tend to know whether they‚Äôre open minded or not based on how they say what they said.  But yes, sometimes the battle isn‚Äôt worth it.",1
"I've been tarred as ""just a Snyder fanboy"" a number of times, but think Sucker Punch is mediocre at best and have not seen 300, Dawn of the Dead or Watchmen.   I think people find it easier to suggest you're a rabid fanboy to discredit you rather than engaging with the points you've made which might force them to rethink the Reddit hugbox idea that Snyder is the worst thing to happen to movies.",1
You make a good point about Ava's movie. Releasing the cut and then demanding more movies would completely overshadow the current slate and this is a slate WB is proud of at the moment. Everything is going as planned for them for once and they cannot fuck this up for a cut.,0
"Decent people also don't take advantage of friendships, but you do you. Oh the irony of your thought process. So caving on this sets a bad precedent, but the whole reason JL was even changed was because they caved to social media pressure. But again, you do you. Other VFX artists have said it was close to completion, Momoa has implied it's  completed. Many have come out and said they have seen it.  If you look at the timeline and know even a little about how movies are made it's pretty obvious it would be alot more than an assembly cut. More than likely minimal vfx left to be done. But again you can believe w.e you wish. They have incentive to release as it shows good will towards fans and it would help to draw people to HBOmax. How do you know it was the same sources when they are anonymous? That's a weird leap. It's also weird to assume I didn't believe Ben was gone. I knew it as soon as I saw JL because I knew that wasn't what he signed up for. How do I know? Because he literally said the reason he choose to do Batman and it was because of snyders story.  You can belive as you wish just as I can. People like you are weird though, spend an inordinate amount of time on something you don't care about. Honestly it's fucking strange, I will never understand people like yourself. Who focuses on the things they hate? That's just counter productive",1
Your hypocrisy and lack of awareness is amusing. Keep it up dude. ü§ò,1
We all get caught up in arguments about things we are passionate about :),1
"Absolutely agreed.   I highly suggest 300, DofD, and Watchmen (directors cut) btw. All well done imo.",1
"Yep. They've had consistently good movies in terms of overall reception recently and they want to continue.  Not to forget that Ava already has been harassed on twitter, being name called.  They would throw more shit at her for something as simple as casting a Darkseid for her movie. Hell, they'll do it even if it doesn't get released.",1
"I'm not focusing on ""hate"", just giving my 2 cents.  The way you're ranting & raving and calling people names (whom you've never met and whose actions have no bearing on your life) make you sound unhinged and crazy tho. Seek some help dude.   I'm blocking you because unlike you, I don't have all the time to waste and my life doesn't revolve around a movie like yours seem to. Have fun talking to yourself freak.",1
Haha very true..,1
I know some people gave Sandberg a lot of critique for not getting Cavill for the cameo in Shazam. Can't imagine what they'd put Ava through.,1
"So how am I ranting and raving exactly? You addressed me, I refuted your points. End of story. I made it very clear that we have a difference of opinion, and I'm curious as to what names I called you. I mean you are the only one who has said anything insulting. Because I called you strange? People like you are strange, people who can't just let others enjoy things are very strange. You also seem very fragile. I wasn't talking to myself, I was talking to you after you inserted yourself into the thread and addressed me, but you do you. You sound like you are 12.",1
"Lol also you say you don't have all day but not even a minute passed after my comment and you responded. I think you do have all day, and that is very sad.",1
That stuff is ridiculous. He went out of his way to put Easter eggs for Snyder's DCEU when he didn't have to. To think he deliberately used a double while not showing a head over the actor is unbelievable.,1

"Do we know for sure if WB actually said that though, or could the people who wrote the article be bullshitting.",3
"To my point of view that WB has already screwed the dc universe in every single way And by that i mean all the cinematic universes we have from CW to DCEU to THE TITAN VERSE, this is getting missed up day by day and they just want the money üòë",2
People hate him because he ruined the DCEU.,0
Yup. His speech feels oddly relevant. Fiery and defiant. Doubters stick to your word. Faithful keep believing.,1
"Get out of here with your condescending tone.  I grew up on DC, lived and breathed it as a child. In fact I care so much about the franchise that I‚Äôd like to see the additional, higher quality content that is out there, being backed by THE PPL IN THE FILM, BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT IS BETTER.  By posting in a different subreddit, how is my voice going to be heard?? How can the messag get out there if only 5 sad f__ks see the post?   See, now by posting **here**.....some ppl might actually see it, and maybe they‚Äôll spread the thought around. Maybe the whole boycotting ‚Äúsubpar content and ideals‚Äù concept thing can get backed, and be administered to all the cash grab media being flung in our faces, all of the garbage quality items and abstracts we all encounter in our day to day lives.  Maybe unlike some limpdick bitches out there, I actually demand the best?   Hbu?",0
"WB almost never announces things directly to the public. They usually reveal information through media outlets, especially Deadline, but sometimes Variety and The Hollywood Reporter as well.",3
"No, WB didn't say anything. They said ""inside source""",3
He‚Äôs not though.....,2
As the other person said. The writer was citing their ‚Äòinside source‚Äô so it could be completely wrong,3
"So for all we know that Inside Source is possibly wrong? It might not mean anything, but when asked earlier If they should Give up hope, Zack replied ‚Äòdon‚Äôt‚Äô. Now we shouldn‚Äôt get ahead of ourselves, but maybe that‚Äôs a hint talks are going well",2
Outside of 300 all his movies he‚Äôs directed have been trash which is sad considering he‚Äôs had some amazing properties to work with,0
"He didn‚Äôt huh? Where‚Äôs our Batman, Where‚Äôs our Superman, Where‚Äôs our Cyborg? Where‚Äôs our movies. Should I go on.",0
"He did via bvs. It‚Äôs critical and financial performance kind of doomed his own plan and consequently, the dceu. I know a lot of people hear love it, which is fine, But many (along with myself) thought it was a hot mess. That‚Äôs his fault.",0
"Justin Kroll doesn't do bullshit. When he reported Pattinson as Batman and other outlets were running with he is on a final shortlist with Hoult he basically posted ""Shortlist my ass"" when Matt Reeves confirmed Rob https://twitter.com/krolljvar/status/1134475607775907840",3
It means Variety doesn't k ow shit and just said that to stir things up.,2
They haven‚Äôt been trash though,2
They are in a movie that you would very much enjoy. We call it the josstice league go watch it,3
Thank you. People acting like Kroll is unreliable when he literally has the best info out of any ‚Äúscoopers‚Äù,2
"And it pissed Zack off, which can work in his favour, as this sudden increase in photos is building up more hype",2
"All the articles today was free publicity to release the Snyder Cut. These outlets can‚Äôt help to publish more articles about to drive traffic and get clicks, and it only helps the cause.",2
"For anybody who doesn‚Äôt know, she just posted this on IG with caption saying ‚Äúhair cut‚Äù. Screentests are coming!!!",3
"Short haired Selina is best Selina, hopefully this is for screentests and hopefully we get to see costumes soon!",3
#MEOW,3
It‚Äôs so perfect. Does this haircut mean she‚Äôll be suiting up for screen tests/costume tests soon? To see what her and Pattinson look like in their suits on camera?,2
She is so fine.,3
She literally has a cat-like appearance. Nail d the casting. Bulls eye,3
Shit Yeah arkham city is gonna come to life in this movie.,2
I hope that Zoe has been training on saying *purrr*fect.,2
I hope that this is an indication that they're going with a Darwyn Cooke inspired look for Selina.,2
I prefer the long hair Selina. Still excited to see her take though.,1
Oh my God that‚Äôs perfect,2
This kitty‚Äôs got claws,1
Dig the haircut. Will go perfect with the classic silk dress.,1
so hot,1
She done put on some gains all kiiiiinds,1
"I have friends who were very upset about the casting. With Jared Leto, the worst has already happened. DC Cinematic Universe can't hurt me anymore.   I'm just happy they hired a good actress, I couldn't give less of a fuck about her race or politics.   At this point they could hire Tilda Swinton to play Bane and I would be on here saying give her a chance.   That's how shitty of an actor Jared Leto is.",1
She's pretty but she's not a Selina Kyle.,0
Still dont see the fit....like at all.,0
Still think it was a terrible cast...She looks like a homeless junkie in most her photos...,1
Hell  #YEAH,3
She‚Äôs looking pretty fit too.,2
"Yep, I think they‚Äôll be having screen tests soon.",2
Her kitty is probably nice also,0
Yes Darwyn Cooke‚Äôs Catwoman design is perfection: https://i.imgur.com/7LcsPYN.jpg,1
I beg to differ that's Selina bro,2
how? I mean I understand everyone has opinions and all but what about her could be possibly be so NOT Selena Kyle to you?,3
She‚Äôs literally SELINA KYLE,3
"I'm normally iffy on racebending main characters, but Selina's been black before, with Eartha Kitt. Even mixed race, if you count Halle.",2
"Dammit, who here let Brett Ratner in?",1
You're one sick puppy.,1
the fuck?,2
"Bruhhhhhh, GTFO!!!",2
"Look. I know releasing an actual black character would be better than ""re-skinning"" a white one but her being black as one of the reasons and no explanation just sounds plain racist.",2
"Yeah, I own a personal time machine :)",2
also i think Zoe is technically mixed race since both of her parents are mixed.,2
It's not she hasn't been black in a couple versions of the character anyway though.,2
*squeaks in MY MAN*,3
I wanna see an edit of Orm screaming ‚ÄúRIIIIIISE ATLANTIS‚Äù but with clicking and squeaking noises,3
This would have sounded great in IMAX.,3
"Me, a Snyder fan:     *Laughing intensely* Yeah, I'll concede, this is hilarious.     Oh my sides. Something's definitely Bleeding.",3
I think everyone should be able to agree this was a boneheaded idea on Snyder's part.  But I'm sure some Snyder fans will find some way to blame this on Joss Whedon or something...,3
Hahagahahahahahah I‚Äôm cryinn,2
Hahahaja,1
"I don't see why people are upset by this. Snyder also revealed that he had Dick Grayson in mind when asked about who the dead Robin was and also thought the Wayne Manor was long abandoned before Bruce even became Batman - these are headcanon ideas that Snyder was willing to allow other filmmakers to change it they so chose (Ayer changed the dead Robin to Jason and we already know Wan allowed the Atlanteans to talk underwater).  I personally dislike Snyder's ideas here, but they're easily dismissive in the long run. However, I do get personal pet peeves. I get really annoyed whenever someone talks in space without a helmet or comlink. It's just a pet peeve.",2
"Ok I am a huge Snyder fan, but even I know that this was a dumb ideaüòÇ",2
lm dying,1
"If Snyder made this movie, it woiod be all blood and gore, no story and would be a massive flop. Arthur would be a psycho killer.",1
Best sound VFX oscar comin,1
"Here comes WB's damage control spin to halt the Snyder cut. No way would Mr. Snyder make a movie with just dolphin like dialogue. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't want to listen to it either, hence his bubbles for the dialogue sequences.",0
"Maybe it would actually be good? Just a thought, lol.  I‚Äôm prepared for downvotes simply because apparently you can‚Äôt not like Aquaman in this sub which is simply hilarious.",0
Squeaks in *AAALRIGHT.*,3
Can u imagine that shit LOOL,2
"That, was good.",1
"I think it was one of those ideas he had, couldn't implement, and would realize it was stupid eventually. Good directors can have bad ideas, I'm a huge Snyder fan and I rag on Sucker Punch every chance I get.",3
"It makes sense to pretend they are talking in clicks and squeeks, and having it sound like English to the viewer. Why would underwater people who haven't had contact with the surface world speak a land-based language? It makes a lot of sense, it's just difficult to implement. James Wan said he doesn't want to do air bubbles every time since half his movie is underwater, so he came up with a good solution with the slight echo/reverb in the voice modulation.",2
Snyder is the GOAT. Should‚Äôve let him continue his work in DC. Guaranteed it was going to be very very very successful.   #RELEASETHESNYDERCUT  /s  Jokes aside... would want to see his JL cut. 100 percent couldn‚Äôt be worse than the TC.,1
"If he was directing a whole aquaman movie, I dont think he'd do that. It was just a scene or two",1
"Basically his plan was to create a new language to be spoken underwater.    Problem is that they already established Atlantean language many times in the comics and in the Young Justice Tv Show.  It would have been cool for him to spawn a new language.  But I think it would have been weird?  Could have sounded fine as a final product.  But it would suck for anyone making an entire Aquaman film, where he was just going to spend a small segment of time in Atlantis, but they had to be there for around an hour.",1
Stop using this as an excuse to act like Joss Whedon's work on JL wasn't awful. Those complaints are valid. Both this underwater clicks thing AND the horrible work Whedon did are valid complaints. One doesn't take away from the other.,1
Neither Man of Steel or BvS was gory.,0
"If WB is pushing back, they're doing it via trades. Not random posts on reddit.   Like I am annoyed about the articles too but no sense jumping at shadows",1
"Exactly this, it's just him playing with thoughts. Not a definite intend to implement. Morons.",0
Lmao an Aquaman movie where 90% of the dialogue sounds like this honestly sounds terrible.,3
"Definitely, good directors can have good and bad ideas, just like bad directors can have good and bad ideas. It's healthy to be able to recognize that, and I'm glad we can agree on this one. I don't like Snyder, but I still appreciate some things he brought to the table. The first flight scene from Man of Steel is great, for example. And he had a good eye for casting Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa, which someone else may very well have overlooked.",2
"You can certainly say in theory that they speak in clicks and squeaks. But in terms of what we actually hear on screen, they should be in English, because that's convenient.   The solution to this problem shouldn't be subtitling their clicks and squeaks, or creating an air bubble so it ""makes sense"". The solution is just to present it as is and trust the audience to understand why they're speaking English. We can suspend our disbelief.",3
"Actually, I‚Äôd disagree. Lower the cricket noise and do something differently obviously, but if you were to create a language spoken in the ocean while using subtitles...it would be as satisfying to me as how I always wanted the same thing for whenever aliens appear in a CBM.",0
"Yeah. Like I can't stand most of Joss' stuff (Even Avengers 1 which I loved at first hasn't aged well for me compared to the Russo stuff), but Firefly is and always will be a classic to me.",2
"Well yeah. They were gonna have a [Kryptonian language](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1709700/we-almost-got-to-see-russell-crowe-speak-kryptonian-in-man-of-steel) but Russell Crowe didn't wanna have to learn nonsense syllables. Personally, I love that extra mile in world-building. That's why Game of Thrones and LotR has resonated so well, because there's actual family trees, world maps, and synthetic languages to go along with the story. I love having a rhyme and reason for things; that's why I love Zack's approach to these mythic characters -- he answers the why, the what, and the how, which is fun for me.",2
"I'm not against conlangs. If ZS was able to create a nice sounding Atlantean language, then why not, but IMO he was super reaching in his logic. Wan had them speaking underwater, but the effects to the voices made them really stand out. A film where a ton of the dialogue is clicking and squeaking just sounds bad to me.",2
"Well, in his defense he did say he was still trying to work it out. It‚Äôs unfair to think it would have been literal clicks and squeaks. It also wouldn‚Äôt be the first time Zack‚Äôs not doing the greatest job of trying to explain something on Vero.",0

"So these pictures confirm that the scene and lines in the theatrical cut was originally intended to be between Vulko and Aquaman, not Mera and Aquaman. It also explains why Aquaman saying to Mera, ""Then I'm going to need something from you"" doesn't make any sense at all. Vulko had access to armor and the trident, not her.",2

"""Oh? You're approaching me?""",2
This is not a flash back scene. Arthur is wearing the same ripped jeans he had on when dodging Steppenwolf's axe and other scenes from that underwater battle. This is the scene which was replaced by Arthur and Mera talking inside the bubble. Serving the same purpose to give Arthur the suit and quindent and get him on his way to help the League. Looks like WB didn't want to stick with whatever Snyder did for the Atlanteans and moved on to James Wan's interpretation.,1
Can we just take a moment to mention that ***THOSE SURE AS SHIT LOOK LIKE COMPLETED EFFECTS TO ME?!??!?!!?***  Guess all the haters saying it‚Äôs unwatchable can fuck off,2
#ReleaseTheSnyderCut  So much character development cut out...,1
"I never understood why they needed them to speak in a bubble of air, I could understand if they needed to talk to a human, but it just comes across as a bit weird when it's two atlanteans",2
Is just me or the effects look finished?,1
"If they ever released any type of ""Snyder cut"" I'd be absolutely fine with it all being in black and white.",1

Justice League: Colorized by Ted Turner.,3
I hated those things too but this still has the water talk bubble so it would be retconned either way,3
Probably mostly for time and not wanting too many important characters introduced.,1
I was looking for this,1
Three. He shared a pic of outside the bubble as well,3
I would watch this thing in black and white all day,1
When (not if) that happens I swear I‚Äôll shit myself.,1
Could be especially with Johns having a deep interest in Aquaman movie's continuity.  They could have done the bubble thing twice...... we just gonna have to wait.,1
This air bubble is wayyyy cooler with typical Snyder angles.,1
Bubbles are to talk in private. Explained in Aquaman.,3
Please take your hating on Snyder anywhere else. Thanks.,2
Good luck man. This sub had become a full blown Snyder echo chamber. Anything contrary to him is down voted to hell.,1
THE LIGHT BELONG TO ME!!!!,2
Here's confirmation that he got the trident and armor from Vulko! https://twitter.com/Spn_Darkness/status/1199413106872651776?s=19,3
The only thing I don't understand is didn't he already have the trident in that naval surveillance video in Batman v. Superman?,2
Should be working now. Could you try again?,2
"Exactly.  I get Snyder‚Äôs rationale and I get Wan‚Äôs rationale.  Preferences aside, clearly it makes things logistically easier if they can just talk underwater instead of making air bubbles every time.",1
"The bubble talking was a way to ensure privacy.  Don't they even do it in Aquaman? I've only seen it once so far, when it came out, so can't remember for sure, but feel like when he gets to the city, they meet Vulko in that old shack place with air in it, right?",2
The water y‚Äôall bubble wasn‚Äôt in the theatrical cut. It was a reshoot by James Wan.,1
"No. It has been stated that they cut down the movie to 2 hours to ensure more seats and more showings, even if they received a minimal amount of money, just so they could fill up their yearly bonuses.",3
"Wow, you're right. Another day, and we're one day closer to the SnyderCut.",3
I really loathe that jug headed moron. Glad he's not involved with the DC movies anymore. His face is so punchable.,2
"It looks cooler here than it did in JL, but what's the point? They're atlanteans, they would know how to talk underwater",2
Boom. Context. Thank you Tim.,3
Snyder‚Äôs never alludes that it‚Äôs for privacy. And in Aquaman they use the air pocket as a safe house since only highborns can breathe both air and water. It‚Äôs not the same.,0
That's just plain wrong. Snyder came out and said he thought atlanteans would speak in squeaks and clicks. And he thought speaking underwater doesn't make sense.,0
This is a message board. Not an echo chamber. Thanks.,1
This isnt a Zack Snyder sub. It's a DC cinematic sub. People can have a different opinion. And some people are of the opinion that the speech bubbles were dumb. Wan showed that you can have an entire movie without needing them. But Snyder thought that speaking underwater didn't make sense so he made them speak in bubbles.  It was a bad idea.,1
"Yup, God forbid somebody points out thinks they don't like about him, you'd get called a ""marvel kid"" lol as if being a fan of Marvel comics somehow is a bad thing.",0
"Right, i imagine this is after the Steppenwolf battle underwater and then some few scenes happen and then he had his big entrance at the tunnel when the water breaks out, where he has his armor and trident, did we even had context for that in the theatrical cut?",1
"I thought that was *a* Trident, not the",3
Sure did.,2
It's probably a flashback. Or just a plot hole. We'll see.,1
"I guess we'll see. I think that the League was originally supposed to have a larger role (or more extended cameos) in early discussions of BvS. Arthur was also originally supposed to have the Aquaman armor in JL, but Wan wanted to use it as a plot point in his film. Given all of this, it wouldn't surprise me if there was a continuity error with Aquaman's duds.",1
"OK yea, I remember him saying that before.  Basically  they didn't think Atlanteans would be speaking a human style of language, but they never got around to creating it.  So they just moved forward and James Wan did his thing.",3
"Yes, they do, as a mean of keeping their convo private since only a select number of ‚ÄúHigh Atlanteans‚Äù can even breathe air oxygen.   I‚Äôve never gotten the hubbub about Snyder using air bubbles.  Yes he confirmed today he used them as his personal preference but there‚Äôs nothing about it that actually contradicts anything in Aquaman.",3
"Yea for sure, I mean, this chop job was likely a part of shrinking the story down a bunch.",3
I agree on the punchability.   But he will still work on DC films. As a producer. So directors will have to know what theyre getting into with him. Or make sure he isnt the main shot caller producer.   Majorly he just isnt a boss in the studio.,2
Bubbles are for privacy. As explained in Aquaman.,3
Extra layer of precaution.  I honestly don't have a fight in this one though.  If I'm wrong it's fine.    I don't care if the hadn't figured the logistics of it all or not yet.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWBHJ8WCIIE,2
Yea. In Aquaman they were explained though. Snyder dis it first with a purpose he couldn‚Äôt realize so he just went with the bubble. And honestly I think this looks fucking bomb. The one in josstice league looks like shit.,2
"Yeah but Snyder Cut haters on the whole just sound like dumbasses at this point.    It‚Äôs like what the hell ar wyou guys even fighting for at this point? Not letting others see an alternate cut they want to see? I mean, Jesus.",1
"This IS a Zack Snyder sub.   That's all that people talk about on here. ""Snyder posted this! Snyder said this!""  I feel like I follow his personal social media by being on here.",0
Then wouldn't that be a plot hole? Granted we don't have the full context and it's nothing compared to the plot holes and inconsistencies in the theatrical cut lol,2
"Maybe it‚Äôs just Vulko‚Äôs?   And on the costumes, it‚Äôs clear that whatever original plans may have been, Snyder chose to go with non-official/final costumes for all three new characters in JL (Flash/Aquaman/Cyborg) to leave it open for the solo film directors to go with the costume designs they wanted as the characters‚Äô ‚Äúofficial‚Äù costumes.",1
The hubbub is that if we have gotten more of Snyder's underwater scenes as we were supposed to it would have contradicted for sure,1
"And what‚Äôs funny is there‚Äôs almost no story left.  I mean there‚Äôs obviously PLOT, but literally nothing that has any life to it happens in the film and the whole thing ends up being pretty much a pointless movie.",1
Did Aquaman explain it? I thought they just skipped over it.,1
"So all you want to hear is positive things about Snyder? Welcome to Snyder_Circle_Jerk, where if you say anything about Snyder you considered a hater and get downvoted to hell.",0
"I mean, we dunno what context it was in Vulko can just say he's been holding on to it for him, or he left it somewhere",2
Well from Aquaman Movie he had a trident as a kid for training purposes. So maybe he always had trident somewhere but not the armour for sure.,1
Explained it when they go to the boat.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWBHJ8WCIIE,2
"I mean, that's specifically because the Atlantean guard are after them, it's not the same kind of air bubble that's used in JL, Wan's comments on the air bubbles on twitter:  >""Fret not, no 'air bubbles for dialogue' in my underwater world  implies that the way Snyder used them are not the same way that Wan was using the air pockets, so I don't think Snyder specifically used them for privacy, but just for dialogue, but we don't have snyders word on the feature, so I can't really say one way or another.   EDIT: I've just seen Snyder's comments on it from a post in this thread, Snyder didn't use it for privacy, he used it so the atlanteans could speak English as he doesn't like talking underwater anyway and feels the atlanteans would have a different language that's not like human ones anyway.   I still feel it was completely unnecessary though",2
Yea someone posted Zack;s quote.   And I applaud his idea for it.  He just didn't think they should be speaking normal and human underwater and that Atlanteans should communicate like fish or aliens.  They created the bubbles because they didmt figure it out for JL and wanted it to be left open for the future in case someone figured it out.,2
">And I applaud his idea for it.  Honestly, I feel its mostly unnecessary, Snyder's precedent if carried forward would mean mera and other atlanteans would have to do that every time they speak to a non-atlantean.  >He just didn't think they should be speaking normal and human underwater and that Atlanteans should communicate like fish or aliens.  I mean, they used to be humans anyway, they'd have the same way of communicating, but I guess it's creative, but again, feels mostly unnecessary.",1
Unnecessary. Cuz no one would care. But he cared. And wanted it to be different. So I applaud it.   Looks slick here. So cant be mad about it. Can totally be mad about it in Josstice league,1
"But why be different when it adds no benefit, it's just clunky and gets in the way, the comics haven't ever really had a need for it.   >Can totally be mad about it in Josstice league   Why though? It ultimately did the same thing, made the scene clunky and awkward",2
I mean. We dont know the context zack filmed this in.   And I throw Josstice league under the bus because it was lamely filmed. Doesnt look very good as well as being clunky.   Now I agree. Just go with talking underwater but he has very little underwater scenes and this one looks to be really pretty overall.,2
">I mean. We dont know the context zack filmed this in.   This scene? Sure, but I was referring to the scene with him and Mera after steppenwolf took the atlantean mother box, it just makes the scene look awkward and clunky, Mera had to make a giant bubble just so they could talk.   >Doesnt look very good as well as being clunky.   I really doubt this scene would have looked all that different in the TC anyway.",1
I mean. That whole Mera scene could have been reshoots. Whos to say there was just multiple bubbles popping open?  And honestly it wouldnt bother me one bit if everytime an atlantean spoke one of the mystics opened a bubble for me.   As long as I see the film,1
"Why would whedon carry over the bubble thing when it's going to cost money in new vfx for a small scene, it's likely a Snyder scene and they kept it because they didn't need to reshoot it",1
"I know for a fact a great deal of it was not Snyder in the first place.  You can also see when the background switches to be more blurry when it jumps to green screen in the middle of their bubble talk.  There could be two different bubble scenes......  But it's looking like it was reshoots, and maybe when we get the Snydercut, we don't see something like that at all.",1

What article,2
Why are you putting hash tags on reddit? Lmao,3
It's on his Vero account he barely does anything on twitter anymore,3
It‚Äôs an app called ‚ÄúVero‚Äù.,1
"Hey, I behave like an animal only during weekends, don‚Äôt assume things :(  The #FuckVariety hashtag is something a couple of fans are doing dude. I don‚Äôt think that can compare to 6 years of basically cyberbulling Snyder out of the DCEU.",3

Apart from retweeting,3
Oh! Thank you both I've never heard of that one before. Much appreciated!,1
Nobody bullied anyone more than Snyder fanatics harassing DC execs on twitter throughout.  Forget this shit cut. He was given all the chances multiple times and he screwed it up.  Now he can stay in his hole Vero.,1
"And I tought the whole ""Warner wants Michael B Jordan as the next Superman"" was just some baseless rumor  Unless its fake news",2
"anytime, yeah I don't haven't so I don't know all that much about it either I just see all the stuff he posts on it on here or twitter",1
"Awww, arent you precious.",0
I think they listened to his pitch and it was blown out of proportion.,2
I'd much rather see him as Icon,1
I've been saying this since 2017. Henry Cavill grew a moustache and began work on another film. Affleck gained fat. Ezra was working on another film. These aren't the actions of people who believe they are coming back for reshoots. It's not hard. It literally makes less sense to believe there wasn't an alternate cut. He had more than enough time. The actors were clearly finished filming and in the past Snyder has had a quick turn around for filming.,3
The only thing I've read and it came from Zack himself on Vero is that he said he didn't get to film Harry Lennixs Martian Manhunter scene,3
The only thing Snyder didn‚Äôt shoot was the Lennix part of the MM cameo.,3
Jay's been a beacon of hope during this whole fiasco. Spitting facts and truths,3
Jay needs to be registered as a lethal weapon. The words he has for haters are killer.,3
Well no shit they didnt plan any reshoots. Why did Henry decide  to grow a moustache,3
"Trades: Our ""insiders"" will block out the sun.  Jay Oliva: Then we shall fight in the shade!",3
No no no no no If it comes from variety it is LAW. Fuck what the actual filmmaker says.,3
People still read variety?,1
Pickups are considered reshoots and Zack himself has said that he needed to finish the Martian Manhunter scene in LA.,3
Jay has a knack for completely destroying these doubters/haters.,2
Who actually believes Variety? üòÇ,2
Insiders will tow the company line. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre insiders.,2
All major blockbusters have reshoots or some form of pick-up shots so I highly doubt that.,0
Are we ever going to let this go?,0
Best argument for the Snyder cut I have read,3
"This makes too much sense, stop it lol",2
> Affleck gained fat.  CULTIVATED MASS. Get it right.,2
Henry Cavil also gave his MI6 character the mustache himself.,2
This!!!,1
I‚Äôm wondering whether WB told Zack he couldn‚Äôt announce a wrap on production until he‚Äôd done the now famous screening of his assembly cut?,1
"Wait, so that means Zack shot everything he needed before Joss came on board? Thus Synder Cut is all directed by Zack?   Or is the understanding that Zack shot what he could, then Joss came on board to shoot what Zack planned for, THEN Joss added reshoots to change the movie? So in terms of Snyder Cut, it's Zack's plans but Joss directed a certain amount?",1
"Because that was supposed to happen during principal photography but Lennix was busy with his schedule, so Jay didn't have to storyboard the scene because Zack already did it.",3
Does anyone know what the deal with the scene was?  It had to have been after the steppenwolf fight right?  It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôd reveal manhunter and then not include him in the fight.,2
Every big movie has reshoots,0
"But we all know the context of how those words get used now. Reshoots definitely have a bad reputation, while pick ups are things that they typically could not film at the time, or werent pertinent like insert shots.",2
"As someone else mentioned earlier in this comments section, there is a significant difference between reshoots and mere pickups.",2
Reshoots and pickups are different things entirely. A pickup could just be a simple scene involving one actor like the scene with Swanwick turning into Martian Manhunter.,2
"He‚Äôs worked on the film and is a frequent collaborator with Zack Snyder. I‚Äôd say he may not be impartial, but he is definitely a reliable source for the current state of the film. There should be no doubt that he speaks to Zack or has a direct line to Zack.",3
"Again... If you want to trust variety, cool. That article is ridiculous and is just telling us utter crap we already know of. But you'd rather favour those than a guy who worked on the project and most likely provided Zack with some official story boards.. mmkay then.",2
We? never! You can leave tho,2
"ü§£üò≠ You're the boss, boss.",1
"He did announce it though. In October 2016 filming had finished. Picture lock (meaning edited into a timeline which won't be further edited and past the ""assembly cut"" stage) was established as being done in January 2017 at the time. What he screened wasn't his assembly cut. He screened it in January. He was past that stage by then which is why Kevin Smith's insider was able to make claims about the cut.   If you were following Zack's posts you didn't have to guess. This has been the most infuriating thing about this. The willful ignorance. It was never mythical. It was never hard to get evidence. It was never hard to use common sense but because it was Snyder people jumped through hoops and performed all sorts of mental gymnastics to believe literally anything but the truth. Imagine hating someone so much you willfully engage in deception and promote it as fact. You take the word of some ""inside source"" which remains nameless over Zack Snyder himself? I'm not exaggerating when I say some of the worst behaviour in our society was on display here.",2
"No, joss came in for reshoots and restructure. Zack shot his version.",2
And honestly all that needs to be done is an hours worth of getting a piece of green cardboard set up as a background and film Lennox reacting or looking pensive.  Just composite whatever background plate was surely shot during production.,3
"The Justice League didn't show up in the Doomsday fight despite being teased. I think the same thing would've happened here, teasing us Martian Manhunter for a sequel. He seems to be taking care of Lois which probably would be before he came back to life. After all, what this tells us is that Superman has an ally in the government, we don't have to assume he can fight",2
"Knowing Zack, it's not entirely impossible. Like, let's not forget that the JL teaser in BvS was shoehorned right in the middle of the Doomsday fight (or a bit before, I don't remember too clearly). So it's not entirely out there that Zack would squeeze in little things like John J'onzz revelation in the middle of the film, in a probably unrelated scene.",1
Ah ok I didn‚Äôt realise picture lock had been called on that date. I‚Äôd love (but at the same time be disappointed) to see a documentary on the JL Debacle in the vain of Superman Lives and documentaries made on The Donner Cut etc in years to come to highlight what a mess this all was and how Snyder and the community fought for what was right,1
"That could be an interesting take, focus more on his telepathy and intangability -- more of a spy than a fighter.",1
It was just before the actual Batman/Superman fight.,2
That patented Apokoliptian sass,3
A pipe dream which a million will be smoking in less than a year from now,3
"People here saying we should believe the media and an ""insider"" (Let's not forget that these ""insiders"" have nearly always been wrong about Snyder Cut stuff) over someone who actually worked on the movie, knows Zack, and has been a part of the last few weeks' tremendous surge in support from the cast.  Alright I guess I should've believe CNN that *Joker* was gonna cause mass violence.",3
I mean...  Calling the Snyder Cut a pipe dream isn‚Äôt the same as calling the idea of WB releasing the SC a pipe dream.   Sounds like WB brass is perfectly fine with not releasing it right now.,2
TIL that a WB insider thinks a lot of high profile professionals in the film industry have a pipe dream about the Snydercut. LOL,3
"If we're in ""fuck the trades, they're wrong"" mode then I guess every casting in The Batman is false",2
"Variety isnt clickbait tabloid shit, their sources actually are sources. Tbh Im more inclined to believe that Variety has sources who know more about whats going on than Ray Porter who as far as I can tell from IMDB mostly works as an extra.",2
variety doesn't print bullshit articles. They clear have high up sources and Justin Kroll is not going to pull shit out of his ass.,3
So was he supposed to be Darkseid for all of the movies or just a place holder until they got a bigger actor for a later movie.,1
If pictures posted by Zack meant it was coming out it would‚Äôve been released long ago.,2
Bus dine thotiana üòå,1
How can one still show support for the Synder Cut,1
"Its amazing to me that there is a film that was meant to be the cornerstone of a franchise, that seems to be liked more by the people that worked on it than the theatrical release just sitting in a shelf somewhere.  Seriously what does WB have to loose, it certainly isn‚Äôt money, this thing will make another 650 some odd million dollars at least, who wants the turn that down.",1
"I trust Variety much more than I trust Ray Porter, that‚Äôs for sure.",0
Why is this a post?,0
"You mean after CNN reported that the FBI was warning of possible violence, right?  https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/us/joker-movie-security-threat/index.html  > (CNN)The FBI and Department of Homeland Security are warning law enforcement ahead of the opening weekend of the movie ""Joker"" after a number of threats were posted online calling for mass shootings at showings of the movie.  >In a Joint Intelligence Bulletin shared with police this week and obtained by CNN, federal authorities write that the FBI has no information leading to ""specific or credible threats to particular locations or venues,"" but note that the FBI has received tips of threats posted on social media since at least May.",2
"And last year WB‚Äôs supposed statements were that ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù. Look how that turned out.  WB is a reactionary studio, it‚Äôs just a matter of time.",1
"Variety is wrong in this case, not trades in general. Don‚Äôt simplify things.   Oh and The Batman‚Äôs castings weren‚Äôt reported via ‚Äúan insider of a source‚Äù, they were first reported normally and then *confirmed by the director.*",1
"Well, the movie storyboarder Jay Oliva just confirmed Snyder didn‚Äôt need to do any reshoots, as he shot and filmed everything he needed to do. Variety said the film ‚Äúneeded reshoots‚Äù.  I guess this is what happens when your ‚Äúsource is a source‚Äù, a crappy one.   And let‚Äôs not pretend Snyder never casted minor celebs as major roles.",1
Snyder thought he was good enough for the role so why does it matter what his other roles are? Are you even listening to yourself!?,1
People said the same thing about Hollywood Reporter. Then all of a sudden Hollywood Reporter that a joker sequel was in the works and they were then proven wrong. Then everyone started making fun of The Hollywood Reporter. These trade Publications as acclaimed and prestigious and high-ranking as they are can still make mistakes. No one is infallible. It's all a matter of just Rising back up and not making stupid mistakes again.,3
"I have yet to see a single one of these sources state any plausible reason for Gal and Ben's supportive tweets a week ago, if the Snyder Director Cut is never ever to be released.   What would they possibly have to gain by tweeting that after 2 years, having said absolutely nothing about it and toeing the WB party line?  If they can answer me that, I might be willing to listen. But at the moment, I strongly suspect that they're full of shit.",1
"Ah yes, the sources that are so high up they even trascended the concept of names.",0
That I don‚Äôt know. Maybe it was an Avengers1 Thanos case.   Or maybe just Snyder being Snyder and casting smaller people for big roles. (Look how it turned out for Momoa and Gadot tho!),2
"One would hope Snyder wasnt actually planning on having a guy whose biggest credit seems to be ""Lazlo"" on one episode of Modern Family portray the biggest baddie in the whole DC universe..",0
At what point have I said ‚ÄúSnyder posted this so it means it‚Äôs coming out‚Äù?    I simply said this was both after Variety released the statement of something not existing *and* Snyder posting very finished pictures of that apparently nonexistent something.,2
"Except it wasn't until recently that he started posting actual photos. Not storyboards, scenes with completed VFX and everything. That's what's different.",1
You can use the hashtag on social media üòä Like Twitter or IG.,1
"You do you. I trust someone who actually worked on the film more than ‚Äúconveniently unnamed inside source from WB #520‚Äù, that‚Äôs for sure.",3
üòÇ   We‚Äôve known for a while it‚Äôs real and you insist on believing a site desperately trying to get clicks and reads.,2
"You trust a celebrity media gossip outlet, than a dude who actually took part in said production.. what in the fuck is wrong with you..",0
"Why is he still a ""thing"" ? Most likely he'll never be the canon Darkseid.",0
Kroll‚Äôs sources within the DC side of WB are clearly better than THRs though. He‚Äôs basically been a mouthpiece for WB recently as he broke all the casting news for The Batman.,1
they tweeted because their friend asked them to,2
...you don‚Äôt keep sources if they get fired for going on the record with leaks.  How on earth is the concept of anonymous sources something that needs to be explained?,3
"No one names their sources. If they did, said source would be fired for leaking information.",2
"Do dummies who say these sort of things, whether it's movie scoops or politics, not understand how journalism works and why wouldn't want to out an insider source?",2
That's how journalism works.,2
"Oh god, are you really comparing Gadot - who had 4 Fast & Furious films under her belt as well as some other stuff - and Momoa - coming off of one of the biggest TV shows of all time and had been getting steady gigs for about 15 years - to a guy that in the last 7 years have done a total of 5 episodes across 4 different shows?  Ray Porter isn‚Äôt just small. He‚Äôs insignificant.",2
I fail to see how‚Äôs that a criteria.,1
Yea Zack has made pretty poor casting choices with lesser known actors like momoa and cavill,0
"Variety said that it releasing was a pipe dream, not that its existence was a pipe dream.  You‚Äôre having a full blown breakdown because you didn‚Äôt even read a quote correctly.  The Snyder cut can exist and WB can also be 100% sure they‚Äôre not releasing it. Both can be true. Calm down.",3
"It was more of a response to Rays comment. Zack releasing pics doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a pipe dream. He can post all the pics he wants, until WB changes their minds it won‚Äôt amount to squat.",0
Which probably means nothing more than his contract or NDA or whatever expired and he‚Äôs allowed to do stuff like that now.,1
"If I was an actor and the only work I‚Äôd done since 2012 was five TV episodes, I‚Äôd try to get attention any way I can, too.  He has zero knowledge about whether or not it‚Äôll get released.",0
So you trust some dude over a legitimate trade site that quoted actual exec's who greenlight these projects?,0
"It was a footnote in an article about the overall direction of DC, the headline said nothing about Snyder Cut. How was it desperately trying to get clicks?  If this article was word for word the same except for the blurb about the Snyder cut, you‚Äôd be championing Variety‚Äôs credentials as proof of its truth.  You‚Äôre humiliating yourself.",2
"I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt real. I‚Äôm saying this guy doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll get released or not, and its potential release is what Variety referred to as a ‚Äúpipe dream‚Äù.   And something tells me Ray Porter is much more desperate for clicks than Variety is.",0
"Should we ask the craft services guys from the JL shoot if it‚Äôs going to get released? After all, they took part of the production, so they must know.   Also, thanks for showing some civility, the SC stans are really showing their true colors tonight.",2
Still doesn't change the fact that he and his company variety have been wrong on numerous things before. It again we don't know The Insider he's talk to. The Insider could just be some low-level schmuck was just telling him information discussions that have been had. Plus also a lot of information that Crowell was talking about in his article today or things that a we already know or B things we had known way before or C things that he clearly didn't even bother to mention like for example Shazam and Black Adam and barely even mentioning Wonder Woman 1984. Has a lot of information that had been changed since then and he didn't even bother to mention those things. Plus JJ Abrams also has confirmed that they haven't had discussions about Superman yet but he goes and says that they are talking about Superman. So this guy's either getting very mixed information or he's talking about all the information that was given to him prior to his articles release.,3
Are you for real?!. 75% of that stuff is not only rumour but the same 'rumour' Shat out to us earlier on in the year..,1
"Earth is full of things that may never be explained.  One of these being, why WB releases statements via namelss anonymous sources that will turn out to be wrong the second a person who actually worked on it sets the record straight.",0
"Because it's a fucking copout that needs to go away. If WB has something they want the Snyder fans to know. It will be apparent. The only thing a ""source"" is good for is spinning a convenient narrative.",0
Then find better sources already. If the informations these unnamed individuals provide keep being debunked by actually named people something is clearly wrong.,0
"This isn't a government conspiracy. This won't get someone killed or harmed. It's a movie. And when every fact is against the ""insider"", then yeah. They need some basis to stand on. Burden of proof is on them.",0
You're right. Even marvel knew better and made sure to cast A list actors like Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans for their flagship characters...oh wait,0
And this contradicts what I said because...?,0
"You don‚Äôt see how having a proven, respected actor with box office draw is a criteria for playing the major protagonist in the entire DC universe? There‚Äôs a reason Josh Brolin played Thanos and not some random guy nobody heard of who appeared in one episode of Scubs.",0
Lesser known? You're comparing Ray Porter to Momoa and Cavill? Momoa was featured in a very memorable role in the biggest show of all time and was one of the most recognizable people in the world when he was cast. Henry Cavill was a rising TV star who'd made the shortlist to play James Bond. Who is Ray Porter?,1
" I‚Äôm actually pretty chill right now, so Im kinda worried of whatever you read.  (If I‚Äôm not having a breakdown but a stranger online is telling me I am, what should I say...?)  I‚Äôll agree on one thing: yes, the Snyder Cut can indeed exist. As it *does,* as it‚Äôs been confirmed multiple times already by people who worked on the film. That has stooped being a debate a long time ago. Wanna know what else happened a long time ago? A fella named Bob Fritz wrote an article about the ‚ÄúWB insider that was confused about this fabled cut that doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù, citing things like ‚Äúunfinished score and effects‚Äù.   Let‚Äôs just politely say that article isn‚Äôt exactly looked back as the magnum opus of accuracy or honesty these days.",1
"Objectively speaking, it has been confirmed to either exist, be mostly completed or both by people who worked on the film. It‚Äôs not a pipe dream and I‚Äôm tired of people who pretend it is.  Mark Hughes said it best in his article:   > It‚Äôs also worth noting that there was indeed a sustained campaign to convince everyone that no Snyder Cut exists, with some people intentionally spreading false information to mislead the press and public, while others spread the false information because they were misled by their bosses or sources and had no other evidence at the time to convince them otherwise.  Snyder posting completed VFX pics in admist of all the ‚Äúit‚Äôs an unfinished pipe dream‚Äù nonsense is simply sending a message.",1
"Nope. WB still legally owns the footage, hence why Snyder can‚Äôt just distribute it. And hence why he still posts in the copyright-free B&W.",1
"The first part of that comment is just needlessly meanspirited and childishly cynical. Of course, a person who‚Äôs not an A-lister must be doing everything he does for attention. Mature.  And I‚Äôm not really certain you have the telepathic abilities to know what he does and doesn‚Äôt know.  All I said is that this is a guy who actually worked on the film vs one ‚Äúinside source‚Äù boi.",2
"This. No one knew who he was and now he has bunch of fans riding him online, giving him attention and so on.  New Gods is in works so he might also be trying to get a gig there through this. Which obviously don't seem like something that's gonna happen normally.",2
What Execs?,1
"> some dude  Whom has a name, a carrier, a role in the Snyder Cut and has actually worked on it.  > a legitimate trade site  That has gotten stuff wrong before, whose WB declined to comment on and whose mysterious nameless insider is probably full of crap.  You sure you know which one of the two respectively falls into ‚Äúsome dude‚Äù and ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù?",2
Where's the quote?,1
"I don‚Äôt really think you can know what happens in hypothetical futures there bub. SC or not those would still be the usual ‚Äúrumors from a source‚Äù that WB decided to comment on. Variety being a ‚Äúmajor trade‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt change that, HP got wrong the whole Joker 2 thing.   Also, woah there with the ‚Äúhumiliation‚Äù. Maybe they‚Äôre not into that stuff.",1
You haven‚Äôt read much of Variety if you don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre desperate.,2
"Goodness, I remember when I used to trust the media this much.",1
"You're welcome it's the least I could do for someone that lacks any questioning when believing everything they hear from media gossip outlets.   The people who hate Snyder are really showing their true colours, also.",0
This man gets it!,1
"If you don't understand the reasoning and need for anonymous sources, then you don't understand anything about journalism.",3
>This isn't a government conspiracy. This won't get someone killed or harmed.  Right. Just fired and blacklisted for leaking studio information. Protection of sources in journalism has literally been a thing as long as journalism has been around.,2
"Okay, let's say that they name the source as John Doe. What's gonna happen is that John gets fired from WB for leaking stuff to journalists before the studio is ready to talk about it officially. After John gets fired, the journalist will not get any info from his/her other sources at any studio because all of them have seen what happened with John.  Do you still think it's a good idea to name your sources in the article?",2
">	This won‚Äôt get someone killed or harmed. It‚Äôs a movie.   Yeah, it‚Äôll only cost them their job.",2
"Funny, have I said they need to cast A list actors?  Nevertheless, Chris Hemsworth had Star Trek, two other films and 192 episodes of *Home and Away* under his belt.   Chris Evans had a decade of films behind him, including CBMs such as two Fantastic Four films, Scott Pilgrim, and The Losers.   Neither are comparable to Porter and his 5 episodes in the last 7 years.",0
"People have to start somewhere dude. Maybe money isn‚Äôt Zack Snyder‚Äôs main concern, unlike many people at Hollywood? The Russos deemed Brolin to be apt for Thanos, Snyder deemed Porter apt for Darkseid. I don‚Äôt see the complication.   Snyder is known for casting relatively small roles into big ones, which so far has resulted in success. What you‚Äôre criticizing here is not the casting decision, you‚Äôre criticizing the choice of not doing something Marvel would.",0
"The difference between mostly complete and actually complete can be huge. Hell, even if it was 100% done and ready for release, WB could still say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and sit on it forever.",2
"How would an actor with a cut role have a better idea on the studio plan to release it than...someone who works at the studio?  They‚Äôre not calling this actor with updates, dude. And if a source HAD to be named to be considered legit we would never have a source or rumor for any comic book movie again. This stance you‚Äôre taking on anonymous sources not counting in this one case out of hundreds makes me genuinely concerned about your mental health.",2
Yikes. I don‚Äôt want to know what happened to you to seriously think people are that superficial.,0
hey whatever floats your boat my man. And next year around this time when theres no snyder cut who are you going to blame then?,2
Variety is the NPR of movie news and doesn‚Äôt sacrifice literally decades of journalistic goodwill for clickbait.  I‚Äôm sorry that it doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative. You need psychiatric help if you‚Äôre this disconnected from reality.,2
And you haven‚Äôt looked up Ray Porter if you don‚Äôt think he is too.,2
"Funnily enough, not once have I mentioned that I actually trust the media.   I just said I trust this particular trade more than I trust this particular individual, regarding this very particular piece of information.",1
Thanks dude =),1
You got it dude.,1
I understand that 90% of what comes from journalists is misinformation and lies. I know enough.,0
"I'm saying the burden of proof is on the ""insider"". Not the journalist. It's not the journalist's fault that they can't call a source on BS and have to report it. Also, that doesn't apply here. The ""insider"" didn't announce anything, he did the opposite. He said nothing of substance. He wouldn't get fired for saying ""we're not doing anything"". We can plainly see they're not doing anything.  Y'all are taking this way too far.",0
"What I'm saying is the ""insiders"" shouldn't demand to be anonymous when they're trying to make claims every known fact is against. Unless, again, their life or safety is in danger.",0
"Goodness, never seen so much salt directed towards one person.",0
"Oh, sure thing they could. Absolutely.  I‚Äôll let Ian Malcolm deliver my thoughts on that:  https://youtu.be/9nazm3_OXac",1
"Someone who works at the studio, right. I‚Äôm sure the individuals that last year spread voices on how ‚Äúthe VFX weren‚Äôt done‚Äù, ‚Äúthe score is incomplete‚Äù, ‚Äúthe fabled cut doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù too worked at WB. So did Jay Oliva, Junkie XL and the  JL VFX artists, why is the word of named people now less valid than the nameless sources on this we should absolutely trust..?  I don‚Äôt have anything against anonymous resources. I have something against studios that refuse to release statements but instead let nameless sources create narratives in an attempt to shut down a group, which hasn‚Äôt worked last year and it won‚Äôt magically work now, or he next one.  Also, please stop using words like ‚Äúmental health‚Äù when talking about movies of all things. If this is too mentally stressful for you, you should take a break, drink some water, breathe..",0
"Less what ‚Äúfloats in my boat‚Äù and more what has actually happened, but okay.  Warner Brothers owns the footage and the legal ability to distribute it. As long as it‚Äôs unreleased I‚Äôll blame them for not doing so, not the scoopy pants they‚Äôll send as distractions.",2
"Variety also broke the story about an insider who called the cut ""unfinished"" and ""assembly only"", didn't they?  That story isn't looked upon very favorably now is it?",2
"Ay man, it‚Äôs cool if you hold Variety to such high regard. Just don‚Äôt tell strangers online that they need ‚Äúpsychiatric help‚Äù or that they ‚Äúare disconnected from reality‚Äù just because they don‚Äôt share your perspective, mkay?  I‚Äôm sure there are far less childish way to disagree with someone. You remind me too much of myself when I was first learning to debate online.   And I‚Äôm sure you or others would have said the exact same words in regards of the Hollywood Reporter before the Joker2 rumorfest went on.",1
...NPR ain't all that my friend.,1
I don‚Äôt need to when I already know an actual website‚Äôs severe lows to garner clicks while continuing to sound completely uninformed.,1
"To the risk of being repetitive:  I get that. But if all the information provided by nameless sources gets constantly debunked by named individuals that worked on the film, you can‚Äôt really fault me if I trust one over the other.",0
"You're welcome, bro",1
Truly you represent your nickname haha,1
Thank you! you couldn't have done a better job proving my point,3
"Oh, you‚Äôre one of those people!",2
Like y'all kept saying for Affleck being out until the day it was confirmed and made people who were in denial look stupid,2
">I'm saying the burden of proof is on the ""insider"". Not the journalist.  The proof here is that the insider is an insider. Meaning that they know what happens inside the studio. So most likely conclusion is that the insider is someone who works there.  >It's not the journalist's fault that they can't call a source on BS and have to report it.  They don't have to report it. If the journalist thinks that the info might be BS, they can either confirm it from another source or simply not include that info in the article. Variety's article wasn't just one news story, so if Kroll had thought that the whole ""Snyder cut is not happening"" thing is inaccurate, he most likely wouldn't have written that in his article.  >He wouldn't get fired for saying ""we're not doing anything"".  No, he wouldn't get fired for saying ""we're not doing anything"". He would be fired because if his name was on the article, suits at WB would've seen that a guy named Whatever Whateverface is talking with press without their permission.",2
"has happened just like it was going to get released at comic con, right?",1
If this were a political debate he'd have already gone on to calling everyone here a Nazi just to shut people up.,2
Really? Haha thanks. I wanted a really good name that highlights the characters I like and the things I think we all strive for haha.,1
Riiiiight,0
I know. I use common sense and think for myself. A rare trait in these modern times.,0
For every thing they get right there are 10 they get way wrong,1
And you‚Äôre using a debunked rumor I never believed in as an argument because...?,2
You‚Äôre telling me,2
Making up statistics like that isn't a proof you think it is,1
They can make shit up. I can make shit up.,0
They are a reputable trade with proven record.  You are a rando on the internet making shit up and throwing a tantrum because they said something you don't like. üòÇ  Get a life dude. One that doesn't revolve around a movie.,2
Horse shit my lies are just as good as theirs,0
Whatever you need to tell yourself to sleep better I guess.,1
I see headphones lower left hand corner tho,2
pleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleaseplease let me watch this movie again assoonashumanlypossible!!,1
A society that abandons and treats people like trash!,2
Damnit. I wanted to say exactly that üòÇ,1
i don‚Äôt think this is a shot from the film i think someone on the production took it,2
The ‚Äújoke‚Äù did a major leap over your head lmao.,3
Wow I can‚Äôt believe they went back in time just to film this movie /s,1
I know I was just being funny,1
"Damn, Momoa looks great there. Need that photo in high quality for... research purposes lol.",3
Oh? You're approaching me?,2
Dudes got pecs like the Rocky Mountains,3
Luke Evans is spot on. Maybe because that mustache suits him well,3
"Sinestros appearance is based off actor David Niven. Luke Evans looks like he could be his son. Spot on,",3
"Luke Evans. He's also good in ***Dracula Untold***, a very underrated flick with a great casting.",2
I feel like Luke Evans was born for this role,2
We already had these best possible actor to play him.  Unfortunately everything else on the movie was shit.,2
"Man Luke Evans is perfect for Sinestro. If a GL movie ever gets off the ground the perfect casting would be James Mardsen (Hal Jordan), Stephan James (John Stewart), Luke Evans (Sinestro).",1
Plus he is already Doctor Sivana,2
"I can excuse Greek mythology, flying aliens, people running faster than the speed of light, but I draw the line at people talking underwater, that just doesn't make any sense.",3
Man imagine the entire aquaman movies with clicks and shit LMFAO,3
Aquaman ‚Äòs was fine. Don‚Äôt overthink it.,3
"It was just a bad creative idea, to make bubbles. James Wan did the right thing.",3
"I thought it would be a situation like on Krypton in Man of Steel where they were speaking English but probably actually weren't and it was just presented like that, but hey Zack didn't get a chance to flesh this one out. The bubble provided privacy.",3
"Nothing about Superheroes makes sense, you've just got to pretend it does.",3
One way you could interpret it would be that through suspension of belief they were actually speaking atlantean in Aquaman instead of English,3
Lol there‚Äôs no reason to make it that complicated. Just make them talk. Jesus.,3
Bad creative decision by Snyder and his reasoning is ridiculous considering what kind of movies he makes. James Wan made the right move.,3
"I think even Snyder's fans need to admit this was a dumb idea.  He can communicate with fish, but no, taking underwater is *way* too unrealistic...",3
"that's just stupid, there's no reason Atlanteans can't have evolved to be able to speak underwater.",3
BuT aLl BaD dEcIsIoNs In JuStIcE LeAgUe CaMe FrOm JoSs WhEaDon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,3
"Lmao come the fuck on  Squeaks and clicks?! Seriously???   I‚Äôm all for the release of the Snyder cut just to get a different look at Justice League because I hate the one we got, but it‚Äôs shit like this that really affirms he shouldn‚Äôt have been in charge of starting a shared universe.   That would have been a horrendously bad and laughable decision.",3
>>*‚Äùit makes no sense‚Äù*  The characters he‚Äôs referring to are Atlanteans... None of their powers ‚Äúmake sense.‚Äù,3
So were are the people who keep saying that Snyder ‚Äúhelped‚Äù Wan with making his movie?,3
"Having the Atlantean‚Äôs speak a more underwater-ish language certainly makes sense (and would be cool as fuck). I definitely understand why Wan didn‚Äôt go this route as well. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so cool about having different creators tackle the same IP, you get a bunch things approached in different ways.",3
That's a dumb idea,1
Am I the only one fine with both ways. The whole thing with DC atm is that directors should get to do whatever they want and while honoring broad plot strokes is good the details and aesthetics don't need to be the same movie to movie. It's a loose continuity that can be whatever the director wants.,2
"Proof that god is not all good lol. I'll always just headcanon it that the Atlanteans have reason to believe Arthur needs the air bubble to communicate because he's a land lover. Even Wan made it so the air bubble has practical, in-universe functionality.",2
I am of the opinion they should have used sign language.,1
Well looks like I can blame that bullshit on Zack,2
"Hang on, sound travels slower through denser materials, so couldn't they just modulate their pitch to speak normally, like people with deep voices can do with helium?",1
"Glad he was fired, Wan had better ideas for Atlanteans",1
"Or telepathy, I always thought that Snyder was going to use telepathy for atlanteans.  But he likes that other directors do what they want/use their own vision so of course he would let Wan do what he want",1
"One of the few things of his vision I don't agree with. Talking underwater is fine, these characters were meant to lol",1
He's not wrong though. Talking underwater is silly but these are comic book characters with super powers and that's silly too. Still would've been neat to see Jason doing some squeaks and clicks under water lol,0
"Lol wow this forum is laughable. Yeah Snyder overthought it but what he says makes sense. Have you tried talking underwater? Guess what, you can‚Äôt. Sea animals communicate through clicks and the like so of course he‚Äôd consider it. Would he go through with it? Most likely not. So given he was trying to ground this world in a reality much like our own, of course he‚Äôd consider this rather than just having them talk underwater. Wan did good, going with his gut and it works but don‚Äôt sit there as if this is justification for Snyder leaving the project. You just look even more desperate.",0
"That would be cool, they'd have their own language!!! Plus some signs and actions!!",0
I feel grateful everyday this abomination and a disgrace got fired.,0
"Lol seriously. The arbitrary bits of realism make no sense if you take the universe as a whole. It‚Äôs like what Grant Morrison said. Paraphrasing here obviously, but ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter. These people aren‚Äôt real. Kids can tell the difference between fantasy and reality, but adults can‚Äôt.‚Äù",3
"Honestly, speaking underwater is more believable than a flying alien that looks exactly like a human. It would be really great, however, if they have used a different language than English. No dolphin noises though!",3
Not to mention his story was gonna include time travel,3
"Dude, there‚Äôs a difference between allowances for sci-fi elememts to exist in a real world (e.g., Flash being able to run fast without the friction burning his skin off) and something that is solely a real world rule of science, such as sound waves not being able to carry through water and sound EXACTLY AS IT WOULD in air.  You can literally go put your face in the bath tub and try talking. Let us know if it sounds like you do when you talk normally.    In any event, it‚Äôs just down to preference.  Snyder didn‚Äôt like it, Wan was OK with it. Doesn‚Äôt make one an asshole idiot or the other a genius.  Unless one wants to work in their personal biases.",1
It would be a silent film.,3
Go all the way and have the Atlanteans blow bubbles to use echolocation.,2
Imagine actors having to make those noises üòÇüòÇüòÇ,2
Lmaao this is too funny,2
Better than fine.  That's a really fun movie,2
Its essentially like GOTG where none are actually speaking English but they all have ear pieces that translates it,3
Yeah. Like in the first Guardians there‚Äôs a blink and you miss it detail that Quill has a translator implant.,3
"Or you could interpret it that Snyder's idea is stupid, and they should just talk.",3
"That‚Äôs Snyder for ya, getting lost in his own head is his speciality.",3
"You don't get it. It's about internal logic. It's the same reason supes lifting the building in JL without it falling apart is lamented. It's why we hate that he uses ice breath without explanation or build up. Zack takes the time to explore these things so he makes the supernatural elements feel more real and almost scientific. They make sense in the narrative.   How does one hear someone talk under water? Breathing under water is fine. Just say Atlanteans' biology is different; they have gills. However sound doesn't travel the same way under water as in the air. As soon as you open your mouth the water goes in. Even if you could form words what will it sound like?  The aquaman film version gets rid of this by essentially saying, ""it's comic books don't think too hard or take it seriously"". That's the point. Zack takes it more seriously than anyone.",0
I thought it was neat.  I also liked what Wan did.,3
"Yea, this and Killing Cyborg's father are two terrible decisions imo.",2
See I can appreciate why they kill Silas but it really sucks since he's one of the few cast members Cyborg has,1
"I wish more Twitter Snyder fans understood this instead of calling Wan a ""traitor"" lmao",3
THANK YOU.,2
This isn't about directors having their own freedom to make their own creative choices. Of course they should.   But allowing freedom doesn't mean we as an audience cannot call out an idea as dumb. Like this one is.,2
Nah dude you have to pick a SIDE and base all of your opinions about everything according to which team you‚Äôre on,2
"No, obviously you have to pick a side. Because god forbid anyone have complex or unique opinions.",0
Snyder wasn't going to direct aquaman,1
"At the very least, he definitely had one, very important, better idea.",1
">would‚Äôve been neat to see Jason doing some squeaks and clicks under water  In JL, perhaps. But can you imagine doing that for practically a whole film in Aquaman?   No chance Wan would have kept that, and frankly it‚Äôs a bit worrisome that Zack didn‚Äôt consider that aspect of it. Sure, talking is silly, but the better option of the two for a film that spends a lot of its time underwater.",3
"Have you tried shooting laser beams from your eyes? Guess what, you can‚Äôt.",3
"Have you tried flying? Guess what, you can‚Äôt.  Have you tried being an immortal Amazonian warrior? Guess what, you can‚Äôt.  Have you tried running at light speed? Guess what, you can't.  Have you tried communicating with fish? Guess what, you can't.",2
[It's this one I believe](https://i.redd.it/tcvbb8xz7rn21.jpg),3
"Not to be that guy but Jor-El specifically looked for a planet where he could fit in, and he chose Earth since kryptonians and humans are nearly identical.  &#x200B;  Yeah, I'm that guy...fuck...",3
Correct. This is the same man who said that Batman and Superman conversing while in costume was silly...which is why they hardly speak to each other in BvS.,3
"That‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous, the mental gymnastics y‚Äôall would go to damn. Can you just not admit that that he was wrong ??????? Is Snyder some type of  god person that can do wrong at all???   Super-strength flying heatbeams breathing talking underwater and co are ALL SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES. They don‚Äôt call them Superheroes for nothing. There‚Äôs absolutely no difference in a suspension of disbelief between seeing Superman fly and Aquaman talk underwater.  That‚Äôs like saying Spider Man can have spider senses but Hulk can‚Äôt turn green.",3
Yeah imma have to call bullshit on that one,2
There's an octopus playing the drums. I think we can suspend our disbelief for talking underwater.   Not everything needs to be serious and logically explained in detail.,3
"‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it‚Äù basically the condescending reply used by Snyder fans everywhere. You should get t-shirts. Nothing to get, it was a dumb idea and thankfully Wan didn‚Äôt use it. Difference between Wan and Snyder? Wan made a coherent watchable movie and is now looking to the future rather than constantly uploading pictures of what he would have done like some failed school band member.",2
Aquaman was great because it embraced the weirdness   Also didn't Supes lift a rocket in BVS exactly like how he holds the building in JL  or that time he shifts a tectonic plate offscreen?  Exactly   The bubbles were dumb as hell regardless,2
Zack did a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong (like killing off Jimmy Olsen for one....) but I just interpreted it as Mera water bended the water to stop Arthur from leaving so they could talk. Although that was in the JL TC and seemingly here Vulko also has this ability so I'm gonna have to say that's another knock on Snyder. IF it was legit used to stop Arthur from leaving its genius but if Zack intended for the water bubbles to always be their form of talking then yeah I'm gonna chalk that one up as another bad idea personally,1
"Ugh, that's how Nelson was attacked and Cavill was scrutinized as well. We discourage militant reactivity from all sides of an issue here. Tribalism of any stripe is a recipe for cyclical conflict and willful ignorance.",3
And I wish more Snyder haters understood it‚Äôs okay to look at things differently,0
YOU‚ÄôRE WELCOME. Also great username.,1
"But they cut most of the Atlanteans scenes making Wan having the posibility of doing his own thing, in this version Vulko is super different from the Aquaman movie (by far better in Aquaman, here he looks like a generic medieval noble guy),",1
"James Wan idea about making them super advance society is by far better than making them medieval, it's boring",1
"It would've been obnoxious as hell to listen to that but I'm sure they would've showed the language at the beginning with subtitles and then transitioned to regular talking. Either way, I should've said funny instead of neat because it would've been hilarious to see the actors doing this!",1
I‚Äôm not an alien.,0
"All of which are abilities shared by gods and aliens or those who‚Äôve had supernatural occurrences happen to them.   Have you tried not being a smartass? Guess what, you can‚Äôt.",0

Yes. Thank you. People in this sub need to get more acclimated with this quote because I maintain that going against it really hurt the DCEU.,2
"Yeah, but that's what I am saying. How two planets so much different are populated by beings so much similar to each other? This is one of the things that bothers me regarding the Superman's premise.",2
God that was so stupid,3
"Awful. And when they did, ""is she with you"" came out of batman's mouth lol. Just awful.",0
">That‚Äôs like saying Spider Man can have spider senses but Hulk can‚Äôt turn green.  Thats a bad analogy as theyre both part of their ""powers"". A better analogy would be like hulk can turn green, but caps serum or whoever/whatever shouldn't allow them to smoke a cigar underwater. Not defending it, im just showing you how he probably thought of it",0
That's the difference between Wan and Zack. Zack wouldn't have the octopus playing drums and it isn't about suspension of disbelief. It's about world building.   The DCEU used to be relatively (the key word being relatively) grounded. Kind of like how GOT was grounded fantasy. Like the supernatural stuff was still there but there was a mystery and realistic aesthetic about it. It's a sci-fi universe but the individual elements have internal logic preventing things like octopus playing drums.  Anyway I miss when we had this identity. A grounded comic book world. Not the dark Knight which is our world with Batman but the actual comics written with similar logic and rhythm as our world.,0
"Pockets of air work underwater. It's makes more sense than just talking underwater.    The tectonic plates thing was only seen in the background of one shot in a ""blink and you'll miss it"" newspaper clipping. It's not as jarring as seeing it onscreen. It's like hearing this Superman saves cats out of trees. The scene is written in a way that Bruce could be using hyperbole or he could be actually referencing something this Superman has actually done. Clark doesn't bother to contradict him or act like his accusation is ridiculous. Seeing this Superman do that wouldn't break internal logic but it would be jarring. It's out of the way enough it doesn't affect anything like the tectonic plates thing.  The rocket was better distributed than the building. The world doesn't suddenly become a cartoon so Superman can look good. Imagine he turned back time by flying around the earth. That would be ridiculous.",1
The weight of the rocket is mostly distributed on his hands. The building was way too large to keep intact.  Also when did he shift a tectonic plate?,0
Yeah people forget Zack made a ton of questionable choices with these movies,2
But god is tribal.,2
Wait when were Nelson and Cavill attacked,1
Boom!,0
"Ok, I'm waiting for the punchline ;)",1
wasn't wan saying aq picks up after Snyders version?,1
Right... so if you aren‚Äôt Atlantean this still doesn‚Äôt apply to you lol,2
And talking underwater is an ability shared by Atlanteans. Case closed.   Stop twisting yourself into a pretzel defending this bad idea he had. You're allowed to like him and still recognize a bad idea as one.,2
"Hahaha that one is fucking great.    Morrison is amazing, I wish Hamada would actually tap him for some collabs in the DCEU. Animal Man that is a mix of Soule/Lemire and Morrison. Inject that shit into my veins.",3
"It can definitely happen. we have animals here on earth that evolved to look similar but aren't actually related  If our design is one that can create the dominant species here, in a really big universe there's a chance at least one other species may follow a somewhat similar path",1
"The world is large enough for there to be semi realistic elements and just fun, bonkers stuff like an octopus playing the drums. Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok coexist just fine together in the same universe.",3
GOT and ASOIAF has always been high fantasy tho   The main threat were goddamn Ice Zombies for gods sake,2
It's offscreen but BVS mentions him shifting a plate to stop an earthquake. Plus Supes did drag that ship through solid ice in the same film  You can see it on the wall to the right in the link below  [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/c/ce/BvSFeat.png/revision/latest?cb=20170605194341](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/c/ce/BvSFeat.png/revision/latest?cb=20170605194341),1
"What the heck, why would there be a FAKE Jimmy Olsen. He should have just been some other guy.",2
"I never said it was a good idea. In fact, all I said was that made sense. Sometimes things that make sense in the real world don‚Äôt work in film. Quit getting your panties in a bunch because I defended the notion that Snyder is allowed to think creatively and he tends to ground things in our reality, including the supernatural to a certain degree. Yeah it‚Äôs not that good of an idea. He‚Äôs still allowed to consider possibilities.",0
Last thing i knew he was writing the Flash script with Ezra.,1
">in a really big universe   Thats the issue. The universe is so large that the Kryptonians should have come across another earth-like planet in their space travels, where they have superpowers.",1
In this world I believe anything can happen however when telling a single narrative it needs to be limited otherwise we could have all sorts of clashing tones in one scene and the audience would be jarred.  Zack established the DCEU's tone. Some small deviances from this aren't the end of the world as long as it stays within that tonal range. SS was in that tonal range. WW towed the line but Aquaman was completely it's own thing. Instead of LOTR style Atlantis which fits  the aesthetic and tone of the universe we get science fantasy like cartoon like space suits. The unique quality that the universe had. Something no one else could mimic and what had worked so well for DC was abandoned for a universe without cohesion or internal logic. All the detail was thrown away and the films feel weightless as a result.,0
You aren't understanding my point. Having aliens is fine. Having immortal women as a whole culture is fine. A Frankenstein ed monster using an alien corpse is fine. It's not about the fictional elements. It's about the explanation and logic they run on.   Talking underwater has no explanation. It doesn't make sense. It's fine in anything else but in the DCEU which famously was quite grounded it's disappointing.,1
Wow good eye.,1
It was shown that the people in the outposts all ended up dying after kryptons destruction though.  And Jor-El knew earths sun and environment/composition would make Superman stronger; so they probably had that knowledge from experience and/or research,1
Thanks (I'm into VS Debates so this comes up a lot),1
"Eh, still a weird choice to make Jimmy Olsen a CIA agent, only to get killed so soon. Would have been cool to have him in a trio with Clark and Lois.",1

Interesting. People were theorizing that snyder talked to the cast about hashtagging it but this suggest he didn't unless Cavill refused which would be damning.,3
"Henry Cavill hasn't got twitter. Also, he did admit that he didn't like the theatrical cut of Justice League in the Men's Health interview, but the man just wants to move on from it. I can't blame him.",3
Is this surprising? I‚Äôve never heard much positivity from Cavill towards BvS or any cut of JL. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs at all happy with what Snyder did with the character and most of what he‚Äôs spoken of wanting for the future is like the opposite of a Snyder movie.,3
"Ben is done as Batman, Gal and Jason are safe as there characters. Henry isn‚Äôt safe and wants to be back and is just trying to play by WBs rules. If anyone doesn‚Äôt understand that or is mad about it, you‚Äôre a dumb loser tbh",3
Henry doesn‚Äôt care lol,3
Here's the full comment.  https://twitter.com/Suhail_SeA/status/1199349029022224387?s=19,3
This cuts off half of the original comment...,2
I don‚Äôt blame Henry at all for not joining in. He probably wants to fight and cling to the role as long as he can. Maybe he‚Äôs already spoken with WB or his agent has. We don‚Äôt have all the details. So him not being apart of that push doesn‚Äôt surprise me one bit.,3
"Henry is just clinging to the last shred of hope that WB will give him another movie and doesn't want to do anything to hurt his chances. Sadly, I don't think he will ever wear the suit again, as WB has already made several moves (Shazam headcut,  Hoechlin tv show, JJ talks, Michael B. Jordan pitch) to show they have no problem moving on without him, so it's going to be for nothing. Ironically, his best chance would probably be the release of the Snyder Cut, for if it's positively received it could reignite interest in seeing more of him in the role.",3
"The initial comment is incomplete. It was: ""Man I wish Henry joined us for the event, but I guess in time he will join us, am I right?""",2
Why is this post incomplete??,1
How about posting the full comment next time?,1
He probably doesn‚Äôt run his social media. Most of his posts are staged marketing type posts and not ‚ÄúI have my phone here‚Äôs what‚Äôs up‚Äù posts and if he‚Äôs negotiating with WB why help them? The ones under WB probably got the nod from handlers and the studio for the free publicity,1
Like his manager said. He's playing the strong hand. And probably focused on Witcher and not fucking up any chances with WB.,1
"Argh this who #releasethesnydercut drama is confusing. As well, as messed up as it sounds, I hope this means Cavill is cooking some deal in the background lol.",1
"Henry Cavill seems like not a team player. He has time to 'like' BossLogic's fanart of Superman vs Brainiac on instagram, but doesn't have time to show a bit of loyalty and support for the director who made his role happen. Ben Affleck has no skin in the game anymore, and he still showed support. Henry lost a lot of cool points for me. Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, and Ray Fisher have loyalty, and I respect and admire them the most.",0
"Henry addressed his feelings on a Snyder cut last year, before he started production on the Witcher.

This isnt the full comment. The guy was saying how it was a bummer that Henry couldn't comment. However the guy then further goes and says that he will join us in the Sun or something similar to that and ask am I right Zack? With Zack replying I feel you. Meaning that Zach is getting at what the guy is referring to. For example when Zack did that post that said he has yet to rise.,1
Nice of you to cut off half the comment. You guys are just as bad as those who take Snyder's words out of context to bash him.,1
Henry is a weird dude. This is well known in the acting community. He ain't superman right now so why would he.,0
I bet Zack asked him. I bet he asked all of them and only Cavill resuded to do it. Disgusting.,0
Come on this is an excuse everybody is using now. There is no such thing.You know how many people are promoting supporting multiple projects while having Netflix movies?  Timothee Chalamet just spoke a lot about Dune a WB movie while promoting the King.  Maybe Cavill just wasn't on board with Snyder's vision and he didn't want to participate. Why can't people accept that? Stop finding excuses for it,3
I don't think Netflix cares. I mean Zack is in post production on one of their movies yet he posts about the Snyder Cut every other day,3
"Definitely. There's probably a clause in his contract that says he cannot promote any other material when working on The Witcher. Plus, there's also the possibility that he is trying to keep a good relationship with Warner Bros, when he's the ""least"" safe person still apparently contracted by them. Or, maybe, he just doesn't want to? Each and all of these are valid.",3
"I don't think anybody is asking him to promote it, we just want him to put a simple hashtag on his Instagram to show support.",2
Movie studios dont own people. Theres no reason Cavill cant tweet support for another movie.,1
Gal definitely got that screenshot from him though. He probably reached out to Henry too,3
Henry recently liked Boss Logic's Superman pic the other day. He just didn't want to participate,3
"Jason Momoa doesn't either, but he used Instagram (which Cavill has). Admitting one doesn't like the theatrical cut also doesn't mean they like the Snyder Cut any better. People seem unwilling to accept that Cavill probably wasn't fully on board with Snyder's vision.",3
He has Instagram tho,1
"nor should he, let the man live",1
"The Shazam thing was the director‚Äôs idea, as he wanted to have Cavill but time constraints didn‚Äôt allow it. The CW uses Barry Allen despite Ezra being still in the role. The talks with JJ have not said anything against or with Cavill, he even previously worked on a Superman film that was gonna star him.  The MJ thing could perfectly be bs or an Elseworlds Earth 2story, nothing negating Cavill.   I understand your intent but you kinda jumped in some points, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary. Hoping for the best too here!",3
"And to that Zack Snyder replied ""I feel you""   Don't post incomplete shit.",2
I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs devastated,3
Nothing wrong with not being a team player.,2
"It‚Äôs funny how you say everything that needs to be said in your comment buy you don‚Äôt actually realize how the whole situation makes sense.  Unlike Cavill, Affleck has left Batman behind.He has nothing to loose.Ray Fisher is gone as well apparently. Gal and Jason are safe.Henry can like every post out there but out right supporting the Snyder cut could mean the end of his negotiations for the role.",1
Its like you expect everyone to have blind loyalty to snyder because you do. You need to wake up and smell the coffee. Henry cavill is free to like or not like whatever he wants,1
Or he just doesn't like Snyder vision and that's why he doesn't support the Cut.,3
Got any proof of him being a weird dude or are you just mad he didn‚Äôt tweet your hashtag?,3
"His recent statements say otherwise. If anything, he‚Äôs the one with the shakiest relationship with WB.",2
Ben isn‚Äôt Batman neither tho. He still did something.,2
"I absolutely love how one minute this subreddit has a raging hard-on for Henry Cavill, and then at the drop of a hat it's out for his blood. There's a weird cult mentality going on surrounding the Synder Cut for some people.",1
Hey Ezra Miller didn't post either right ?   You should be respectful for the ppl that don't want to support the Snyder Cut.  If you harash the ones that don't it's rightful for them to think that the Snyder Cut movement is toxic.,2
"Dune is a official project and he can speak openly about it because of that. Answering a question in a interview isn‚Äôt the same as directly promoting a project. He‚Äôs also not doing social media promotion for Dune.    The Snyder cut is not official. Cavil will probably answer a million questions about it and Superman in his forth coming interviews but voluntarily posting about it especially in this time frame is unlikely, and it‚Äôs probably because he‚Äôs promoting one of the biggest projects of his career. Either way it‚Äôs no huge deal. He personally may not agree or want the attention from that.",1
The calls for the #snydercut actually ask for it to be an HBO Max release. I imagine Netflix would not want for the star of their biggest show this year to come in support of some other media premiering t o a rival streaming platform.,1
"It's a Zack movie, but it's owned by Warner Bros. It would still be promoting another company's movie.",0
Putting the # would be literally promoting the Cut.,2
They do own your contract though and he doesn't necessarily have the most goodwill in relation to the Superman character with WB (at least compared to gal and Jason),1
That's valid. If he doesn't want to participate that's up to him. I wish people would just stop harrasing him about it.,3
I think initially he was all on board during Man Of Steel. I think BvS is where the twos individuals visions of the character diverged. Its why he isnt in staunch support but also dislikes the theatrical JL cut as well,3
I think it's more likely he has no idea which vision would be best because he's an actor not a writer but wants to leave the Snyder era behind.,0
Cool. Doesn't mean he has to participate in the Snyder Cut movement. He clearly wants to move on from that. Let him.,3
"For additional context, there was also those rumors that Cavill tried to renegotiate his contract and demanded more money and creative power and then quickly after that WB put forth that they were looking into doing a Supergirl movie which all the analysts interpreted as WB strong arming Cavill to either accept a lower deal or they'd just move on from him. It seems like Cavill hasn't backed down (suspected to be the due to bad advice from agent Dany Garcia) and WB keeps exploring new Superman projects without him.",3
 [Mr. Jordan as Calvin Ellis.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvVyB25aOco) His movie and a Supergirl movie are more likely to happen than a MoS sequel.,0
"Dave Bautista's job as Drax with Disney was also at risk, but he didn't stop speaking out for James Gunn. That's what the real Superman would do. He would stick up for his friends, protect the ones he loves, etc.",1
"I don't do coffee, but I agree, people need to wake up. Have a nice Thanksgiving, peace.",0
Nah it not that he already stated in a article he didn't like the theatrical version that was released. It was because of the reshoots that Whedon did was the reason for the whole mustache thing. Snyder version was already done with superman.,0
"It's not just his hashtag, there are millions who support the movement and understand what it signifies.   The facts are Cavill didn't do the hashtag and it seems like you didn't either (hmm), if he wanted to support Zack, the guy that gave him his big break, he could of.",0
How old you bro with that type of response? Lol,0
Ben left for personal reason. If he didn't become a drunk he would still be batman.  Henry basically was fighting for new contract and got canned. Different situations.,1
"And with you about the harassing part, but just keep in mind that Ezra doesnt have social media (Henry has instagram) and he still supported Zack and the cut in a lot of interviews.  But as you said, this isnt the way.",1
"My point is, it's a very simple request.  We're not asking him to go on a press tour.",0
"He don't get to be outside the drama, that selfish and asshole move. Thousands of fans wan't every bit of support and he has to show it .",0
I think he definitely liked his Superman portrayal there in TC JL despite the movie being shite.,2
Lol he's also a viewer. He has as much of an idea as you or I.,2
"He has spoken in interviews about what type of Superman movie he wants to make and has spoken about the comics he likes. He has a vision, and its pretty much the opposite of Snyder's vision.",1
"Sure, why not. At least its Superman material and not.. Harley Quinn.",1
Chinese Superman is more likely than Cavill returning at this point.....,0
You do realize superman is not real right?,0
Him disliking the theatrical cut doesn't mean that he supports the Snyder Cut.  Not saying that he is against it being released.   But if he doesn't support the Release the Cut campaign...I assume he doesn't supports the Release the Snyder Cut campaign.,1
>there are millions who support the movement  There probably isn't even a million people who know what a Snyder Cut is lmao.,3
How old you bro,3
"How old are _you_, bro? Literally what response is _this_? It's completely unrelated to what he just said. Are you projecting?",2
I see your point but I think it‚Äôs all the more reason to campaign actually. And it‚Äôs a team effort.,1
"Didn't know about Ezra, ty.",1
He probably doesn't care that much.,1
He *has* to? He doesn't have to do anything just because some sweaty nerd on Reddit wants him to.,1
Definitely not opposite. His favorite comic is For Tomorrow which has a lot of similar vibes to Man of Steel and BVS Superman  He's also spoken highly of Red Son,1
"Ah okay, my bad, I don't know much about the guy. I was going off the impression I have of most actors having no idea what to make of the film until it's released beyond empty contractual spiel intended to fill seats. Many of the BvS actors regarded it as a ""for the fans"" CBM despite the fact Batman tortures and kills so they all seemed pretty out of touch to me, Cavill included. Jesse Eisenberg hasn't even seen it.",1
I'd be down for Black Superman tbh,0
Are you telling me that Man of Steel is not a documentary? But it was shot with a shaky camera...,0
Ok you are disregarding common sense. Have a nice day üëç‚úä,0
Don‚Äôt even try dude. These guys are borderline delusional when it comes to Snyder.,3
Did you not see how many retweets it got? Did you not see how many followers for example Ben has and he tweeted it out. Ok bud lol. These non Snyder supporters can be something else man.,0
Lol smh üëç,0
Yea I guess but at this point unless they plan on continuing justice league story I see no point in them releasing it. They're going to continue doing solo movies. Justice league is pretty much dead if you ask me.,0
"He has to because he owe it too the fans, Galot and Aflex already done their part.",0
He also said hed like to make a movie that drew on the comics and  where Superman was joyful and hopeful and protected people as well as being strong and a badass. The implication being that he hasn't gotten to do that yet.,0
Didn‚Äôt we get that with Hancock?,0
Don't get me started man.,0
It‚Äôs hard to gauge when we don‚Äôt even know how many tweets were unique and how many times each person tweeted out. It was a planned mass tweeting. The numbers could be inflated when people are tweeting multiple Times each.,2
They didn't get tweeted and retweeted millions of times though. That campaign last week Sunday ended with around 700k tweets. Plus there were many people tweeting about the Snyder cut again and again.,2
So about 15?,1
Nah he don't owe you shit.,1
Are you implying you can give anyone super powers and they're Superman?,1
"Nah, get started. What you got?",1
Legally no but morally yes.,0
Not at all. He clearly doesn't give that much of a shit about it and there's nothing wrong with that.,1
"You didn't read the comment, I'm not even gonna bother argue with you kiddo.",0
Bail.,3
"He‚Äôd be better than Amboyer, that‚Äôs for sure.    All kidding aside, I wasn‚Äôt completely sold on him as Solo, and I think he‚Äôd be even less perfect as Hal.",3
Oh shit!   When was Hal in Millennium Park?,2
I think Bradley Cooper is the right Hal Jordan.,1
I‚Äôve literally been saying this since Solo came out. Glad I‚Äôm not alone,1
I would go for a more mature Hal but yeah this is solid.,1
That's actually a very good fan cast. Chapeau.,1
Would that i-twere so simple.,1
We don't want Hal Jordan.,1
Why do people want Hal Jordan so bad? For the sake of diversity and them being more popular characters I would rather we have John Stewart or Jessica/Simon be the new GL. Hal Jordan can be an older/mentor to them.,1
He can,0
He was awful as Han Solo. Hard pass.,0
DC is just sucking balls lately,0
My phone's autocorrect has failed me,1
"Better than who?   I feel like he played the whole cocky, good natured deep down but won't show it type of character really well. Plus he's a decent age to play the character for a long time",2
promotional image for a comic convention in Chicago,1
I would love him as well,1
Thank you. It's the first thing I've seen with him in it and that was my first thought after the movie ended,2
"There are ways around that. Tom Hardy was able to play Bane and look huge and intimidating, yet he's shorter than Christian Bale",1
You don't want Hal Jordan. I know I definitely do,1
"Well the original idea was basically a buddy cop style movie with Hal and John, which I love the idea of",1
"I thought he did as well as someone could do, considering who he was following up and the lack of reason for the movie to exist",2
"To each their own, but because he didn‚Äôt do good in one role means he won‚Äôt do good in another?",1
Your autocorrect...bailed.,3
"Back when they were shooting BvS, people were convinced a guy named Dan Amboyer was playing Hal, based on a pic of him wearing a jacket on set that **resembled** (wasn‚Äôt one, it was his own personal jacket) a pilot‚Äôs jacket. His actual role was basically as a glorified extra.   I wasn‚Äôt really buying his cockiness, and I‚Äôd argue that Hal is straight up arrogant at times, not just cocky. Can‚Äôt see Alden making that work.",2
Dan Amboyer was a ‚ÄòDrone Pilot‚Äô in BvS. But he kept posting photos of him looking like Hal Jordan.,1
Take a look at Hail Caesar. He's really funny in that movie.,1
"I mean if you go back and read the coverage around the film, many of the reported issues were tied to his acting. They even had to bring in acting coaches to help him.   I also haven‚Äôt seen him in anything else to make me feel differently. Would rather them go with a known commodity.",1
Why must you kick me when I'm already down?,2
"Oh ok. Sounds like he was trying to cast himself for the role.  I think Han was arrogant a few times in Solo, like when he cut off Beckett to make that negotiation or when he tried to gamble against Lando towards the beginning. He's not the only actor who I think could play the character, but I think he's my favorite choice at this point",1
Didn't that character die? I can't remember,1
I'll check it out,1
Because this place is full of negative people behind the internet.,2
"No, he was a DRONE pilot. Superman destroyed the drone.",2
"You're right, I should bail",2
Ok yeah you're right. It's been a long time since I saw it,1
Ford V Ferrari is lemans66 overseas. Hmm.,1
much better title,1
"> First, let‚Äôs be clear about a few things: yes, a Snyder Cut does exist in near-finished form; yes, several people have seen the Snyder Cut; yes, there were multiple edits of the film, including an early assembly cut, but Snyder and his crew continued working on the film and created a more completed version.  > It‚Äôs also worth noting that there was indeed a sustained campaign to convince everyone that no Snyder Cut exists, with some people intentionally spreading false information to mislead the press and public, while others spread the false information because they were misled by their bosses or sources and had no other evidence at the time to convince them otherwise.  > I am not sure what compels some media and journalists to continue denying the Snyder Cut exists after a great deal of confirmation, nor why some of them insist it would require tens of millions of dollars to complete Snyder‚Äôs version (it wouldn‚Äôt, and those claims seem based on the outlets/journalists falsely believing only the assembly cut exists). While Warner could indeed spend some additional money to finish a few elements or tweak a few others, Snyder‚Äôs version could be released as-is without additional spending and viewers would get the full film with 90+% completed footage, VFX, and sound.",3
They‚Äôll release it with hbomax trust,3
Zack also said on vero don't lose hope. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
"Even with this, there‚Äôs no guarantee that we‚Äôll get it.   I was thinking yesterday about how The Fantastic Four is revered with Marvel Comics stories as The First Family. No where was this more obvious than when Johnny Storm ‚Äúdied‚Äù during Hickman‚Äôs run.  I was thinking about how the Superman character alone deserves a certain level of reverence for what he represents both in-comic and what he represents as a character, for us.  The Trinity should be treated as royalty. It‚Äôs so messed up that WB us treating them like D-list characters so something.  I mean, how dumb do you have to be  to mess this up.  It‚Äôs almost disgusting that a JL movie in which The Trinity are starring has to be drugged through the mud for so long.  This is despicable.",3
Whose dick do I gotta suck to see the Snyder Cut???,2
"This is an article that everyone should read regarding the Snyder Cut.  Mark says he went from ""It might not exist"" to ""It exists"".   His writing feels genuine with what he learned from past 2 years.",3
I‚Äôm sure this is your typical Mark Hughes bombshell where it‚Äôs 3 pages that ultimately add up to: ‚Äòmaybe WB will release it but maybe not too.‚Äô,3
"Finally a respected publication actually putting out the truth. THR pissed me off with the stupid ""Fabled"" shit. I know we all know this, but a lot of people don't. They need to hear this.",3
Finally someone calling out those ‚ÄúIt DoesNt ExiSt‚Äù people. Absolutely insufferable.,2
"Oh an article that doesn't lean on an ""insider"". Is this imagination land?",2
That's a pretty liberal use of the word bombshell.,2
"""Mark Clickbait Hughes, the man who never delivers"" - Fragile",2
"Whether or not it exists isn't the issue, no studio is going to revisit a two-year old flop or admit that they ruined the movie in the first place. Some fans want to rebel and ""stick it to the man"" for lying to them. I get it. However you can not disregard the studio's POV. If you do, then you're basically saying ""I don't care! Gimme what I want anyway!"". That's just childish and not based in any kind of reality.",1
I see Mark Hughes is back.  At one point he was one of the ‚Äúthree is no Snyder Cut‚Äù people.,1
What negative stuff did Snyder Cut fans do? He mentioned it breifly in the sticker like article. What have we done besides believe?,1
"Anyone with a brain knows this. However, wouldn‚Äôt releasing it basically confirm how stupid WB was for screwing it up with Whedon and reshoots? Why would WB want that egg on their face? Maybe if whoever was in power was no longer there I could see it happening or as some have surmised...because HBO max is coming out.",1
"Mark Hughes is the most overrated ""journalist"" out there.",0
Forbes and their bullshit clickbait...,0
Yeah... I‚Äôm going to believe THR and Variety over Mark Hughes.,0
We want the movie,3
GIVE IT TO ME PLEASE,3
This is honestly the most beatiful and hopeful thing i have read in a long time.,1
I never would.,3
Keep hope alive.  One day.,3
Mostly its what he learned working with Jay Oliva.  And proof given to him of how complete it was by Jay oliva.,3
I gave up on Mark Hughes a long time ago. The dude is just so verbose. Skip to the end?,3
"Nope, this is absolutely a read!  Stuff that is learned through years of being obsessed.    But to have it by Forbes, researched and confirmed is HUGE",3
It sort of does.,1
Take an upvote. Cuz this is exactly the point. Respect in the game. First hand knowledge. And a changed mind moved by proof.,3
>Forbes  >respected publication  Pick one.,0
"THR and Variety both threw cold water on the prospects of the Snyder Cut. To say that one dubious Forbes scooper (and Forbes online, by the way, does not retain the same journalistic standards as Forbes Magazine, anyone can be an online Forbes contributor) should be trusted over 2 of the 3 premier Hollywood trades is textbook confirmation bias.",0
"When this info is produced by Forbes in the way that he writes it, yea.  Bombshell.",1
It is based on reality.   Snyder is in fact in talks with WB. Confirmed by multiple people.   This isnt a 2 year old flop.   Its a unreleased film that a giant online base is calling for and has been calling for for 2 years.   If Mark hughes is 100% correct in the article. Then the cost to release it is solely paying actors and not finishing the film.   They just spent 5 billion on two tv shows. They need all the exclusive content they can get that will bring people to their service.   Especially considering they will be starting many months after every other streaming service.   That is the studio perspective.   The old mistakes of JL were the old regime. Under a different owner. They are now under ATT with new leaders across the board.    Their audience wants to spend money on this.,1
Yes. Which is why this is important. If you read the article he details that he was literally shown proof of film completion percentage and proof of its existence and detailed the behind the scenes drama.   He changed his mind. It is a good thing. It has always been what we in the movement were working for. Knowledge distribution,2
"They wouldn't get egg on their face.  New company.  New CEO.  New just about everything since JL.  They don't have to make a big deal of it when they drop it on HBO max.  Just release it, say it's for the loyal fans, and run off.",1
And?   Its not about Mark.   Its about shifting things away from how WB wants it. Away from the narrative of needing millions to finish or that it was barely completed.   The more articles speaking the truth the better. No matter who is writing them,3
Yes. Do always base content on company.,1
Because they are THR or Variety or because they are trusted writers in front of the articles?  And did Variety or THR actually in fact say anything?  NO  All that was said by either was that when asking an unnamed insider the answer of it's release was it wasn't happening.  Or that there was no immanent announcement incoming?  What the fuck is that worth?,2
"The Snyder cut exists, prob won't get released anytime soon.  WHAT A BOMBSHELL /s",2
"I agree. I don‚Äôt see why Mark gets so much hate. He‚Äôs incredibly detailed in his articles which results in a long read, but I rather read something like this that appears well thought out and specific.",3
"Just a heads up Forbes.com isn't the publication, the website just publishes content with a very low bar of what they allow through. I know this from personal experience working with them.   That's not to say anything written here isn't factual, but contributor content isn't fact checked by an editor or anything and shouldn't be used to lend authority to what's being said.",1
"No man, that‚Äôs exactly what it is. I didn‚Äôt read anything remotely substantial or previously unheard of.",0
What are you trying to accomplish here? Forbes isnt respected but all these website names and bloggers have been the real respected faces?  Like it or not Forbes is a respected publication.   That is a fact. Regardless of your own opinion.  You are running around trying to create conflict. Why?,3
This is a silly comment.,2
"Mark Hughes has been extremely reliable. Not to mention, he's the only one who actually listened to people who worked on the movie. THR called the SC ""fabled"" even when we know it exists. We have the people who made it saying it exists. And THR plugs their ears and refuses to acknowledge it. Hughes is at least saying facts here.",2
Mark Hughes was once with the others saying it didn‚Äôt exist.   He has seen the proof that it does which he wrote about a couple months ago. Soooooo yea. He‚Äôs pretty damn reliable.   Ohhh and variety and THR quote NO ONE from WB ever. Just saying they wont comment or saying someone in the film world called it a pipe dream. Soooooo the guys who asked someone and got a no? Or the guy with first hand knowledge of the films completion?,1
"If by bombshell, you mean ""shit we already knew but presented as clickbait"" then yes. Which is basically all Forbes does these days.",2
"you're right, Kevin Tsujihara was forced to step down earlier this year. So I guess there's really no reason (expect money) to not release it. I used to joke they'd release it for the 10th anniversary 8k edition but hell, it might come out with HBO Max",1
Again a lot of words and no real info. There is nothing in this article that we didn't already know.,0
"You assume I base my observation on just this one article. Just about every iPhone and Samsung Galaxy article is ""New Samsung Leak confirms radically new galaxy phone"" or ""Apple confirms new iPhone"". So yes, the content is representative of the company and, hence, why I call it bullshit clickbait.",0
I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre so upset.,0
It sots behind the Forbes name. Thats all that matters.   All these people only giving credence to certain names.   This guy was shown proof of what hes talking about.   And everybody is here talking about it doesnt matter because Variety has one line in a no information article saying ‚Äúknowledgeable insider calls it a pipe dream.‚Äù  Insiders dont mean shit and its the same non point as always.   Mark Hughes was given the proof to write this article.   Doesnt matter who he is writing it for. Or who he is.   These are facts.   And having Forbes behind him in any capacity just helps it get out to the more mainstream audiences.,0
"Well then you didn't read it all that well.  The main points were the confirmation of previously ONLY SPECULATED information.  That is what matters.    You may have heard of these before..... as rumors.  From one insider or another or some internet personality.  But they've not been in an article confirmed to be the truth by a guy with first hand knowledge.  Besides all that matters is the information being out there.  Being positive, being the facts.  Hearing of things from our circle isn't unheard of, but as someone who has basically read it all, as my wife will tell you, I'm obsessed, these things have never been confirmed.  They have always been speculation against speculation, one writers' word against another's.",2
You don‚Äôt get to say that fucking FORBES is respected but Variety and THR aren‚Äôt. Any one of us could get published on Forbes.,0
"Oh, so Zack Snyder is just some blogger, and it wasn't official until a well known clickbait author posted it on a site that you personally deem as respected.  Gotcha.",0
"Between them, Variety and THR (along with Deadline) broke Robert Pattinson as Batman, Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, Paul Dano as The Riddler, Colin Farrell as Penguin, Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon, Andy Serkis as Alfred, and John Turturro as Falcone.   What has Mark Hughes broken?",1
"Mark Hughes doesn't say anything other than ""The Snyder Cut exists somewhere and should be released"". There's no scoop here. He quotes nobody new either.",3
"Variety and THR are two of the most ironclad, don‚Äôt run stories for clickbait movie sources on Earth.  You‚Äôre basically dying on this hill of ‚ÄúWashington Post and NPR both are saying one thing, but this pretty good Buzzfeed reporter says otherwise so I know where I stand.‚Äù  The Variety article from today also has a quote about it not being even slightly likely.",2
Shit you already knew doesn't matter.  What matters is that someone with verified proof is saying these things.    From a large platform.  To the masses.  While other journalists are spouting bits about Snyder leaving before filming wrapped and other nonsense.  Im 90%+ sure you didn‚Äôt read this thing,3
Yes well i assume u either don‚Äôt understand that this is new information. Because there isnt just speculation behind it. Or i assume you looked at it. Stepped into this room. Screamed ‚Äúclickbait‚Äù and left.,1
Not anger. Just curse when I talk.   But honestly people making comments like you did like there is really any difference between any of these writers or as if THR or variety actually even said anything. Is really quite frustrating to deal with.,1
Why would a Forbes writer have first hand knowledge?,0
Zack Snyder hasnt confirmed anything and nothing he said has been picked up.   Again. Mark Hughes personally witnessed his proof.   He is writing about his first hand account. When he says the cost to finish the film is basically nothing. That is because he was given the proof to say this.  He tells of how Zack kept working on the movie after he left. He tells of a cut that has been shown to others like Mamoa that isnt some half finished film. But a basically finished one,2
"He doesn't break stories. He's mostly a critic and a screenwriter. But when it comes to the SC he's the only one that has actually tried to spread things Jason Momoa, Fabien Wagner, and Ray Fisher have said. On the SC specifically I trust him.",2
He actually says QUITE a bit.   And his quote is himself. He was shown the proof. Which he wrote about in a previous article.   Detailing proof shown by Jay Oliva,2
"> The Variety article from today also has a quote about it not being even slightly likely.  ""from a reliable insider"", just a dude giving an opinion.  And also look to my other comment I sent you.  Don't see why you think I'm bashing some other publication.    I'm just saying that there is no bad sources but ANY big news groups are fantastic.  And again Mark is getting this info from this article from HIS own first hand evidence.  So I don't care what Variety's trusted insider said about it's likelyhood of being released.  Same thing they've been saying for years.",2
"Buzzfeed News is actually decent, they have a Pulitzer. It's different from Buzzfeed, which just runs listicles and ""Which Friends' character are you?"" quizzes.",1
You sweet summer child.,0
>!k.!<,0
"Nah Mark, I'm still here watching you get mad online over everyone's opinion in this thread in your arbitrary pursuit to be ""right"".",0
It is indeed. You wish for a mute button of some sorts.,1
"Because he has been working on a project with Jay Oliva for a while.  They got close, Jay changed Mark Hughes mind on the Snydercut, by showing the proof of it's level of completeness, with first hand footage, which he says in the article and giving him the behind the scenes info of production.  And knowing for a fact that when people right now are talking about seeing the cut like Mamoa, they are in fact talking about the basically finished film.",2
>Zack Snyder hasnt confirmed anything and nothing he said has been picked up.   Stopped reading there.  Literally nothing you said was even on the same planet as the truth. Here's one a thousand examples:  https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a29829942/what-is-the-snyder-cut-justice-league-movie/,0
"So he hasn't said anything new, other than what those people have already said. So what's new here?",0
"This is what Variety says:   >Logistically, however, there‚Äôs little appetite at the studio for spending the millions of dollars it would require to finish visual effects and editing work on Snyder‚Äôs version, particularly as ‚ÄúJustice League‚Äù was a commercial disaster. There are currently no plans to release a Snyder version either in theaters or on HBO Max.  >‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a pipe dream,‚Äù said one knowledgeable insider. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs ever happening.‚Äù  This is what Hughes says:  >While Warner could indeed spend some additional money to finish a few elements or tweak a few others, Snyder‚Äôs version could be released as-is without additional spending and viewers would get the full film with 90+% completed footage, VFX, and sound.  These 2 statements don't actually contradict each other. <10% of a $200M+ film would literally be millions of dollars, anywhere from $2M (1%) to $20M (10%). And even if the film was picture locked (meaning 100% complete), releasing and marketing the film would also cost millions of dollars. So they're both right, but neither add anything new to the existing narrative presented by the trades, which is that Warner Bros. is hesitant to spend millions to release it.",2
"Yea bud, you clearly ain't feelin this gravity.  You know if you don't understand it, you don't have to be here snarking.",3
So the latter than. Cool,1
I'm not sure you know what first hand means....,0
"I literally have no idea what your purpose is here.   Is it that mark is just recycling old shit?  Is it that he is wrong in some way?   Honestly.  If Zack was able to ""confirm"" anything he would have, the story would have been set straight years ago.  But he can't so he hasn't.  Not officially anyways.  And that is my point  Again the point is Mark now has more insider knowledge than others.     The point is to make this narrative the only narrative.   No more articles about an assembly cut or a cut that never got filmed or finished. What arent you getting about this?",2
"The fact that he's compiling it in an article by a publication that people do somewhat trust. Until now the only people who have acknowledged those statements are, well, us.",2
"The film WAS picture locked, it had ADR and everything. This we've known for nearly 1 year now. Cost WOULD be absolutely minimal to finish the movie. Less than $10M.  The release would not have any cost if it was kept to digital release (through HBO max).  Marketing would be the only big cost, to be realistic, but even then it's an alternate cut release, it doesn't need as much promotional material as the original release. So less than $10M.  And seeing how much Warner Bros. made from the MoS and BvS physical copies sales ($116M and $78M) - not even counting digital sales OR the BvS:UE sales - I think it's safe to say that WB wouldn't actually be *that* hesitant to spent <$20M for potentially more than $100M revenues.",2
Then*,1
I do....... he was shown footage.  He was given evidence that lead him to change his mind and know the level of the film‚Äôs completion.     He was shown it. Meaning his knowledge is now first hand knowledge.   Jay oliva gave him a first hand account of behind the scenes drama.   See what im getting at?,2
Way to deflect.,0
Is this a self comment?,2
"I provided evidence to back up my claim. You ignored it and attacked me personally. Would you like to stay on topic, or would you prefer to concede that you're being intentionally obtuse?",0
">I provided evidence to back up my claim.  Your evidence is them referencing a quote Zack gave that countless other bloggers completely wrote off as just him talking or something else.  >You ignored it and attacked me personally.  I didn't attack you personally.  Don't know where you are getting that.  I don't know you personally in order to attack you personally.  I asked what is your purpose.  I asked why are you debating me.  What are you getting at because I sure as hell don't understand your stance on this.  I asked you:  >Is it that mark is just recycling old shit?  >Is it that he is wrong in some way?  I'm trying to continue a conversation I am now thoroughly confused on the purpose of.  >Would you like to stay on topic, or would you prefer to concede that you're being intentionally obtuse?  You are just running around being negative from what I can tell.  As I've said.  It doesn't matter if information is somewhere else.    What matters is, coming from a Forbes article there is first hand knowledge being discussed, that isn't just people speculating or questioning sources, but first hand knowledge of these events.  Of the state of the film.    Written out in an article.    Not just said briefly in a loud room with a drunk and exhausted Zack.    But a writer who worked closely with someone who worked on the film and is close with Zack, and was given this information from a first hand source and was SHOWN proof of completion.  This is my point.  These other articles aren't first hand.  They can't with certainty claim things are true.  But also our only point in why this is great is to help change the narrative.  If all parties begin to agree that this cut is basically finished all around, it adds that next bit of pressure.  It changes the information that people are sharing with their audiences.",1
">I provided evidence to back up my claim. You ignored it and attacked me personally.   I'm not him but even I can see that you are antagonising him.  That ""stopped reading there"" crap is about the most passive-aggressive way you can respond to a comment.",0
ZACK SNYDER HIMSELF COULD NOT BE MORE POSSIBLY FIRST HAND. HE'S THE ONE WHO LITERALLY MADE IT HIMSELF.  Good grief. You got me. I fell for your ridiculous trolling. Pat yourself on the back and go away.,0
"I think WB has an obsession with spinoffs, while they should just focus on the main heroes for now. Remember, they can only put out so many movies a year, and I‚Äôd much rather have Shazam 2 than Riddler.",3
Tbh I don‚Äôt even care to see a Riddler or Penguin movie. Just make another Batman movie instead and include the respective villain wtf.,3
"A Riddler movie would be truly unique in the superhero genre  Outside of that i could see this inspiratiobs from Saw, The Game (that was also Batfleck's influence)",3
"I wouldn't be surprised if we only see Two-Face, Mad Hatter and/or Firefly in Arkham, maybe Batman comes in to interrogate them because a crime resembles their *modus operandi*.  And they can have bigger roles on the sequels.",3
"If they're gonna make another Standalone villain movie like Joker, it should be a Scarecrow horror movie",2
"We don't even need to see the villains themselves, just have a cell full of plants with ISLEY, P on the door and a maniacal clown laughter heard from afar.  Maybe even a Dr Jonathan Crane cameo.",2
"They shouldn‚Äôt overdo it with all the spinoffs, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind cameos of villains for world building or future appearances in later movies. It seems likely they‚Äôre going to have a new Joker for this Batman series, so I think that if they want to introduce him, it‚Äôd be a good idea to include a cameo either in this movie or the sequel, and then have him be the main villain of the third movie. Make it so he‚Äôs already fought Batman at least a few times as well so they have some history when they finally come face to face, I don‚Äôt want to see Batman‚Äôs first encounter with the Joker again.",1
I see this as an absolute win,2
for some reason i doubt this. Reeves seems to have full creative control here,1
"Most villains don't have the depth for standalone movies. They took the biggest and probably one of the most well known villains in entertainment (Joker), that doesn't mean it works for every fucking villain.",1
Ugh. I don‚Äôt need a bunch of villain solo movies. WB is so fucking reactionary.,1
Looks like WB is copying Oprah Winfrey:  ‚ÄúYou get a movie! You get a movie! You get a movie!‚Äù,0
">WB and DC also believe that any of these villains could headline their own spinoff movies  Oh this is what we're doing now huh? Okay.   It would also be nice if these trades could stop saying ""WB and DC"" because i'm certain DC has next to no say in any of the creative or business decisions with these movies.",1
Is this movie made by the creators of Amazing Spiderman 2 and The Mummy reboot? What makes studios think that their audience wants a room of spinoffs. Or a hall of spinoffs. Or an asylum of spinoffs.,1
"The Snyder Cut yeah we don‚Äôt want too many characters bogging down the story people will get lost. So chop it down to 2 hours and remove Flash Cyborg and Aquaman story  The Batman movie yes every rogues gallery villain will appear without an origin including Calendar Man, Rat Man, And Fat Man.   Irony of the fan base and WB",0
"Variety , LMAO , nope !!",0
That's very exciting! With this DCEU will lose the vision of having a Ultimate Justice League movie and will become complete uninteresting with no future. And Disney will buy it. üòë,0
Shazam 2 is happening though. This is all speculation and nothing is confirmed from that report. Some of you are taking that shit as scripture.,2
Maybe general audience prefers Batman's villains to Shazam,1
I'm tired of Batman facing grounded villains too. I wanted to see Man Bat for a change.,3
I imagine there will be a massive breakout,2
The only villain who can really work with a spin off is Catwomen   I would only accept a Riddler spin-off of it was an origin story and a character study like Joker,0
"Lol someone's extremely negative. Disney is definitely not buying DC. JL was god awful and left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. That's in the past, but attempting a new JL any time soon without building towards it would be the worst decision. They'll be fine doing what they're currently doing. Just making better, more distinct films. A shared universe isn't necessary in order to make quality films.",1
"Regardless, I think WB needs to continue reviewing their DCEU plan. The spinoff thing isn't just some wild speculation though, prior to JL's failure they were planning to set up multiple types of spinoffs, like a Joker solo starring Jared Leto, and a Joker + Harley film.  I do think there's a place for spinoffs in the DCEU, but they would work better as limited TV series akin to Disney+ shows for Marvel. That's what WB needs to realize: not everything can work out on the big screen. Use DC Universe or HBOMax to make some DCEU series starring smaller characters, give them cameo/supporting roles in future films. Otherwise, keep the films to the big players. We need to establish a solid ground for DCEU with solo films for the JL members (and a truly successful JL film first) before thinking about all these wild spinoffs like The Trench.",1
I wanted to see Deathstroke.,3
"A movie with villains like clayface or a more monstrous killer Crock would be great, I think this is a perfect time to have a less-grounded batman, go full on-comics",2
Happy Bane noises,1
"I'm not opposed to the idea of spinoffs and extended universes. I am against the idea of the studio shoehorning movies with no scripts or ideas into the movie in currently watching. I don't want to be teased for other movies while I'm watching a movie.  Marvel let their universe build overtime. There was one After Credits scene in Hulk and Iron Man. Easter eggs were sprinkled in the background, not front and center like ""look see? We're cool! We're hip! Please buy more of our movies and invest in this thing that we haven't even began to build yet!!""",1
Me too but it looks like reeves is taking ideas from affleck‚Äôs script after all.,0
Poison Ivy as well.,1
>Happy Bane noises  What would that would even sound like? Menacing Mariachi music?,2
Nah. Disney info just don get leaked. But they pitch a lot of ideas too. Its just a difference on comunication styles.,1
Batman being in Arkham Asylum isn't Ben's idea. I might be crazy but I'm pretty sure there's a pretty popular piece of media featuring Batman inside Arkhan Asylum that's been out for some years now.,3
"Batman is Arkham is a pretty common concept for a Batman story, certainly not unique to Affleck‚Äôs script",2
Don't think so.,2
"Ah yes, Batman: Assault on Arkham.",1
Find it interesting that the Superman section doesn't mention Cavill and his involvment. It really feels the way it was written that his time is up unless some big name comes in with a great idea to include Cavill.,3
"Most exciting part of the article for me is that Green Lantern Corps remains a priority and is still in production, with Johns set to ""deliver a script at the end of the year"". When the show was announced, some thought that meant the end of the movie. According to this, it's not.",3

Sounds like if it‚Äôs ahit the GL show could lead to a connected movie.,3
"So even with a high-budget TV show, they're committed to a Green Lantern movie, with Abrams‚Äô Company* possibly taking it up, and MAYBE Berlanti getting involved as well? Sounds awesome tbh, and maybe the movie and the show will tie in to each other.  Sucks for Superman though. Cursed role haha.",3
Just please keep Henry as Superman. I beg you. I almost bowed out when that THR article said he was done. The character means that much to me.,3
"Nice article. Good news overall. The only negatives being Superman (and Cavill) being in limbo. And that Flash being delayed yet again. üòëbut, it‚Äôs hardly Surprising for both. I just was really hoping for some traction by now.",2
"I understand that #RTSC has a very slim chance but this article never even mentions Dwayne Johnson and Black Adam, obviously a major production in the near future. Also flies in the face of the hints out of the Johnson/Cavill/Garcia camps. Seems less than authoritative and more of a rumor round up.",3
"So, I understand that GL yes, Superman no.  More R rated movies and also no Snyder Cut.",3
"Seems a lot of people are missing the fact that Michael B Jordan‚Äôs production company is set up at WB and the article says nothing about him playing Superman. Maybe he pitched for himself to play the character, maybe he didn‚Äôt",2
 **Warners and DC also still have faith in Ezra Miller‚Äôs smart-ass interpretation of the Flash and are proceeding with development on a standalone film based on the character.**   This is all i care about,1
"This article is a big fat nothing, just repeating stuff that we already know.",3
Cavill or bust,2
Really Hope we Get GL Corps & MOS2!,1
"WB is so stupid, they need to really start taking control of their own narrative with a spokesperson and wait till they actually have some concrete idea of what they are doing before releasing info like this. We've seen articles like this plenty of times already, half of what they are saying in here probably won't stick in coming years. Shared Universe or not, WB really needs to figure out what they are doing, and then communicate it properly to the public instead of through these speculative think pieces. Good PR is honestly one of the things that makes Marvel so good. They make Marvel pretty interactive with fans and feel like an event, whereas WB is treating these movies like a business endeavor and that doesn't really work anymore with fans",2
"Not much in the article is new for us folks. But few things:  \- I would be down for Michael B Jordan Superman if it is a 'Into the Spiderverse' type of movie. If I recall, the black Superman was leading the multiverse team in Grant Morrison's Multiversity  \- Walter Hamada seems to be doing good so far handling DC films. BoP and Suicide Squad are  unique but they need to bring out the (non-Batman) big guns sooner than later eg. Flash solo, GL, Justice League Dark, etc  \- Most likely they're gonna keep it separate but I would love it if the HBO Max GL series complements the GL movie. The movie could focus on Hal or Hal & John while the series will explore the other GL Corps members.  \- Wouldn't be surprised if the Trench movie ends up in HBO Max.  \- No mention of 'New Gods'",2
"The articles through Deadline and Variety come directly from the studio, it's their preferred method of communicating to the public, so this is yet another article since #ReleaseTheSnyderCut hit critical mass where WB has refused to even acknowledge the movement. It's unbelievable to think but I don't think we're getting it.",2
Dope!!! So happy for this.,1
The Michael B Jordan idea is super dumb.,1
"""You can‚Äôt start with a big ensemble movie. You need to earn that.‚Äù  This is literally NOT the problem. Jesus. The problem is they fucked with 2 of 3 films to the point of ruining the characters and the contents and as a result the films failed at the BO.   The film being an ensemble film has nothing to do with it. These suits can go pound sand for not only destroying Justice League but still ignoring the fact that it's their meddling that caused the disaster that was Josstice League.",2
"WB trying to bury fan demands for the Snyder Cut, but we won't relent. Having solo universes is boring compared to a shared universe with a Justice League.  So the Michael B. Jordon Superman pitch is real? What is WB smoking... Beginning to think that Toby Emmerlich and Walter Hamada doesn't really get DC characters. It's also really disappointing that Henry Cavill hasn't come to bat for his version of Superman either (best way to redeem him would be to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut). It'd be cool to have JJ Abrams try to keep the shared DCEU universe alive with a bandage somehow.",0
"MBJ as Superman? Cavill is still there, no?",1
Guess that squashes everyone‚Äôs theories of ‚Äúthe studio is making all the actors support the Snyder cut!‚Äù  I hated seeing support for the cut from directors and actors and seeing people in this sub belittle it as a studio play.,1
"Of course taken with a grain of salt, but I would like this direction. Show off some of the other JL members, look at the success of WW and Aquaman. GL would be a great opportunity, and I think Superman needs some love as well.",1
read,1
"I‚Äôm really hoping that DC‚Äôs recent turnaround success will help usher in an era of comic book movies with darker aesthetics like Joker. If the formula doesn‚Äôt stale with the public over the 20‚Äôs, we could see it become the decade of dark superhero movies, right after the lighter toned MCU",1
"Here‚Äôs an idea: stop trying to use the death of Superman as a story idea!  Jeez, ever since Superman V was pitched, Warner Bros have been trying to use that damn story element. Superman Lives, Superman: Flyby, Superman Returns, Batman v Superman. Just stop. It‚Äôs not gonna work.",1
"(just my theory mind you) Maybe this is part of why no Cavill hashtag support ? Gal and Jason are safe, so they can hashtag all they want. Ray is on the oposite side, maybe he feels he's out, so only has the SC as his ""legacy"". WB may have given Henry hints that he still has a future and don't jeopardize it.",1
"Being rated R isn't the issues, it's that the damn movies need a point otherwise they'll try to be like this other movies where the hero's just make fucking quips and silly jokes in serious moments trying to be funny. That's why JL didn't work (amongst other things)",1
"So I guess that Plastic Man,Booster Gold and Blue Beetle will be made through HBO Max and Hopfully will have connections to the movie universe same as Disney Plus shows and MCU.",1
This article is literally a panel of speculative commentary from outsiders. They have no idea what DC is doing. That's funny to me.,1
"The trades always have all these ‚Äúexclusives‚Äù for upcoming movies but always seem a little late when movies like Birds of Prey and Black Adam move from Development to pre production. Like  WB has obviously been pushing them forward while others aren‚Äôt moving but they always fail to mention them in these articles or have exclusives until casting begins. Watch New Gods be in pre production before any Superman, Flash, or Green Lantern movie is.",1
Honestly at this point I expect a Chinese Superman to be more likely to come out than Cavill returning. I‚Äôm being somewhat facetious but with how Hollywood is now it seems like exactly the kinda stunt they‚Äôd pull,1

The only new news of any note is a renewed focus on Green Lantern which is promising. Everything else though is just stuff we already know that does nothing for me. I know it's just a pitch by Michael B. Jordan but I hope we don't lose Cavill as Superman. Not interested in BOP or SS2 but The Trench sounds like a cool horror type movie they could put on HBO Max. The HBO Max stuff is the most interesting thing in the article to me. If they focus on character driven movies with less mainstream heroes, that could be great. Prioritising story over spectacle.",1
Inside source is probably Toby Emmerich trying to make himself look good.,1
And apparently they said no way that the Snyder cut would ever come out saying it‚Äôs a pipe dream ‚òπÔ∏è. What a sad way to end the article.,0
"Lol, Joker was a hit so WB is going to make more nitty-gritty solo villain movies. WB is so reactionary. I just want them to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, and the rest I don't really care about. Aquaman was cool, but I dunno if we need a The Trench movie.",0
"Variety and it's clickbait news. I don't trust them  But imagine if the rumours were true. WTF are WB thinking. They didn't learn nothing about Joker success I guess. Now a white superman is not relevant for these stupid producers from WB? Three white men (Phoenix, Phillips and Momoa) saved their fucking ass these last two years. And JJ Abrams as director? Oh no no no, this guy fucked the entire Star Wars franchise  Nobody we will go to watch a Michael Jordan superman, certainly not white and not black (who don't care even about Super Man as a whole)  And why Michael B Jordan? Why always him? He's overrated as fuck and play always the same bland character. He will never be at the same level as Mahershala Ali (less known but wonderful actor). Stop with the ""Mac Donald"" actors like Michael B Jordan, Tom Holland, Brie Larson, Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, etc...  I suppose that WB think because MBJ played in BP ( a billion dollars movie) he will be a success garantie. Lmao Black Panther was successful because the movie was attended by the black community since decades. An other actor in the role of Killmonger, wouldn't have stop the success of the movie.",0
"DC Films appears to have hit its stride, rebounding from the commercial failure of ‚ÄúJustice League‚Äù and the critical drubbing of ‚ÄúBatman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice‚Äù with a few well-timed box office successes. ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù and ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù both generated over $1 billion at the global box office, becoming the first DC productions to reach those lofty figures since Christopher Nolan wrapped up his Batman trilogy with 2012‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight Rises.‚Äù The studio also scored with last spring‚Äôs ‚ÄúShazam!,‚Äù a cheeky spin on the spandex genre, and has high hopes for upcoming releases such as ‚ÄúWonder Woman 1984‚Äù and ‚ÄúBirds of Prey.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre on the upswing,‚Äù said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ‚ÄúThey had a rocky period, but they‚Äôre starting to find their footing.‚Äù  DC Films may have achieved more consistency when it comes to reviews and box office performance, but there are still hurdles to overcome. Namely, the company and its parent studio, Warner Bros., have yet to figure out what to do with iconic characters Superman and Batman. The studio is farther along when it comes to Bruce Wayne‚Äôs alter ego, having re-cast the role most recently played by Ben Affleck with the younger and edgier Robert Pattinson. The former ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù heartthrob has moved beyond his tween idol days, appearing in indies for the Safdie brothers, David Cronenberg, and Robert Eggers. He will don the cape and cowl in ‚ÄúThe Batman,‚Äù which will be directed by Matt Reeves (‚ÄúRise of the Planet of the Apes‚Äù) and will feature villains such as the Riddler (Paul Dano), Penguin (Colin Farrell), and Catwoman (Zoe Kravitz).  There had been chatter that the entire film would unfold in Arkham Asylum, the high-security prison known to comic book fans for housing super-criminals, but that is not the case, according to insiders. Only a handful of scenes will be set at Arkham. If the movie works, Warner Bros. and DC believe that any of these villains could headline their own spinoff movies. Key cast members in both ‚ÄúThe Batman‚Äù and ‚ÄúBirds of Prey‚Äù have contract options to appear in sequels and standalone films.  The studio has less clarity on what to do with Superman, a character who has now been rebooted two different times in the last 13 years, once with Brandon Routh (‚ÄúSuperman Returns‚Äù) and later with Henry Cavill (‚ÄúMan of Steel‚Äù) without landing on a winning strategy. Superman has also appeared frequently on television, in shows such as ‚ÄúLois and Clark‚Äù and ‚ÄúSmallville,‚Äù which has led to some fears at Warners that the market could be over-saturated with hot takes on all things Clark Kent.  To help find a way to make Superman relevant to modern audiences, studio brass has been polling lots of high-profile talent. There have been discussions with J.J. Abrams, whose company Bad Robot recently signed a massive first-look deal with the studio, and there was a meeting with Michael B.

Insiders think that a new Superman film is unlikely to hit screens before 2023, given that there‚Äôs no script and no director attached.  Internally, insiders are quick to credit Walter Hamada, the longtime New Line executive who was brought on board in 2018 as president of DC Films, with helping to plot a new, more sustainable course for the DC cinematic universe. He‚Äôs credited with having a strong sense of story and with keeping a firm eye on the bottom line, reining in budgets so productions don‚Äôt go off the rails. It also helps that he is closely allied with Warner Bros. film chief Toby Emmerich, with both men having worked together on past New Line hits such as ‚ÄúIt‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Conjuring.‚Äù Insiders believe that under the former regime of top DC film executives Jon Berg and Geoff Johns and DC Entertainment head Diane Nelson, there were too many decision makers involved, leading to the lack of a clear vision. They also maintain that Warner Bros. erred by initially rushing movies in the hopes of making release dates that had been snapped up before scripts were even fully in place. Emmerich has made righting the DC ship a key priority since taking control of the studio in 2017.  ‚ÄúTheir initial mistake was that they tried to do too much, too fast,‚Äù said Robbins. ‚ÄúThey were trying to copy the Marvel model, but that took time and years of building up characters. You can‚Äôt start with a big ensemble movie. You need to earn that.‚Äù  Under Hamada and Emmerich, the studio has become more comfortable with backing comic book movies for adults. ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù became the first DC release to nab an R rating, but it won‚Äôt be the last. ‚ÄúBirds of Prey‚Äù is also expected to get a similar rating and insiders predict that James Gunn‚Äôs upcoming ‚ÄúSuicide Squad‚Äù sequel will also be R-rated. In the case of ‚ÄúBirds of Prey,‚Äù the film won‚Äôt be in the pitch-black, grim vein of ‚ÄúJoker.‚Äù Insiders describe the film has a more humorous, spirited, girl gang adventure, albeit not one for younger children. A series of recent reshoots dramatically improved test screening results and the studio is confident ‚ÄúBirds of Prey‚Äù will be a hit when it opens in February.  Analysts believe the studio has hit upon a smart strategy ‚Äî 20th Century Fox had backed R-rated comic book movies such as ‚ÄúDeadpool‚Äù and ‚ÄúLogan,‚Äù but after being bought by Disney, which prefers its heroes to be cleaner and less prone to f-bombs, it‚Äôs unclear if it will continue to back those type of projects.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge appetite for R-rated superhero movies and if Marvel isn‚Äôt going to step up, that presents an opening for DC to tap into that audience,‚Äù said Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations.  Beyond embracing the darker undercurrents of the DC canon, the company is also revisiting characters that they believe were ill-served by previous big screen adventures. ‚ÄúGreen Lantern Corps‚Äù remains a priority despite the fact that 2011‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreen Lantern‚Äù was a high-profile commercial disaster. Johns is delivering a script at the end of the year. The project may be presented to Abrams and Bad Robot to see if the company would be interested in producing the picture.

DC is also looking to capitalize on the box office success of ‚ÄúAquaman.‚Äù It is currently looking for a director for ‚ÄúThe Trench,‚Äù a spinoff about a group of vicious undersea creatures who played a supporting role in ‚ÄúAquaman.‚Äù For the next film centered on Jason Momoa‚Äôs king of Atlantis, DC has once again tapped James Wan and is hoping to commence shooting in early 2021.  DC‚Äôs future won‚Äôt unfold entirely on the big screen. HBO Max, WarnerMedia‚Äôs upcoming streaming service, is currently looking for DC properties that could inspire films to premiere on its platform. It hopes to make DC adventures that have slightly lower budgets, requiring them to rely on up-and-coming actors and not established stars, with a goal of keeping production costs under $65 million.  The launch of HBO Max had inspired some hopes that Warner Bros. might allow Zack Snyder to release a director‚Äôs cut of ‚ÄúJustice League,‚Äù leading to a social media campaign dubbed #ReleaseTheSnyderCut. Snyder directed an earlier version of the ill-fated super-team movie and had planned to do some reshoots. However, after his daughter died, he was not able to complete production and was replaced by Joss Whedon, who injected a more light-hearted tone into the final film. Logistically, however, there‚Äôs little appetite at the studio for spending the millions of dollars it would require to finish visual effects and editing work on Snyder‚Äôs version, particularly as ‚ÄúJustice League‚Äù was a commercial disaster.

"Same, but only if it meant Cavill‚Äôs out or that he‚Äôs playing Clark Kent.   I‚Äôm fine with a MBJ Superman flick if he‚Äôd be Val-Zod or Calvin Ellis.",2
"Thanks for this, everything sounds very promising and it seems like Aalter Hamada is the savior of DC Films. The genius behind the scenes.",3
"Always said a superman sequel ain't coming out before 2023, nice to see I was right. It's gonna be a long time till another superman movie comes out. Probably long enough to recast...",1
What are you referring to? Superman?,2
"A Variety article isn't an official WB article made by them and released.  But, ppl trust Variety because they barely fail on their leaks.",3
"As someone pointed out on twitter it's basically click bait. Pull out some old information and mix it in with a couple of things that have been in the news recently - the Snyder Cut and Cavill/Superman - to drive current interest back to their site.  I mean, they rehashed that Mens Health article the other day. Hardly deep industry reporting.",0
They said Abrams company producing not Abrams directing. I'm still holding out hope that JJ will personally direct a new Superman movie for us!,2
greg berlanti is bad producer.,0
"Further, the RTSC info directly contradicts Mark Hughes‚Äô Forbes article in terms of cost to complete, etc.",2
It‚Äôs exactly that.,2
"Calvin Ellis. He‚Äôs said before if he plays Superman, it‚Äôll be that version.",1
You can have both.  Just don‚Äôt need to connect it with every other scene.,1
Nah I want a shared universe,2
I don‚Äôt really think they‚Äôll act based on what *you* desire.,1
YES! So much potential.   Hopefully this means Billy Crudup is back too.,1
"It tells us that GLC is still a priority, which was pretty doubtful after they announced the series on HBO Max, so it‚Äôs nice to hear that at least.",3
Basically yes.,1
"Even worse, it feels like really outdated info and possibly even what the writer wants to see.",1
"Just not Jordan. I want Clark Kent, no other Superman.",3
But what have they committed to in this article? It barely talks about anything coming up in concrete terms. Plus the article specifically mentions how Hamada changed the fact they were rushing to try and make release dates that were selected years in advance.,3
This is good PR. It's a positive article despite what you are taking from it.,2
"You do know that WB are the ones leaking this story right? ""Insiders"" are actually ppl at the studio who don't want their name out there.",1
Black superman has actually appeared in Wally West Flash Forward that is currently going on right now.,1
It also completely and totally ignores Black a Adam despite us knowing for a fact the movie is coming out before any other ‚Äúin development‚Äù film in the article.,3
That quote comes from the guy at BoxOffice.com not WB.,2
"I mean...that was a huge reason why everything went to crap. Outside of character assassination they just thought emptying out the toy chest in one film was going to work out.   Batman v Superman could‚Äôve been great if it had just been about you know, Batman v Superman. Why were there extended vision scenes setting up plotlines that had nothing to do with the main story? Why was Doomsday used in the SECOND film? Why was there a Youtube trailer showing the Justice League? Why were there like 3 different subplots?",2
Jordan just sent a pitch. There are tons of silly pitches sent to studios all the time. Doesn‚Äôt mean it will happen.,3
DC movies have been doing really good under Walter Hamada,3
This article feels like Kroll having his way with the fandom.,1
If this article had anything of substance it would be quoting higher level sources than it is. Truth is-the trades aren‚Äôt as well connected with DC as they used to be before Hamada took over.,0
...said they currently have no plans. Plans can change ü§û,2
"To say it‚Äôs a pipe dream at this point is an achievement in stupidity. Probably the same guy that wrote that hit article some time ago, the Fritz guy.",1
The trench movie is gonna be low budget. It‚Äôs a horror movie. Not connected to DCEU. Horror movies by WB are always successful.,1
"Why wouldn‚Äôt they make more solo villain movies after the success of ‚ÄòJoker‚Äô? And it‚Äôs hardly as if that‚Äôs all the article is suggesting. It talks about R-rated movies in terms of ‚ÄòThe Suicide Squad‚Äô, not just solo villain movies. And they have the option for spin-offs if characters are received well. I think it‚Äôs unfair of you to complain about them being reactionary when the article talks about Flash, Black Adam, Green Lantern and Superman as future movies, not just more ‚Äònitty-gritty solo villain movies‚Äô.",1
"Imagine only watching Snyder DC films that you don‚Äôt even realized Geoff Johns is involved in Titans which is anything but ‚Äúlight hearted Marvel‚Äù and that Berlanti has produced Titans, Doom Patrol, and the first two seasons of Arrow",2
"Lmao, what did Johns have to do with Suicide Squad? You Snyder folks keep changing your fanfiction and Boogeymen. Also, considering any Green Lantern movie would pull from his GL run, it makes sense for Johns to make it Also, what exactly is wrong with Superman helping old ladies across the street.",1
Cavill and Johnson have the same people making their careers happen. If DJ is a big part of DC moving forward I could see the two both being involved. Hell maybe Johnson will throw his weight around and say that they need to wrap up Cavill's contract and play nice or he walks after the one movie.,3
"It‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs out, they don‚Äôt want him back. The mention of Michael B. Jordan should make that clear. He can say what he wants in public until the next actor is cast. In the same way Affleck said he‚Äôd do anything for Reeves. It‚Äôs just PR.",2
Ya we‚Äôve been down this road before. There‚Äôs no way they hold off this long and come back with the same actor. Unless something falls into place fast he‚Äôs clearly done.,3
"I partly agree, but I personally think that Cavill was out for a brief period, maybe contract negotiations weren't going well (hence why they approached Michael B Jordan), but they managed to get everything sorted out and now Henry Cavill is still firmly our Superman.   Wouldn't surprise me if the Rock had something to do with Cavill staying on tbh.",3
Wouldn‚Äôt be too sure. That‚Äôs bs.,0
The show still has a big budget to the tune of 100M+,2
"I mean, I highly doubt any studio has ever said ""We got a box-office bomb on our hands""",3
But isn't Hamada a bad guy for blocking the Snyder Cut?,0
"Wtf are you talking about?. So you'd rather them sub creative authenticity for the sake of 'beating Marvel'   In other words, let it be mediocre and make loads of money, rather than let it stand out and be related to the tone of characters and story as should be intended.",2
>That means DC won‚Äôt beat Marvel at the box office for 2021   That was never going to happen tbh..Spiderman 3 will easily cross 1 billion and Thor & Doctor strange will definitely Overperform as they are riding Endgame bump ..they might even cross 1 billion on the other hand from the dc side only batman has the chance to cross 1 billion,3
It‚Äôs just what they heard.,2
Ugh... Michael B Jordan as Superman...,2
That'd actually be really good.,3
But Trevor Noah has that job now and less funny,3
Variety isn't leaking anything. They're a well-respected trade source. They're just reporting what the trades and insiders have said.,3
"Ah, I see! In any case,  I‚Äôm excited for a potentially good GL film haha!",1
JJ would just remake the 78 movie and call it a day lol,1
He produced Titans and Doom Patrol. I have confidence.,3
He is literally one of the most successful producer working today.,3
"He is literally pulling off crisis on infinite earths on TV by actually showing 3 superman including kingdom come, 2 batman, montior, antimonitor and whatnot. the shows definitely went downhill after few seasons but he's still TV's Kevin feige",2
Furthermore pertaining to the SC- It's difficult to fathom that Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck would SUDDENLY come out in support last week and have this be the result. Plus Jason's enthusiasm and very vocal support. Doesn't feel right.,2
Hypothetically what changes about Clark Kent if he‚Äôs not white? Just like Arthur Dent being Polynesian.  Like say Steve Rogers - if he‚Äôs black or a minority that changes his story since he grew up in the 40‚Äôs. If Black Panther is a different race it changes his story.  Clark Kent being Hispanic (like DJ Cotrona who was cast as Supes back in the day) or black or whatever else doesn‚Äôt change Clark‚Äôs story any more than Nick Fury being interchangeable as white or black.  Implying that he can‚Äôt be Clark because Clark has predominantly been white is illogical considering Aquaman is predominantly white in comics and everyone loves Mamoa as Aquaman.  Were you having this much of a racist tantrum over Mamoa?,0
Jordan can be Clark Kent... there‚Äôs nothing about Clark Kent that says he has to be white dude.,0
"I prefer Michael B Jordan, he's a better actor (and more sexy in my opinion) and it would be cool to have the inmigrant alien being black instead of the story of a ""white american"" that turns out to be an alien",0
"I wasn't saying they committed to anything, and infact that's my whole point. This article mostly lists potential possibilities, and very little concrete information, which I think is bad PR because it continues to make them look disorganized. I was just saying we really don't hear much about Marvel movies unless it is pretty much a sure thing or it comes directly from them and that allows them to appear more organized. Every studio pitches things and has plans that fall through, but we hear about all of WB's fails or what ifs more than others and I just think they to try to control that more",0
"We can agree to disagree on whether this is good PR or not. But I wasn't saying it was a negative article, my whole point is that this is another speculative article with little concrete information which I think is bad PR because its laying out things that may not come to fruition and continues to make it seem like they are disorganized. I was just saying WB really needs to control what gets put out there and what doesn't. I think it would be better for them if the only thing that really gets out to the public is stuff that is very likely too happen and not a bunch of these articles listing potential possibilities",1
Cool. I haven't been following comics in recent years.,1
That's because The Hollywood Reporter got the exclusive to that story and already broke it a couple weeks ago.,1
It's not Kroll's article,1
Yeah it‚Äôs seems like this story is rumor roundup they are trying to run as a exclusive.,1
"I mean, it _is_ connected to the DCEU, but it still a horror movie. It probably won't feature Aquaman but it's still set in the same universe as that movie.",3
From what I've heard it is gonna be connected to the DCEU,2
Of course it will be connected as matter of facts wait see character form that movie popping up in Aquaman 2.,1
"Yes! I mean such exquisite quality in story telling. Have a day off!. I like to watch things that don't require constantly having to fill the gaps up in my mind and watching constant out of character storylines which consist of about 7/8's episodes to a season.   Imagine not realising Geoff Johns wanted to inject so much humour into early DC films that he wanted to make them like marvel, that he then suddenly finds success in titans??. FYI, I dislike season 2, I loved season 1, that is why I touch upon his inability to write scripts and screenplays as well as Berlanti, arrow is a hot mess and doom patrol had 3-4 episodes which were a complete waste of time, as well as the villains traits getting old way too quickly, it was so canned it was painful.",0
"And you people who constantly feel the need to cover for him are delusional. It's common knowledge he was the one who was forcing the reshoots of suicide squad, which resulted in that mish mash story and tone.   Giving a comic book writer full creativity of a M O V I E is completely different story writing. Johns doesn't have any knowledge or the science of movie writing.",1
"I think Affleck and Cavill are different though. Yeah, Ben left even though het got on stage at SDCC 2017 and said he was still Batman, but you could tell the reception of BvS and his own personal problems burned him out of any enthusiasm of the role. Reports that he was leaving came out as early as early 2017.   Cavill however DOES want to stay. Even though he's gotten burned in his portrayals, the dude still loves the character (named his dog Kal lol), and even said recently that people should stay tuned for what he has planned.",3
Who said they don't want him? Michael B Jordan just sent a pitch dude. Studio didn't contact him.,3
"Jordan pitched something, they didn't exactly reach out to him.",1
"To be honest, I don't much mind if he's in or out - if he's out, he might get to be James Bond. Collect all the famous characters! :D - but what bothers me is if he's out why are WB so damn weak they can't just say so? They had a perfect opportunity when that pay negotiation crap went down.  ""We'd like to thank Henry for all the work he's done for us, but we're excited about what the future of DC films holds."" Easy. Done. Suck up the fan rage for a few weeks and move on.  But nope, they went ahead and used Cavill Superman in Shazam afterwards. They want their cake and eat it - use the goodwill he generates, but not give him any opportunity to prove the character himself.",1
Goodness you‚Äôre oversimplifying things.,1
Yeah he‚Äôs done. I do feel bad for the dude because he was the least of the franchise‚Äôs problems at the time but when something isn‚Äôt working it isn‚Äôt working and unfortunately he joins Routh as another Superman taken behind the shed to be put down.,0
"The article also suggests that any movement on the film wouldn‚Äôt happen until at least 2023. He‚Äôll be about 41 then. No way they, for all intents and purposes, reboot Superman with him being that old. I think he‚Äôs done and has been for a long time.",2
That would be hilarious to see though,3
They don‚Äôt say it out loud but you can tell a studious confidence about films. The fact that they‚Äôre advertising so far out should be a good sign.,3
"any time a new idea for a new Terminator movie arises, this should be the thought tho",1
"The first *Suicide Squad* was extremely popular, and *Joker* made a billion so who knows. You also have tons of people who will go see *Black Adam* for The Rock, and that movie already sounds wild from the recent rumors we‚Äôve heard so I could see it doing extremely well.   Then again, you‚Äôre right that everything Marvel has in 2021 is going to be huge as well. We‚Äôll see.",2
"Even Shang-Chi has a chance at a billion, seeing as it‚Äôs the first ever Asian superhero movie",2
We have Batman back. If its good it has the potential to be the highest grossing movie between Marvel and DC.,1
We‚Äôll never see now.   Though marvel is declining,0
There is a black superman it wouldn't be Clark kent,1
almost spit my coffee out of laughing at ur comment.,2
As long as Henry is our guy then I‚Äôm good with whatever JJ does!,1
Perhaps all these sources and all that was from before the whole thing went down?,2
"Especially with Affleck doing everything in his power to distance himself from Batman, DC, Justice and BvS.",2
He is literally shown to have fair skin colour since the beginning,3
"Not explicitly no, but an adopted black kid raised in rural Kansas would have a very, very different upbringing and would definitely experience the worst sides of humanity on a personal level as a child, which reasonably would mean that *that* Clark would be a very different person.   I‚Äôm fine with him as Kal-El, but then I‚Äôd prefer if they‚Äôd use Calvin Ellis instead. Would give them much more freedom to sculpt exactly the kind of Superman they want as well.",2
"you sound like those people want black superman because superman is white? if you want black superman, they can do crisis on infinite earth",3
"And why should he be black though if diversity is what they want Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean would be better",2
"Besides the skin tone, I don‚Äôt see what difference it would make.",2
You made me laugh right now,2
Because they didn‚Äôt release this as a press statement; it‚Äôs an article from sources.,2
"I will say I agree with you that DC's PR in general is very poor. But I disagree here. From about the middle of 2016 to the end of 2017, there were new films being announced every week it felt like and that made them seem disorganised. But since Walter Hamada took over in January 2018, we barely hear anything official now with regard to new films being announced etc. We know the concrete slate and films that are coming out for the next two years, ending with 'Black Adam' in December 2021. I don't expect them to have 2022 and beyond locked down yet so I think it's fair to have some speculation about the possibilities. And as for what ifs etc., I think you hear just as much speculation and leaks about Marvel from guys like Jeremy Conrad, Charles Murphy and DanielRPK as you do for DC.",1
"WB can't really control what trades publish. None of this is official either. Other franchises...including Star Wars...have articles like this written about them all the time. Marvel not so much cause they announce what they're doing years prior. The only things in this article that are speculative are the Superman and GL stuff. We know that WW84, BOP, SS2 and The Batman are all happening. I'm just saying this is at least not gloom and doom compared to what we've seen written in the past few years on DC.",3
"...that‚Äôs not how it works. That‚Äôs not how any of this works. These movie trades don‚Äôt just, like, not report on something because somebody else got there first a few weeks ago.",1
So you'd think it would be mentioned in the studio's upcoming plans.,1
Ok. Saw his name on the byline.,1
"EXCLUSIVE- DC is working on a bunch of stuff, possibly involving superheroes   Give me a staff writing job now, Variety.",1
The mental gymnastics people go through to debunk the DCEU still *is* a thing don‚Äôt seem to have a limit.,2
How would that connect to DCEU tho?,0
"I‚Äôm sure he wants to stay and is publicly mentioning that he‚Äôs still Superman because it‚Äôs technically true, until it‚Äôs not. I just don‚Äôt believe the studio actually wants him back. Regardless of how we feel about the films he was in, I love Man of Steel, the general audience wasn‚Äôt a fan of his portrayal and the box office receipts show that.  I just think the studio wants to move on entirely from him.",3
"You could argue the fact that they even took a pitch as left field as Michael B Jordan playing an alternate version of Superman (presumably), that it shows how little faith they have in the HC version of the character. Why take the meeting at all if they always intended to stick with Henry?",2
Thankfully he‚Äôs got loads of potential as an actor and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll keep finding good work.,1
"I don't understand this mindset _at all_... 41 is not that old. Even so, there's no reason why you have to reboot the character completely instead of just soft rebooting the franchise like Marvel did with the Thor franchise. Clark Kent ages like me and you.   There's this weird mindset in certain circles that if something isn't working, throw it away and try again... instead of figuring it _why_ it isn't working. Reboots hardly ever fix things.",3
"The age is less of a problem with a guy such a Superman, given the nature of his powers.   Jackman played Wolverine until he 49. Dwayne Johnson will be 49 when *Black Adam* comes out. A soft reboot with a 41 year old Cavill is far from a problem, as long as he stays in shape.",1
"I mean, Cavill literally said he's still Superman, but sure, if you don't want to believe it's been resolved that's up to you.",2
>The first *Suicide Squad* was extremely popular  Yeah but I think it kind of left bad taste in people's mind & the gap between the 1st and 2nd movie is 5 years hopefully it'll still make 800m+   I'm also hopeful about BA.. nonetheless 2021 is going to be a Great year for CBM fans,2
If they manage to really bank on china market I'm sure it will hit a billion.,2
I predict to you be  But you need more than that to beat marvel. DC is very close to beating marvel.,0
I disagree. I think knowing how smart Feige is he‚Äôs gonna go fucking nuts with Phase 4 and beyond. While everybody thinks they‚Äôve peaked with Endgame it allows to go crazier and riskier than they‚Äôve ever gone before. Besides it‚Äôs not a competition DC has some great things coming up and they don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúreplace‚Äù Marvel. Just keep making films that are good and people want to see,1
"*their last movie is literally the highest grossing movie of all time, they have like nine movies and seven TV shows lined up*  ‚ÄúDeclining‚Äù",0
Plot twist: He brings back Nicholas Cage as Superman,1
"And so did Aquaman, were you this upset about Mamoa?",0
Oh.. you‚Äôre one of those guys. Yeah have a good day.,0
Yeah Superman is white always been portrayed as such he doesnt need a race bait change. Will Smith has turned down superman in the past cus he said that Superman is white. Its the same as we wouldnt wanna make a film with a white cyborg or white black panther.,2
I'm just saying that his storyline about being an inmigrant alien is more touching if he's POC,0
"People can‚Äôt even accept a black Superman. They aren‚Äôt going to accept Asians who are practically nonexistent in films. We are just getting better representation for blacks in films and people are slowly embracing it. No way Asian superman would get better reception. The closest we got was Dean Cain and he looked white enough to where people didn‚Äôt care, also this was before the whole ‚Äúanti-SJW/woke culture‚Äù that Ben Shapiro and the cool kids philosophers gangs begun indoctrinating into American culture.",1
"Chinese, Indian, Japanese and Korean are nationalities not races, you went to school?",0
My point was that just because they didn't mention something that was already recently and widely covered by another outlet doesn't mean they're wrong that WB is not moving forward with plans to release the Snyder Cut. The person who responded to my original post seemed to be suggesting that just because they didn't talk about Black Adam that invalidates the articles comments on RTSC. It does not.,1
"There's tons of it in this subreddit. People believe want they want to believe, even if the evidence mounts against them.",1
"The Trench was literally in Aquaman, and it's been described as a spin-off of Aquaman rather than a stand-alone movie like Joker.",3
"It‚Äôs literally a spin-off of Aquaman, so it‚Äôs in the DCEU.",2
"Oh definitely. We have agreement in GA reception, but imo Cavill is still salvageable, and I hope WB sees that too. Here's to hoping that The Rock will push WB on Cavill's behalf.",2
"They could have just held a meeting to appease one of their bigger stars, or decide that it could be different enough to do it as a spin-off.",1
They also took a pitch from Christopher McQuarrie and Cavill for a Superman movie. It just came out that Mark Ruffalo pitched Hulk vs Wolverine to Marvel. Just caused they listened doesn‚Äôt mean it will happen.,1
"I dont know how you got downvoted for this lol, but I agree. After watching Man of Steel and Man from UNCLE, I could tell Cavill could make it big.",1
"While I agree 41 isn‚Äôt old, this film would essentially be Superman I. All that happened prior to Justice League etc most likely won‚Äôt be mentioned ever again due to its reception. So you can‚Äôt really start a franchise with a 41 year old, it just doesn‚Äôt happen.",1
Him wanting to be Superman doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs resolved. Ofc he‚Äôll say he‚Äôs still Superman. Firmly in his heart and eyes and the heart and eyes of several fans he‚Äôs still Superman but that doesn‚Äôt mean things have been resolved.,2
">Yeah but I think it kind of left bad taste in people's mind  For critics, maybe, but the casual audience LOVED Suicide Squad, and if you have a movie with some of the biggest stars from the first movie, combine that with ""From the Writer/Director of Guardians of the Galaxy,"" I think it's very probable that movie will be a hit.",1
I think they will make more when it comes to money but quality wise we will be ahead by the end of 2021,0
It kinda is a competition. People will only go to theaters so many Times a year.,0
"I mean, by definition that is racism... Saying a character will be lesser solely because of their skin color.",1
Lol! That‚Äôs the only time I‚Äôve been good a superman movie didn‚Äôt get made!,1
Oh... you're one of those guys who would rather have characters race-bent rather than seeing original good characters who are also POC.,3
"And you're one of those people. Dude, the whole point of Clark Kent is that he can blend as the stereotypical midwestern farm boy. If you want a Black Kryptonian character, then let's get DC to make a new character with unique traits and his own personality. You wanna know why people love Miles Morales? Because he's not just Hispanic Peter Parker. He's his own character.",2
I think what he‚Äôs saying is that a white farmer raised in the heart of Kansas would have a very different perspective of the world growing up if he were subject to the challenges of being Black in America.,2
smh. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1
"I see what you‚Äôre saying, but I don‚Äôt quite get it. Most comic book characters go through changes in their adaptation to the movies. Both Marvel and DC have great current examples of that. Most of the audience take it in stride, and they enjoy the story that‚Äôs then built on screen for what it is. I feel a change like this is in league with some of the bigger changes that you see. It‚Äôs like changing a backstory.  I really do get it, I think fans should be able to push back like they do with every other detail without fear of being called racists as well.   For me, I‚Äôm really just hoping for a great set of storytelling, I think Cavill is the man for the job, but it sounds troubling atm.",0
Black superman is as touching as white black panther,2
They talk at length about The Batman despite everyone under the sun talking about it lately. Same with JJ Abrams. He‚Äôs been the subject of every clickbait article from here to the sun.,1
You‚Äôre right there‚Äôs always hope. It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see how this all shakes out.,2
"You're not starting a franchise with a 41 year old, you're continuing it with one. The franchise started with Man of Steel. Any movie featuring Cavill would be a sequel to that, rather than Justice League.",3
"Look, at this stage, Warner Bros themselves could come out and say that Cavill is still Superman and someone on this subreddit would still claim he's not and give some convoluted reason as to why.   It's like the Snyder Cut all over again. Even when the people involved in it said it existed, people still put their fingers in the ears and claimed it didn't. It's the same principle.",0
"The Rock is going to get him back, because the wants him back and the Rock gets what the Rock wants. IFFFFF YOU SMELLLLLLELELELELOW WHAT TH- you get it",0
"Quality is subjective, money isn‚Äôt   But if Batman is number 1 then DC will basically be at Marvel‚Äôs level",0
Would you watch a recast cyborg or black panther played by a white guy,0
I mean with Cage it would be obvious that Clark is in fact an alien,1
"He didn‚Äôt say he‚Äôd rather have characters race bent, it‚Äôs just not a dealbreaker. Most comic to movie character have differences/ new tales and nobody bats an eye, they invest and get into the story that‚Äôs being built on the screen.",1
Yeah I get your point. I think whats the most annoying is we know for a fact that WB would make a Black Superman just to be diverse and get that diversity money.,0
Like you said yourself it‚Äôll be a soft reboot so yes you are starting the franchise again. We forget that Man of Steel was also divisive although I personally loved it. So I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôd be anyway they mention any call backs to that film,2
"> Quality is subjective, money isn‚Äôt  Considering we are making different types of movies judging should be easier",0
"You know they wouldn't.  You also know that they'll either lie and say they would, or start ranting about how 'blackness' is inherent to the character.",0
Yes but the core character is still the same.  Changing the characters race to have more representation is being happy with getting table scraps.,2
"Thor Ragnarok is a soft reboot, but it's still a sequel to Thor the Dark World, the previous movie in the franchise (which is more divisive than Man of Steel), and resolves plot points from that movies.",3
Huh? I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre trying to say.,0
Point exactly bro,0
Like Mamoa as Aquaman then?,0
"Why wouldn‚Äôt the core character be the same? Why can‚Äôt that be powerful? You don‚Äôt think that it would be incredible for hundreds of thousands of kids to see Superman portrayed in that way. I wouldn‚Äôt call it table scraps.   Superman is a unique character in this discussion because he‚Äôs an alien from another world, he‚Äôs not only a white American or an African American.   I personally would choose Cavill if I had my choice though.",0
"Whilst it was a soft reboot, they also didn‚Äôt wait this extended an amount of time before releasing the film. It‚Äôs an apples and oranges comparison",2
"Mamoa looks like a white dude due being part Irish, German and Hawaiian.",1
"Superman is a white character.  I would much rather see a new character, that is a person of color, get the chance to shine.  Any actor who portrays Superman that isn't white won't be called ""Superman"" it'll be ""Oh the black Superman"".",2
"I think it's less comparison and more ""If Thor can do it, so can Superman but in its own way"". Rebooting the superman character itself seems like a waste to me especially because of all the development Superman got throughout MoS - JL. I feel like it wouldn't be too hard to pick up where we left off for Superman because JL ended at a part where Superman can start new with his life, so there's a lot of directions we can go that isn't rebooting.",1
Fair enough. If that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre saying then that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre saying.,0
"Not sure what else there is to say.  Again this conversation would never happen to a comic character that is a POC, it only happens if the character is historically white.  Then for some reason it's OK to change years worth of history to force diversity.",2
"But again, characters are changed all the time to be adapted to film(even years worth of history), including things as significant as their backstories. Some fans fight these changes and I think they have every right to, and should have the fight to here without being accused of being racist. That said, many go on to be celebrated for what they are- a version of the character in a different type of media.  I don‚Äôt expect you have much more to say other than what‚Äôs been said. And that‚Äôs fine! I feel comfortable with my responses as well.",1
"Show me 1 character, a main comic character, that was race bent and it was celebrated.",1
Sucks... I liked the one from Dawn Of Justice though.,3
"I would prefer the version from BvS... this is ofc very unpolished but I think Steppenwolf would simply look better if he was stomping around in something you couldn't tell was armor... or something that was clearly some kind of biomechanical outfit. The design here (as it is) reminds me of Zod's armor which also looked very over-designed.  The one we got however I would say was just boring to look at, not to mention ugly, because what he was, was a very big dude in a suit of armor. CGI could have done a far better job with his face (or better yet just put someone elses face on it), but I keep wondering why he'd even expose his face like that when he's armored from head to toe otherwise. (Heck, do like Faora's suit and make it close up if needed, that would help.)",3
"Imo, it‚Äôs worse than what we got. Steppenwolf should have been practical with CGI enhancements.   Something like [this ](https://www.instagram.com/p/BikoQ_TngTQ/?igshid=graskelwvfhw) is what they should have done. Similar to General Zod with a Armoured suit but not a full CGI replacement. A lot of people forget that in MoS General Zod‚Äôs suit was CGI.",3
"I loved the idea of a very ""alien"" apokolyps with a demonic alien looking steppenwolf. Even fill CGI it looked better than what we got since if you go far enough there is no uncanny valley.",3
"The more I see clips and photos and art from ""The Snyder Cut"" the more I wonder if he was making one movie or ten.",2
"Damn, I really REALLY like this design of Steppenwolf! Loved his design in BvS as well!",3
Imo his original design was sick. Unfortunately the only complete footage we have of the original Steppenwolf is in BvS.,3
Needs more colour.,2
"This is, well, a previz scene. He was never going to look exactly like this. That said, I still think the BvS design is the best.",3
I'd pay to watch the SnyderCut even if it's fully like this. If anyone from WB is reading this I'm letting y'all know there are a lot of people who will want to see the movie the way it is. So literally a win - win for the studio.,3
"Why didn‚Äôt they just make him look like Steppenwolf? Lol. Gives us the Trinity near ripped straight from the comics, but then Steppenwolf looked super weird.",2
I loved Snyder's vision mostly but I dont like this design.,1
Not every change is a bad one. Tbh not much changed.,2
"Aside from the fingers and toes, I think it‚Äôs cool. Now I would have preferred they stick closer to comics but I think what they should have done is kept BOTH designs. The theatrical design be how he normally appears to people, and then the BvS design be his godly form/transformation.",3
They did everything in the worst possible way with this movie,2
"I don‚Äôt understand why in a movie where all the other characters are colored so the pop off the screen, including the CGI Parademons, Steppenwolf‚Äôs main color scheme was gray/silver. What‚Äôs wrong with making him black and red like the comics?",2
It's too busy looking.,3
Is that supposed to be armor or his body?,1
I think I saw Steppenwolf wearing shades at the end. That was a sick instant transmission.,1
I like this design more than the theatrical one but I still would like if it had red highlights in his armor the all grey color scheme makes him look somewhat generic imo,1
That‚Äôs terrible. What we got wasn‚Äôt good but it was a lot better than that generic CGI monster that might as well be a Dark Souls boss.,3
Who tf at WB interfered? I just wanna talk..,2
Looks like a Michael Bay Transformer.,2
"WB apparently thought he was ""too scary"" lol",1
How do you know that this is the design Snyder wanted but WB forced to change it?,1
"I‚Äôm not a Snyder fan, but I gotta say the real fault is with WB and their embarrassing incompetence they have with the embarrassment of riches they squander in literally all DC properties.  As a Marvel Cinematic Universe fanboy, I gotta admit that if WB played their cards right a DC Universe would easily be just as great (if not better than) the MCU.",1
"Better than the final shit we got, but still, I don't get why they choose Steppenwolf (yeah, to tease Darkseid whatever) and even if they did, why they didn't go with the easier and way better human look of the comics.   Steppenwolf is a supporting character and no threat to the League, even without Superman. I think Brainiac would be better and they could still tease Darkseid.",1
It‚Äôs better. He‚Äôs actually intimidating here and alien looking.,1
"I enjoyed more that clip alone than the whole theatrical cut, i would not mind see the original cut even in that state.",1
WB made the right choice. Concept art for that design looked horrible.,2
"I honestly hate it. In my opinion, the TC design is *slightly* better, but they both suck lol",3
This looks a hell of a lot better.,1
"This design here sucks imo. The JL design was good but, the cgi wasn‚Äôt strong at all.",2
What the hell that looks horrid is it so hard to make him look like he does in the comics? It would probably save money in the process. The junk we got looks way more intricate and complicated than his real look.,2
"I prefer a more human looking design like in the movie, but I think the movie's design and cgi both could have been much better.",1
I like this one me better,1
I think this would have been better,1
Throw the whole movie away. Why can‚Äôt they just give us what we want? Justice league was garbage.,1
Both designs are awful. This version looks like a dumb grey metal Transformer from the Michael Bay movies.,0
wow looking through the comments i just found out that steppenwolf was in bvs and also found out they made a ultimate edition wow,1
"I don't love it, but considering what we got...",1
Slightly better (miraculously) Although we all know how it would turned out in the end (crappy CGI),1
It doesnt make sense fo him to have blue eyes,1
"I see why they changed his design to a more human look, because the one in BvS, concept art that's online and this previz, he looks like a monster and would probably just be seen as another Doomsday.  On top of that, their reasoning might have been that you, as a viewer, can't really see him emote because of that look, but the version we saw in theaters was thinly written, so it didn't really make a difference.   I don't know which one I would prefer. Maybe a cross between the two of them or a more polished version of the film, but having another monster figure without any sort of depth to it that just wants to destroy stuff would have been really bland.",1
"Looks like the main henchman from Thor 2 to me. You know, the one that goes berserker mode and kills a lot of Asgardians",1
I'm actually glad we never got this design,1
This looks like a late 90s music video.  [For example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlUKcNNmywk),1
"I don't like this look, but I don't like the final one either.",1
Just another grey big thing.,1
Steppenwolf is so distractingly god awful looking that I‚Äôm convinced the rotten tomato score would go up by 10 to 15 percent. Still other issues but it would be so much more enjoyable if it wasn‚Äôt SO GOD DAMN FUCK UGLY BAD! It enrages me how bad he looks in that movie,1
His head looks like Thanos' ship.,1
"I get that it's probably one of the more goofy looking takes, but I wish they had at least incorporated more of the original Kirby design. Maybe mix that with the Earth 2 version.  But I take it from this then that this is one of the scenes that wasn't changed much in the theatrical cut.",1
He looks like a Decepticon,1
ü§Æ ü§Æ ü§Æ,1
I like what we got more,1
"This is so bad, he‚Äôs just a big CGI monster and looks so bland. He just looked like the comics and  been a fleshed our character.  I will never understand why Synder fans love the this so much.",1
I watched that while listening to Sandstorm and that was cool,0
The dark lord Sauron.,0
"I loved the BvS one. He really did look like a fucked-up alien from deep in outer space, which I **loved**.",3
"Same, DoJ had a tight design.",3
Isn‚Äôt it the same design?,3
"That was a ‚Äúhologram‚Äù of sorts though. Idk, I didn‚Äôt **hate** the design of the one from the TC, but this would have been better for sure",1
Literally the same as previs.,1
I mean in the comics he‚Äôs pretty much just a man in armor. Imo the BvS design was too similar to Doomsday as he just looked like a huge spiky monster.,3
"Not just Zod and the Kryptonians in Man of Steel. They also kinda replicated that in Aquaman and the Atlanteans specifically [King Nereus](https://imgur.com/a/2z6Py49). The Steppenwolf in the comics isn't even that tall. Like Kyptonians, they look more like Humans with a few slight exceptions like Darkseid and maybe Kalibak. They don't really need to make them look like ""aliens"".",3
"Having something look human that isn't human doesn't make sense. He also looks like aries or one of the gods here (in your link). I think the alien approach makes way more sense, and looks bad ass. The version we got looked like a pantomime villain.",3
"Good enough, but I think a completely surreal approach would raise the stakes in the movie. Having an alien actually look like an alien makes sense rather than just a human who supposedly knows English perfectly.",3
thats the only valid answer to all the different designs.,2
"Yes, making him alien looking is exactly what would make him more memorable and scary in contrast to him being a human.",3
"He had the whole vision planned out. Someone asked him if things had gone different would we have gotten Flashpoint and he replied ""Better"".",2
Let us hope we get this or the BvS design in the Snyder Cut.,1
"Yes, some red shades would be nice.",2
Snyder said on Vero that Steppenwolf was gonna look like this before it was changed.,0
How is it a win?,2
steppenwolf supposed to look like alien in snyderverse. snyderverse is meant originally as elseworld stories like nolanverse. problem came after dc comics fans nagging wb to change snyderverse into comic accurate but wb listen to blogger who never read comic andjosstice league is the  final result,0
Now this I can get onboard with.,1
"I lolled so hard at this, I feel you haha",1
because they change design at the least minutes to comic design but to add colors in the last minutes can cause some issues if some of colorist forgot to add in red.,0
"Yes, similar to Cyborg.",1
"Haha, perfect ""deal with it"" moment.",1
"Yes, I think there are so many places you can add the red highlights. Definitely red highlights are needed.",1
"Generic CGI monster??, and what we got wasn't?. You're loco.",0
Oh boy. XD,1
Yeah lmao,1
Snyder said on Vero that Steppenwolf was gonna look like this before WB told him to change it. He even talked about this on his BvS screening he did last year I guess.,2
"The human look wouldn't have looked scary, and there have been a lot of human-looking villains in the MCU, X-Men movies, Spiderman movies, Nolan trilogy, so this would have been a nice change. Every comic had a different take on the character, the new 52 had a different take on Steppenwolf as well, the same way, Zack had a different take on Steppenwolf as well. Nolan had a totally different take on the Joker as well as Bane, so we should be glad that directors try to be creative.   As for why Steppenwolf was chosen, mainly because of how demonic his design looks. But part of the reason is what you already know that he is connected to Darkseid and the other New Gods. Brainiac would have been a great antagonist for MoS 2, maybe they had plans for Brainiac to be in MoS 2 and that is why they didn't use him in JL. Zack also wanted to end his DCEU at JL 3 by completing the whole Darkseid saga.",0
"Yes, he looks like he can make adults pee their pants. I asked some of the people who aren't away of superhero movies to tell me what they think of this creature, and all of them gasped ""Oh god"", they said they were scared and wouldn't want to see it again - they were all adults, one of them my mom.",1
"Same, add the previz footage over the scenes that haven't been CGI'd properly, give as an assembly cut with somewhat unfinished CGI and previz footage fused together. But I feel that will only make people want the actual cut.",1
‚ÄúThey both suck lol‚Äù  This reaction is exactly why WB should have just gone with the artists‚Äô vision.,0
"Yes, badass, scary, and alien. Really shows you that shit is about to go down.",1
Likewise.,1
"What is ""throw the whole movie away"" even supposed to mean at this point",1
"Pretty common knowledge. But definitely see the Ultimate Edition, it's beautiful.",1
"This is a previz footage, it was still in development. If you watch the whole video, he has red eyes, and afterward they don't use red eyes.",1
"According to Ciaran Hinds, Steppenwolf would have been a grounded character, he said he worked too hard on the movie only to see a different movie in the theaters. Previz footage isn't the final take, more or less the design would have been like this with slight changes and his character would have depth like General Zod, and Lex Luther.",1
"Yes, I remember him, honestly loved that design of the henchman.",1
"Yeah, previz footage is just done to get a sense of what a scene should look like, it's like a blueprint for a movie.",1
That‚Äôs usually what pre-vis cg looks like there guy.,1
"Haha, yeah. He looked like a Saturday morning Didney cartoon villain.",1
Kirby's design would be nice for Saturday morning cartoons not this movie.,0
SAME. I love the spikes on his chest.,2
Start a kickstarter to fund the original design. I'll bring my monies.,2
"That's exactly what I wrote a minute ago. That BvS design and what we see here really makes him look like a beast.   A more comic accurate version would have been the way to go, if they fleshed his character out.",3
"And whichever design you favour can come down to whenever or not you like the notion that the New Gods look like humans... actually if Steppenwolf had just been a guy in a suit, I would expect a lot more comparisons to Ares in armor, which wasn't brilliant either.",1
That design in bvs was a hologram no? No way Steppenwolf was physically there already lol,1
> Having something look human that isn‚Äôt human doesn‚Äôt make sense   Who wants to tell this guy about Superman and an entire race of aliens called Kryptonians that happen to conveniently look 100% like human beings.,3
Stephenwolf is a god tho so making him look like an alien made no sense.,3
"New Gods are not considered ""aliens"" or ""sci Fi aliens"". They are considered ""gods"". They are like the Olympian Gods or the Old Gods in DC like Zeus, Ares, etc. that also look like Humans. Of course, DC have ""aliens"" that don't look like Humans and they are commonly seen in the Green Lantern Corps. Kilowog, for example, is an ""alien"" that doesn't look like a Human.",3
WB probably thought Snyder's Steppenwolf looked too similar to Doomsday and might confuse viewers.,3
> Having an alien actually look like an alien makes sense rather than just a human who supposedly knows English perfectly.  Uhhhh.... I take it you‚Äôre not a big fan of Superman then?,2
"Nah it wouldn‚Äôt. Cool designs won‚Äôt last, only development and story will. Plus, he‚Äôs a typical big grey ugly villain, doomsday and ares were like that and how many people remember them?  Memorable would be someone with good lines, backstory. Someone like Sivana.  Unfortunately, human looking faces and body are the way to go, because it makes them relatable. Like Thanos.",0
"Personally, I prefer it when a filmmaker makes one movie at a time. The more you dilute your attention the worse each of the products come out",1
The BvS and concept art designs actually look demonic and terrifying. I would‚Äôve loved to see that version over the design in the TC that looks like it was ripped straight from a Disney Channel original movie.,3
"agree, my problem with steppenwolf is he need red to shows us his armor",1
In terms of general design. But this is pre-viz. This is unfinished.,2
Snyder said the opposite. The BvS design of the Steppenwulf was not supposed to be used in his version.     [https://heroichollywood.com/steppenwolf-justice-league-zack-snyder/](https://heroichollywood.com/steppenwolf-justice-league-zack-snyder/)    Previsualization often uses early designs on character models.,1
"WB doesn't have to spend a dime, and people will still buy their subscription HBO MAX.",2
"He is talking about the previz video. Just releasing the previz video would be enough for the Snyder Cut, but I think if they release the previz video of the entire movie, people will want the actual thing even more.",2
"The runtime, the CGI, the story, its all so weird and I‚Äôm surprised someone like Joss Whedon was involved",2
I just said what we got was shit. But at least he was at least slightly human and had a face. This is is just a video game boss.,3
I‚Äôd need a diaper that‚Äôs for sure,1
WB recognized that this version sucked. Atleast they tried to make it correct. It didn't come off though.,2
"Exactly, every comic had a different take on Steppenwolf, the same as how Snyder had his own take on Steppenwolf, Batman, Superman etc. Nolan had his own take on the Joker, you never saw a Joker like that before, you never saw Bane like that before in the comics which you saw in the Nolanverse, by the ""it should be like the comics"" rationale, Superman should wear underwear outside in 2019, if you really want to go with the OG comics.",1
"I know, I have an animation degree.",1
"Would you say that for the New Gods in general, or just Steppenwolf?",1
I am in as well.,1
Wow thanks! I definitely like the BvS design more than what we got. Also love the apokolptian priests,3
"It‚Äôs called studio interference, the final design with what we ended up with is awful with regards to what they wanted to originally achieve which was to make a badass looking scary ‚Äòcreature‚Äô",3
"They even had Steppenwolf roar in that BvS scene, which officially makes him just another big spiky CGI monster. It's just too similar, especially mere minutes after seeing Doomsday on the screen.   If I'm being honest, I don't think the character works with either design. Regardless of how he looks, he's just another generic CGI monster hitting the big screen shortly after Doomsday and Ares, who were both generic CGI monsters. On top of that, Steppenwolf doesn't have anything particularly interesting about him in terms of his character. At the end of the day, I would've preferred they foreshadow Darkseid through an entirely different character.",3
Who said he was physically there?,1
"Granted that's embedded as their features.  But giving a bunch of monsters from a planet called apokolips human features is hardly outlandish or attempting to be true to the characters background. I mean, not at all clich√© is it??. Especially the one we got!. Let's give everything human features shall we while, we're at it?.   Martian Manhunter, he is intended to look alien as is Kryptonians to look human. Steppenwolf is intended to look like a menacing being from another planet... Humanising the features makes it look shit and unimaginative.",0
"Superman, the Kryptonians and humans came from a common ancestor is what I heard from Zack Snyder in an interview, Snyder explained why they look the same but have different bodies due to millions of years of environmental factors. The genetic codex in MoS is a human skull, but from when is the question, I think Snyder would have expanded on this in his sequels.",0
">Stephenwolf is a god  That's not to be taken literally, the term is more metaphorical, if that he is 'deemed' or 'perceived' as a god.   He is from the planet apokolips...",1
Is that why darkseid looks like an alien... Cool. Pretty sure it's the opposite.,0
"I disagree, but to each his own.",2
"Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy, Harry Potter's last 4 movies were directed by one director.  When you have a vision, one director is enough.",1
"My thoughts exactly. I can't remember any movie in the entirety of Hollywood to show a proper sentient extraterrestrial being in a movie. The alien from Alien 1979 comes to mind, which really raised the stakes for me, beautiful movie. When I see Star Wars villains, I can't help but think they are just humans who painted themselves, it's so funny to look at them which is why you can't take them seriously.",3
That is what I meant.,0
Who knows what really happened behind the scenes. Just hope the real JL comes out soon.,1
"wb take troll to hard, they should listen to DCEU fans, not blogger",1
"Dude, the one we got looked like a Disney villain from something like snow white or whatever kid fairytale. I'm actually surprised the one we got didn't break out into song.   I'd hardly say the one depicted here was as generic as videogame boss's go. If anything far far more videogame boss's look better than the shit we get on screen. Why want the alien to look human ffs.",0
So they betrayed the artistic integrity of their studio for no reason.,0
"All of them. I mean half of them are wearing underwears and Darkseid, the big daddy is wearing a skirt. They seem too cartoon-ish, wouldn't translate well on the big screen.",0
"Like who though? IMO there's a really limited set of characters that can foreshadow Darkseid and they went with Steppenwolf. Sure, could have done Granny or DeSaad but Steppenwolf makes a lot of sense since he's the general of the armies.",1
Or went with Throne of Atlantis as the first JL. Would have been far better,1
"Lol wait so it‚Äôs okay for Kryptonians to look human because they‚Äôre ‚Äúintended to‚Äù but Steppenwolf can‚Äôt despite the fact [that‚Äôs literally how the character is designed?](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/0/0e/Superman_Vol_4_33_Textless_Variant.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180618163113) Cause he was ‚Äúintended‚Äù to look that way.   That doesn‚Äôt look unimaginative to me. And while I don‚Äôt like the Justice League design, adding a bunch of random spikes and making a busy design reminiscent of a Michael Bay Transformer isn‚Äôt the answer.",3
"It‚Äôs supposed to be taken very literally, not metaphorical. The whole concept starts with ‚ÄúThere was a time when the Old Gods died.‚Äù   Apokalips and New Genesis are part of the Fourth World which arose in place of the destruction of realms like Asgard and the death of their pantheon. They‚Äôre literally New Gods...",3
Yeah I know that. I meant he would be comparable to Thor from the mcu. He is not a literal god. His appearance is pretty much a human.,1
He is a 'New God'.,1
Darkseid looks like a monster because he‚Äôs corrupted by the Omega Force. Before that he was a pretty human looking dude.,2
"That's not what I was getting at. What I'm talking about is the habit of some studios/filmmakers start one movie and use that one movie to set up sequels and spinoffs and prequels and alternate universes. BvS stopped in the middle of it's narrative to go ""wink-wink, nudge nudge look at the other movies we're planning to make!"" rather than just making the one good movie.  Christopher Nolan did ""one for you, one for me"" with WB in between the Dark Knight films. He made one movie at a time and it shows.",2
They should have released the movie they had to begin with,1
"I agree with you, I have never seen such a scary design as Steppenwolf's concept art. Everyone I showed it to who wasn't aware of superhero comics got scared. Doing something so ballsy is what I like about this design. Hopefully we get something like this in the Snyder Cut.",0
"You're right that as far as the usual Apokolips bunch goes, there's a limited pool to choose from, if you want to go the standard route where the bad guy just brings an army and invades Earth Avengers/Transformers style. None of the Apokolips crowd make for particularly compelling big screen villains imo, so maybe another route would've been a better bet than the standard alien army invasion play. Maybe something along the lines of Superman/Batman: Apokolips or a scenario where he's in league with Braniac or something and Braniac just comes for the first strike on Earth. I mean the way they set it up in BvS, it could have even been Lex who makes the first face to face with Apokolips happen.   To me, the only way that Step works in this scenario is if he's just a lackey like the Black Order was for Thanos. Having him lead a movie as the main villain is like giving Ebony Maw his own movie in my eyes. He just doesn't have what it takes to be a compelling primary villain and an actual existential threat, which is shown in the movie itself when Superman rolls up and 1v1's him with ease.",1
">adding a bunch of random spikes and making a busy design reminiscent of a Michael Bay Transformer isn‚Äôt the answer.  Seeing as we're repeating ourselves, neithe ris making it a clich√©, unimaginative, non-intimidating panto villain. Also, does James earl Jones ring any bells?? https://images.app.goo.gl/y4ePSiXoUAFrVKPA8  I think judging it looking 'busy' from an unfinished unrendered video is about as accurate to go by.",0
"Yes that's true and are god's supposed to be depicted as humans?. They come in all forms. One not being from or related to any on our planet would make sense to have resemble nothing like aries or Zeus etc. That is my point. You are likening it to the idea of Zeus etc. But even Anubis, set does not resemble human features..",1
YA but the old gods were just powerful aliens that humans called old gods. What are smokin,1
Hes from another planet bro. Thats a fucking alien.,1
"That would then mean darkseid would be humanised as well...  Lol, do you want it to be like the MCU then?.",1
"Yes, but not like Zeus. Considered old god perhaps.",1
You mean that depiction of him when he has grey skin all over him?.,2
"My bad, I definitely agree with you, but showing the meta human files was a good nod to the symbols and the characters to come. I feel like BvS was very secluded, just its own movie, as you said.   But as for JL, It is too fused together. I feel like after BvS, they should have introduced us to Aquaman and Flash with their solo movies, with Cyborg being introduced as the heart and soul of JL as Cyborg's armor and Steppenwolf's armor are the same thing (the armor of Steppenwolf in the concept arts looks very similar to Cyborg's armor, so there could have been some lore there).",1
"You know what, carry on...",1
">None of the Apokolips crowd make for particularly compelling big screen villains imo, so maybe another route would've been a better bet than the standard alien army invasion pla  EXACTLY. Which is why I was hoping for throne of atlantis",1
"The design looks very similar (though not identical) to the Communion scene rendition. I don‚Äôt like it.   And I don‚Äôt get why you can‚Äôt be as faithful as possible to the design of the character, and let him be intimidating in his actions.",2
"Yeah but Steppenwolf is a god that always looks like a human, not like a giant spiky shark man...",2
What? So Zues and all of them were just aliens? Wonder Woman‚Äôs an alien?,1
"He‚Äôs from the Fourth World, a realm created in the ashes of Ragnarok. It‚Äôs populated by metaphysical beings embodying ideals and virtues. This time just reshaped through the lens of the atomic age. It‚Äôs trans-dimensional mysticism. That‚Äôs fucking gods lol",2
I didn‚Äôt mention anybody except Stephenwolf. I forgot why darkseid doesn‚Äôt look exactly human. I think it‚Äôs because of the omega force. And no I don‚Äôt want it like the mcu. I‚Äôm using it as an example.,2
Read some comics. You are in dire need of some education.,1
"I‚Äôm referring to his [original depiction](https://images.app.goo.gl/DxXj9RiVAFJc7VT68), not what they tried to shift him to after the New52.",2
Because look what happened when you got something that resembled him?. Noone wants Steppenwolf to look like the fucking hound from GoT (try and unsee that). So why are all the boyscout fans thinking it'll be cool to have him look like jack Kirby's design?.,0
">not like a giant spiky shark man  I don't know what you're watching.   He hasn't always, he has done in comics, and it looks dog shit, and clich√©",0
ya so is superman and martian manhunter and like a million other dc characters  edit: If you arent human you are an alien,2
"They are god's that resemble earth, much like Atlantis. With the acception of krypton.  You mean to say will ferrel should be cast as darkseid and just put some colour make up on him and use his actual face?. Jesus.",0
TRANS DIMENSIONAL ...I mean thats some science shit right there LOL. Mysticism is subjective. As Im sure you are aware of the hugely popular quote: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. - Arthur C Clarke,1
gods are just powerful delusional aliens.,1
">Read some comics  Mate, how about you read some that are abit out of your 'confort zone'.",0
"I know what you were saying.. that is just one of many depictions, anyway. Personally, I think it looks shit. But, to each his own.",1
Darkseid has looked like Darkseid wellllllllll before the New52...,1
JL‚Äôs design was bland grey mess. They went half in/half out on the face and then sucked all the color out of the design. They could have easily done the humanoid look much better.   Instead we got a close relative to Teenage Mutant Ninja Doomsday,1
"Man, I just can‚Äôt relate to someone who calls THE Jack Kirby‚Äôs designs dog shit and cliche lol",1
That‚Äôs not how this works. That‚Äôs not how *any* of this works? Are you not familiar with the comics at all?,1
What kind of leaps of logic are you doing there? You‚Äôre not even trying to sound like you‚Äôre making a rational point lol,0
"‚Äú*Wingardium leviosa*‚Äù - science fiction quote, apparently.",1
You‚Äôre saying that like it‚Äôs the authority over all media when it‚Äôs clear that‚Äôs not the case by a lightyear.,1
It was more like James earl Jones from Conan the barbarian. The humanoid look would need CGI and not an actual actor. Secondly. The one above with full rendering I imagine would look far more epic than the hound from GoT with two horned hat.,1
"I don't care if Jesus did it, I can't take anyone seriously who thinks a dude with a beard in black knight armour, as a villain, doesn't looks generic and dated AF.",1
magic is just science that the writers havent explained yet,1
"I read tons of comics bro all new 52 #1s in mint. Not my fault wonder woman was brainwashed by her mother to think she was a deity when all she is, is a powerfull alien.",2
"Other than labelling every god with human features?, Which is what you're doing lol?.   I'm agruing that that is not necessary, clearly.   I provided you a rational point, where's your rational response?.",0
Fuck harry potter lol why are you bringing this up lol.,1
Im just talking about comics and comic book movies....I didnt mention any other media,1
"I don‚Äôt know, man. You‚Äôre bringing up terms like dated when one of the leads is literally just wearing colorful Greco-era war armor, and generic when talking in favor of a monster looking like the previous movie‚Äôs monster except with spiky armor and a pointy helmet and a color scheme that can be summed up as ‚Äúgray.‚Äù   Agree to disagree, then.",1
Love all that science they use with their science-y words in those sci-fi Harry Potter movies lol,1
"You said that the old gods were just aliens that humans called god, which 1. Is plain incorrect and 2. must mean you think that the old gods like Zeus (and by that logic, Wonder Woman) must be aliens too.  And then for some weird reason you think that I‚Äôd suggest that they should just cast Will Ferrel with some makeup on as Darkseid? Lmao like that‚Äôs a big part of where you lose me buddy",0
"You‚Äôre saying movies that have Gods that say they‚Äôre gods aren‚Äôt gods. That have magic that says it‚Äôs magic isn‚Äôt magic.   The DC Universe is a clashing of genres‚Äîscience fiction, fantasy, pulp adventure... Aliens exist, but so do distinctly gods and magic.",1
">Agree to disagree, then.  It's for the best man. To each his own.",0
What the fuck are you talking about harry potter for rofl,1
"But wonder woman and zeus and thor for that matter ARE aliens brah. They arent human, therefore aliens. Gods arent real bro. They just powerful aliens that call themselves gods.",0
"  >2. must mean you think that the old gods like Zeus (and by that logic, Wonder Woman) must be aliens too.  Not really seeing as they resemble worship from humans.  >1. Is plain incorrect   Not really, they come from an alien planet, with alien beings on apokolips. Though I'm sure Ava duvernay will give everyone something, with her level of imagination that would support your stance.  >And then for some weird reason you think that I‚Äôd suggest that they should just cast Will Ferrel with some makeup on as Darkseid?  Merely to suggest that the rest have humanised features. It would make sense to give the uncle of darkseid a meaning, non-earth or non human related appearance than a dude who looked like an Asgardian.",0
Nah just science or biology to explain powers.,0
"‚ÄúMagic‚Äôs just science the writers haven‚Äôt explained‚Äù  Thus, Harry Potter is just a science fiction saga that fails to explain that they‚Äôre using science and simply calls it ‚Äúmagic‚Äù for the sake of convenience. Lol",1
That‚Äôs not how this works. Gods ARE real in the DCEU. Magic is real in the DCEU. This isn‚Äôt like how Marvel did Thor in the movies.  Wonder Woman was descended from and Shazam was gifted his powers by mythological gods.,0
Jesus you just ignore everything lmao,1
I ddnt say anything about harry potter. Bro are you high,1
I didnt say anything about harry potter. Bro are you high,1
You keep saying gods but all that means is powerful alien lol,0
"The magic you are refering to is just mutants using biological powers and shit. Stuff that doesnt require tech or science, and it gets dubbed as magic. But its just their innante natural abilities due to evolution or mutation",0
"Lmao fine  ‚ÄúSHAZAM!‚Äù - science fiction quote, apparently.",1
**Literally where does it say that in these movies**,1
energy transformation using energy? edit: unknown energy*,1
"The characters refer to it as magic, but it isnt its their biological abilities. Magic isnt fucken real in the dc universe. Its just advanced science or biological alien mutaions that enable the user to manipulate energy of some form, and appears as magic. EDIT: but the writers just call it magic to diversify their characters",0
"It‚Äôs using magic bestowed by powers of gods ffs  Where do these movies even HINT at magic and gods not being real, especially when they explicitly state they are real",1
Lmao you can‚Äôt even answer it! Where does it say magic isn‚Äôt real? Where do the writers say magic isn‚Äôt real?,1
gods are just advanced delusional aliens though,1
you keep using words like magic and gods lol. You should stop,1
Where is that even HINTED to in these movies?,1
because gods dont exit you fucking nitwit so they HAVE to be advanced powerful aliens that just CALL AND REFER to themselves as god. the clsoest to god in the dc universe is spectre,1
"Why? How?   You say that it doesn‚Äôt apply to other movies so why does it apply here?  There‚Äôs literally no consistent logic to what you‚Äôre saying, nor is it based in the content we‚Äôre discussing.",1
WHat do you mean isnt based in the content were discussing? Youre the idiot that brought up harry potter when we were talking about comicbooks and movies lol.  Way to accuse me of what you did trump. EVERYTHING IM SAYING IS FOR DC COMICBOOKS AND MOVIES. FINAL. Jesus,0
Is this a harry potter sub? Nah bro this is a dc sub,0
Whoever they pick needs to be a dark-skinned black woman.   &#x200B;   Jodie Turner-Smith  Lupita   or someone else of similar make-up.,2
"Janelle Monae is fantastic. She would've been great as Catwoman, but Vixen is a mighty role too.",2
My Pick would be  Deborah Ayorinde she is a perfect for the role. Plus she is beautiful and is on the come as an actress and has gone on the record saying she would love to play a superhero role.,2
Mon√°e would be one of my top choices too.  I also think Lupita would‚Äôve been a pretty good one too. She was a fan cast of mine before she eventually went and did Black Panther,2
"Scarlett Johansson /s  But actually maybe the girl from the new Charlie‚Äôs Angels. Not sure of her name. And if she wasn‚Äôt already in Black Panther, then Lupita.",2
Honestly Jade Eshete or bust but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm biased and I talked to her about it one time.  Other than that maybe Tika Sumpter she‚Äôs so underrated but realisticly with Hollywood politics she‚Äôs to old.,2
Alexandra Daddario duh,2
Keke Palmer. She üî•üî•üî•üî•,2
Janelle is mature enough to hold it. Yyvone Orji. That young lady in Queen and Slim seems to be on the rise for new talent as well.,1
"Ooh, I like that fancast!",1
"Zazie Beetz, which would make her a double alumnus like Crystal Reed for DC on TV.",1
"Definetly Lupita Nyong'o, she's a minor character in Black Panther and in the second movie I'm sure Storm will have a lot of screentime so her not returning is viable.  Lupita deserves being the lead of her own superhero movie, not being the girlfriend of one",1
"Her being in Black Panther means nothing, she's just the lead girlfriend, she has said that for her is diffucult to find lead roles (even with her fucking Oscar) because of her skin, so if Warner Bros comes and says ""hey do you wanna be the lead on the first non-white female superhero movie?"" I'm sure she will say yes.  But the girl from Queen and Slim looks great also",1
Ella Balinska or Naomi Scott ?,0
Can't act. Can sing. Can't act.,1
"She was good in Hustlers, nothing exceptional but good",1
This happens when you have a complete vision of your work,3
"it's an interesting theme throughout the film, especially with regards to Bruce - it's fun to see when Snyder shoots him ascending or descending into the frame.   Young Bruce is lifted into the light by bats like an angel in the Beautiful Lie sequence.   But then, as adult Bruce, he descends into the Batcave in the lift. Later, when battling Superman, he descends down into the basement, literally hitting rock bottom pretty much.   But then towards the end he begins to rise again. In the warehouse scene he comes up through the floor. In the final sequence, after witnessing Superman's sacrifice, he comes up through the ground and rubble.   The only thing that messes this up is the scene in the sex traffickers house - there he escapes upwards. So maybe it doesn't work lol. But an interesting theme nonetheless, and clearly intentional in some scenes, especially the painting.",3
I loved that scene and this painting to be honest.,3
Ding ding ding ding,3
"Blows me away that some people refuse to see the thematic work Snyder and co put in MOS through BvS. I get how the theatrical version had issues with pacing and the script but the directors cut of BvS is doing so much cool shit. Weird comparison but it reminds me of Kanye in how it‚Äôs very artistic but bc of its genre or whatever people expect it to just be entertainment, and not even try to look deeper into things to understand",3
Yes! It foreshadows Darkseid.,2
No wonder it's called dawn of justice,2
"I need to watch the movie again. I loved it when it came out, kinda changed my mind after literally everyone bitched about it. But there's a lot to love about the movie",2
Perhaps foreshadowing how Ares was kicked out of Olympia?,1
"So depressing that they didn't follow that epic feel this had. This painting is so bad ass, and the music cue was amazing.",1
"How can anyone say this is a bad movie? This was such a masterpiece, work of art  Comic book movie fans don't deserve this masterpiece.",1
"I was in your boat where I thought it needed to be all literally represented but that‚Äôs not that case.  It‚Äôs a metaphorical representation of Bruce‚Äôs character. Bruce several times is referred to as having fallen, from grace. So he lives in darkness. Metaphorical, moral darkness. (On the bottom)  Then Clark dies and redeems Bruce‚Äôs character.   You were close with Bruce does literally coming out from the rubble,  but the important part is that, he literally steps *into* the light. Metaphorically showing that his character is saved. Stepping out from darkness.  It also wraps up part of Clark‚Äôs purpose as told by Jor-El.   BvS starts with the dream Bruce has, stumbling through the forest, and falling into the well. As he describes it, he has fallen.   Jor-El: *you will give the people of earth an ideal to strive towards, they will stumble, they will fall*  Bruce‚Äôs character is redeemed via Clark‚Äôs death, shown by him stepping into the light with Clark. (Now represented on the top, his grace restored, place reclaimed)  Jor-El: *in time they will join in the sun Kal, in time you will help them achieve wonders*  What‚Äôs nice is that it can be literally interpreted too in a sense from Clark‚Äôs position as now that the painting is flipped, the God‚Äôs come from the ground because well that‚Äôs where Clark is buried.",3
"I think the scene in the sex traffickers place works because its our first showing of batman and if he exits upward like the light, it could show that even though hes ""fallen"" he still attempts to do good even though he's fallen. At the end it all comes together about his redemption. Just my 2 cents though. Well written op.",1
"But even though he escaped up, it was into darkness and animalistic",1
It wasn‚Äôt his thematic work that was ever in question.  Snyder started in music videos so his visuals are unparalleled.  It‚Äôs his misunderstanding of the characters and the story that was an issue for some.,2
"People don't refuse to see his thematic work, his religious themes are more than obvious to audiences.",2
"The painting appears to be so ambiguous. That‚Äôs really cool. Before Lex turns it upside down, Bruce, having fallen represents the Devils and Clark, having literally come from the skies represents the Angels. Not sure if this is all intentional but it sure is genius.",3
God damn... BVS is a masterpiece.,2
"This directly ties into the very opening of the film and the poem narrated by Ben Affleck. I've seen some dismiss as ""sounds cool but is a load of nonsense"" but if you re-watch just that opening sequence, it essentially explains Batman's origin and set's the scene for the 2nd origin/re-birth we see in BvS.  > ""There was a time above... a time before. There were perfect things... diamond absolutes.""  Refers to his time as a young child, a time where the world made sense to Bruce. There exist's a crystallized memory of a perfect time before.  > ""But things fall, things on Earth. And what falls... is fallen.""  Refers to the night his parents died, it's the first fall of Bruce Wayne. The crushed hope, the inability to make sense of the act, unable to answer the 'why' of his parents death and the feeling of powerlessness, all haunt Bruce's dreams and nightmare. He remains broken, filled with rage, unable to make sense of the world, fallen, until ...  > ""In the dream, they took me to the light. A beautiful lie.""  He becomes Batman. The Batman persona allows him to rise (in the dream, they literally fly him out of the well). His years as Batman allow him to make renewed sense of the world, focus his energies on trying to change it for the better. But those years all come at a cost. The Batman was a 'beautiful lie'. We discover throughout the film that he's lost a Robin (the burned suit) and he's seen many good men fall (*""We've seen what promises are worth. How many good guys are left? How many stayed that way?""*). He himself is about to fall for the second time...  The film then cuts to the black zero event between Superman and Zod where we see Bruce witness first hand the tragedy and destruction that cost the lives of his employees, friends, family and countless others. He rescues a young girl who has just witnessed the loss of her parents (about the same age as he was when he lost his).  The experience brings him right back to that moment and he becomes once again consumed by fear, rage and powerlessness. He falls for the second time!  For the rest of the film, we watch a Batman in that fallen state, blinded by rage, becoming increasingly cruel, operating with 'new rules'.  At the end of the movie, we witness his second rise, the 'Martha' moment and Superman's sacrifice being the triggers.",2
yep absolutely.   I actually just remembered that the women in the basement even explicitly call him a 'demon' - so the angel/devil metaphor still applies there too  and my favorite easter egg of Bruce's fall is in the 'Must there be a superman?' montage - Wayne Financial stock is falling too haha,1
your comment just reminded me that the women in the basement even explicitly call him a 'demon' - so the angel/devil metaphor still applies there too! Thanks,1
"Dude talked about TDKR like hes read it, but he thinks Batman kills in it so he clearly hasnt. Ive no idea why this sub rides the dude so hard. Im interested in seeing his version of JL too but the dude doesnt get the characters.  Also this painting is foreshadowing the good guys fighting bad guys that come from space. It aint that deep.",0
"I‚Äôm not talking about his religious themes. Look deeper, specifically into the three main characters and how they make decisions/view the world",2
"For sure, 100%, Chris Terrio in an interview talked about how this film was heavily inspired by Early American literature, among many other things. One of my favorite uses of it comes into Superman‚Äôs character and Lex‚Äôs character. How they are literally opposites. Down to every tiny detail, their dialog, they way they are lit, color design, and score. Lex is meant to be a twisted ironic representation of Clark.   I won‚Äôt get into it because it takes a lot to write out, but the easiest example is in the score, where Lex‚Äôs score is literally Superman‚Äôs score played in reverse and distorted. This was confirmed by Junkie XL, composer of BvS.   So the painting furthers that exploration of irony, solidifying so many representations of it in the film.  It‚Äôs the final cherry on top that just really ties it all together.",2
"It doesn‚Äôt end here, there is so much alone I‚Äôm camera we irl that people don‚Äôt know about. What they did and were conveying would blow your mind. I had to a scene analysis on part of the film and it opened Up my mind to so much more!",1
"I've said my piece on the Snyderverse enough times to know you can't change the fans minds.  Superman is my favorite DC hero and Hulk my favorite Marvel.  I am super critical of both on screen.  But arguing my opinion on their current interpretations is just asking to get ripped apart on here.  So I just deal with it at this point.  For the record though, I do think symbolism and foreshadowing works best when it's not mentioned ALL THE TIME.  I do think the painting concept is cool, but when everyone is talking about it, it loses its appeal.  Or take Rey standing on that pit overlooking the ocean in TLJ, it literally looks like the Jedi Order symbol or a symbol for balance, if you use Rey and the two cliffs to form it, but if everyone caught on to that, it starts to seem like old hat.  It is what it is.",1
It really isn't deep. You would have to be more or less not watching the movie to miss these themes.,0
"You can have that opinion. Maybe you‚Äôre missing something, maybe I‚Äôm reaching, but the fact that this discussion is even happening is one way to distinguish art and entertainment",1
Most movies have themes that will lead to discussions.,1
My point is that lots of thematic work in superhero films gets overlooked. The fact that BvS was more disliked by critics than justice league illustrates that point I think,1
"It could be argued that without comparisons to Justice League or any other movie, their were flaws in Batman V Superman that outshined the thematic work. So that it wasn‚Äôt overlooked as much as overshadowed by other choices, maybe narratively, maybe something else.   I wasn‚Äôt aware that it was literally disliked by critics more than Justice League though. In my opinion that sounds like a mistake, I‚Äôd have to see the reviews to try and workout why that is though.",1
You NAILED that comic book feel dude!  Also this dialogue is a perfect middle ground between Snyder‚Äôs Superman and ‚ÄúMainstream‚Äù Superman it you get what I mean.   Still serious but uhm.. how can I put it.. a far superior version of ‚Äúis this guy still bothering you?‚Äù.,3
That 'S' looks so immaculate. You did a fantastic job. I would love to get a well-drawn comicbook or animation in this vein.,2
Who did the cringy I‚Äôm a big fan of justice line?,3
I would read a Snyder cut comic in this style of drawing this is amazing OP,3
This shit would've been bonkers.,2
"Another MoS nod could be ""You're a monster. And I'm going to stop you.""",2
"I have to apologise in advance but the ""you are my world, this is my world"" thing gets a bit repetitive in time. I guess something like ""you're hurting my people"" (punch), would work better. Just my 2 cents. I might be wrong.",0
"Thank you so much!  Yes! Glad you noticed! I wanted to pay tribute to BvS (""This is My World."") and MoS (""I'm going to have to ask you to leave.""), but also make it short and ""to the point"". This is a Superman that has found his place in the world, and acquired a sense of hope. So I wanted to infuse that classic Superman vibe. And so this is the result!  Happy you like it!",2
Thank you so much! I would love to see one as well! Hopefully done by someone much better than me :P,2
I'll give you a hint: not Terrio.,3
This line always felt cheesey.,2
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was Joss.",1
"Thank you so much! Would love to see a Snyder Cut comic as well! Hell, why not Zack's full 5-movie vision as a series? You'll probably have to get a better artist than me, tho!",1
That could've been very cool indeed!,1
"Nah, it's like the ending of Sense8 when Wolfgang says ""You don't understand, this is my city, and I bow to no one."" He's the resident guardian, you know, this is his tribe, his people. That's his world, in an abstract way, that he defends in a physical way.",1
"Again, you nailed what you wanted to deliver",2
Damned had some amazing artwork,3
"I need this pic in the highest resolution available.  As for the suit, I am not too big on it. Looks like he is wearing jeans.",3
Lee Bermejo is an absolute God.,2
"To be honest, I thought that was the Knightmare suit for a few minutes.",1
"I kinda hope that they redesign the Noel a bit suit if that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre taking inspiration from. Not a huge fan of how the bat symbol connects to the cape at the shoulders, or those jagged pads on his abs",1
I love this suit. Especially the symbol and how its somewhat hidden. That‚Äôs the one part of the suit that could disappear and I wouldn‚Äôt care.,1
The Bermejo suit would work grey if they made the symbol separate from the cowl.,1
I'd love Art Deco Gotham... and a kind of film that would look great in a B&W bluray cut.,1
Well I love his suit and the aesthetic I don‚Äôt think it would work well in live action,0
kinda looks like he's wearing a diaper :/,0
THE sEX üòçüòç,0
they're not quite jeans. his whole costume is militaristic and the pants are more like fatigues,3
"I honestly think a vigilante Batman would not be wearing body molded rubber armor, and loose-ish fabric would suit him much better. The suit looks really good [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/vbW7we7XCHtAMJ8V6)  [here ](https://images.app.goo.gl/ZnfvAxvbipZLLsf4A) and [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/MqJ1cz6tY6kxak23A)",2
super nice guy too,1
"I like the jagged ab pads, but I agree that the bat symbol connected to his cowl would have to go.",1
Of course. That's half the reason these films get made.,3
Yes. Joker was an exception as it wasn‚Äôt marketed like other comic book films. So it didn‚Äôt have all the tie in products.,2
"I think Bill could be a great Joker, but I doubt he‚Äôd tie himself to another clown.   As for Wallstr√∂m, I don‚Äôt see it. He‚Äôs a good actor, but I don‚Äôt see him as Joker.",3
"While I think he‚Äôd do a good job, Skarsg√•rd as Joker is right up there with Cranston as Luthor for laziest fancast of all time.",3
"I think if asked, Bill may do it. I think he would do a pretty good job even it is an obvious choice. He plays creepy roles well. His brothers may also be a good pick too.",1
Every week there's this _exact_ post. Not very inspired casting.,1
I feel like Reeves Joker will be some real outside of the box casting. Skarsgard is very uninspired and i feel like his Joker will be totally unique from previous iterations.,1
"Well Phoenix isn‚Äôt the DCEU Joker and Leto is out, so yes they will need to recast Joker.",1
I'd like to see Joker play older than that. A 20 year old Joker just doesn't land for me.,1
They're not going to jump from a prestige actor like Joaquin Phoenix to Skarsgard or Wallstorm. Whoever the next Joker is will probably be an Academy Award Nominee or Winner.,0
Bill is 4 years younger than Pattinson.  Wallstr√∂m is 3 years older than Pattinson.   Neither is 20.,2
"Joaquin started in a character study solo movie, they needed a great actor. They don't need a 100x Oscar winner with 1000 awards or whatever for a role in a Batman movie.",2
And that's based on....?,1
So Eddie Redmayne? Sure.,1
What does their relative age to Pattinson have to do with anything? It doesn't. I'm just saying I would prefer a much older Joker.,0
Every single actor that has played Joker in the movies has been an Academy Award Nominee or Winner.,1
"Eddie Redmayne, Daniel Kaluuya, Andrew Garfield, and Dev Patel but we aren‚Äôt ready for that conversation",1
"Pattinson is Batman. If they were to recast Joker for a DCEU project, it‚Äôd probably be to match him.   Also, you didn‚Äôt say that you‚Äôd prefer an ‚Äúolder Joker‚Äù. You said you didn‚Äôt want a 20 year old playing him.   Neither suggested actor is close to 20 years old, though.",2
Cesar Romero wasn't.,1
I know that neither of them is exactly 20 years old. And preferring an older Joker is literally the *first* thing I said. Like the very first sentence.  Go be a jackass somewhere else.,0
I'm talking from Jack Nicholson onwards.    The 60s movie was cute but it hardly counts as it's a spinoft of the series.,1
"Bill is 29. Martin is 36. That‚Äôs a pretty significant difference.   I‚Äôm not being obtuse. I‚Äôm pointing out the ridiculousness of using ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a 20 year old‚Äù to argue against either actor, when neither actor is even close to being 20 years old.  Edit: >And preferring an older Joker is literally the first thing I said  It‚Äôs not. The first thing you said was that you wanted a Joker ‚Äúolder than that‚Äù. Given your provided context, that means older than 20.  And both actors are significantly older than 20.",2
Moving the goalposts doesn't magically make you right.,0
There's no way that you're honestly so fucking stupid that you don't know what hyperbole is. I'm not falling for your weak ass trolling.,0
"I'm not moving the goalpost.    Obviously a spinoff of a 60s campy show was not gonna go for big level talent; they were using the same actors from the show.    But when it's a blockbuster movie such as Batman 1989, The Dark Knight, etc they go after higher caliber talent. And for Joker they've always gone for Academy Award Nominees or Winners when they're making blockbusters.",1
I‚Äôm not trolling. I‚Äôm just pointing out your weak ass arguments.,2
">every Joker in the movies is an academy award nominee or winner, if you only count the ones who have been nominated for or won an academy award  Okay, buddy. Whatever you say.",0
He seems to just be going round picking arguments with people and downvoting them.,1
Goddamn it you're frustrating.,1
"Yes, you are.",0
"Sure dude, they're just gonna give a role to a lame uninspired choice like Bill Skarsgard because he played a clown before, never mind they could get much better actors for the part because of the prestige the character now has with Nicholson, Ledger and now Phoenix giving iconic performances.",1
I never said they were going to give the role to Skarsgard.,1
"I doubt WB is going to pivot back to the stage in the DCEU that saw the most rejection, especially now when they're doing much better with a series of hits that only reference previous films.",2
Step 3: go back in time to ensure BvS was well-liked and didn't collapse at the box office.,3
"I wouldnt bet on seeing it until at least about the 10th anniversary of the movie's release, if ever. WB has spent the last couple of years doing everything they can to distance themselves from Snyder's vision and rebuild fresh, and they are finally having some success at the box office and with fans and critics and have a new Batman on the way. The very last thing on earth they are going to do is remind audiences of the Snyder era, and I think people just have to accept that. Theres zero chance of it appearing before Matt Reeve's Batman is well and truly established, and before they do whatever to fix Superman.",0
"I agree, they have a new approach that's fine however what they did to Zack is definitely wrong and unethical. To listen to the fans, and respect the filmmaker, releasing the cut is great pr and respects fans and Zack. Wb after all is known as a filmmaker driven studio.",3
Sometimes the best way to move forward is to reflect on the past.,1
"Barry, you know what to do.",2
You collapsed with this comment.,0
The SC doesn't hurt any of that though. It's not like they're getting rid of all t hy e WIP movies and saying they're just going back to Snyder. It's just releasing something they already have done so that people will finally have closure. There is absolutely no downside to releasing the SC.,1
Movies in production can be cancelled or delayed. Just saying.,0
"They'll need to callback to this movie someday if they have the lesser intentions to do another Justice League feature someday. It's a high profile brand and it's damaged now. If they just pretend that it never existed, it will only feed this past ghost for years and years.",1
"I mean, he's technically not wrong though, had BvS not tanked on its second OW, becoming the only film to open at 150M+ and not make a billion world wide, WB probably wouldn't have drastically changed JL at the last minute",3
"That would imply he is wrong, which he isn't",2
I always assumed he said Wayne Mannors out of the window with Mannors/manners having a double meaning  I didn't know the word wane,3
"When Lex first sees Clark and Bruce at the party, he's very excited they are meeting.  To me it seemed he was hinting with his comments to them.",3
Source  https://twitter.com/moviedetail/status/1198516892828422144?s=20,3
"No matter how many more times I watch it, there is always more to garner and take away.",3
"Dude, I‚Äôve seen this movie like 20 times and never caught that. I love this movie even tho it got so much hate for the Martha line.",3
This is a great line but I always had an issue with Lex knowing Batman's identify without any explanation.,3
"I knew he knew who both he and clark were after the first viewing of the Ultimate cut, and I always look to his slapping Clark at the party and telling Bruce not to pick a fight with this guy.  Which was him warning him not to pick a fight with Superman.",3
So maybe an unpopular opinion but I actually liked Eisenburg's Luthor,3
This movie will always be my favorite Superhero movie.,3
Lex portrayal is a fairly accurate depiction of the smartest man in the world.,3
So did he know at the party when introducing them?,2
PUNDEMONIUM,2
"That is pretty great. Not a fan of the movie, but that is pretty great.",2
"My favorite was when he recruited Wally for his scheme. First at his house and then when Wally is reading his statement in front of Congress, it's nothing but cripple puns lol",2
"i need you guys to be 100% genuine with me.  is the UC worth a watch? the theatrical cut is one of my least favourite movies of all time and it made me dislike the characters for quite some time. it had the same effect on me that The Amazing Spider-man 2 gave me after watching it.   now, i‚Äôve heard the UC is much better, but i mean, is it true?",3
BvS itself was next level.,3
How the hell did he figure out Bruce is Batman?,2
"His snort after that line is my second favorite lex moment of the movie behind ""rrrraah"" after the ""I would not let them tell me"" on the helipad.",2
"Wayne had no manners. Wayne, manners, Wayne Manor. Home of Bruce Wayne, better known as Batman. Mentor to Dick Grayson, his orphan ward who, at night, would don the colorful vestments of The Boy Wonder, A.K.A. Robin!",2
"I find it funny how those who claim to have watched the movie say ""this isn't like Lex Luthor,"" or ""that's not accurate to the comics.""  And what I say is that there is no concrete rule or version for any of these characters.  That's what makes them mythology and not celebrities, DC heroes especially.  They should be what we need them to be in the modern world.    Once you apply some ""rule"" to a character they just stagnate into a pool of circular repetition.  Nothing is advanced, the characters don't evolve.  You have to deconstruct them and find out what drives them and why they are what they are.    This Lex is exactly what that character is today: a spoiled millennial rich kid, too smart, too knowledgeable to accept a Godlike alien in the sky as the most powerful man in the world.  According to him, that position is deservedly his.    And somehow, this is ""not correct"" or ""boring"" or ""not accurate to the comics?""    You're living in a fucking dream world.",2
Chris Terrio is a freaking genius.,3
The dialogue in this movie is amazing. I also like when Lex's dialogue when talking to Superman atop the LexCorp tower,2
"I really fucking hate that we‚Äôll never get this group on screen again, I loved BvS and Jesse played a great Luthor.",2
"This movie had everything to be greater, the extended edition was awesome to me, however that Martha Line makes no sense in a world where Batman kills. If they fixed that it would be probably my favorite DC Movie.",2
Whoa! I never caught that!,1
I can't believe I didn't notice this!,1
"Holy Shit, I never noticed that",1
I thought it was just a writers' pun just put in as sly wordplay. Nothing to do with Lex knowing anything.,1
I mean ngl this is pretty obvious cos Jesse stresses those words but whatever,1
"My subtitle just straight up said ""Civilization on the Wayne Manor's out the window""",1
"I loved this version of BvS. Sometimes, I wonder if we'll ever see that JL Snyder Cut of it.",1
"Ever since seeing the UC I wasn't even aware it was a pun, to me Lex was just saying Wayne Manor isn't civilized anymore, yet people tore me apart once because it's a pun or somehow missed that.",1
"Yeah. He also made a comment about partnering up with Bruce for something, and his ""R&D is up to all sorts of no good"" in his Friends of the Library party.  Which they kind of did... Lex supplied Bruce with the Kryptonite and information, and Bruce did the tinkering himself.",1
Pretty obvious the first time,1
"Great dialogue, just think it would have been more suited for a different actor delivering them.",2
Everyone caught this the second lines from the ultimate edition leaked online.   But I guess not ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù,1
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in an unfamiliar city and starving for Indian food. Are There Curry vendors nearby?‚Äù  ‚ÄúAl is your best friend. But what happens when you have to Bury Al In the dirt?‚Äù  Omg he knows them all.,1
"Man i'm really going to miss Jesse's Lex Jr. :(  It was such an interesting take for a character that we have not seen in the big screen, i really liked him despise a lot of him being the typical unexplained ""He just knows it and times it all because reasons and plot convenience, just deal with it and buy it"" bs from the generic genius/powerless bad guy trope like the one in Civil War and such  BvS man, if they hadn't mashed up like 5 movies worth of material all in one long ass convoluted movie it could have been so much more. The concepts were simply amazing.  Now we'll never see the bold Eisenberg",1
What the does this post mean?  Batman knows Lex knew his true identity even from the beginning...   You guys think this pun was said by Luthor with the intention of telling him ‚ÄúI know you are Bruce Wayne‚Äù ?  Luthor‚Äôs plan wouldn‚Äôt have worked if he didn‚Äôt know who they both were. He sent Bruce those letters cause he knew he was Batman...,1

i hate how he knew their id in that movie. thats like a final movie thing. i do need read comics but in the cartoons batman has been really good at hiding who he is.,1
"My favorite Lex pun is ""Mother of God, would you look at the time!"" After the talk with Clark about his mom lmao",1
"OH, what good writing! Marthastic!",0
"I've always watched it without the subtitles and i always thought Lex said ""Civilization of the Wayne manners out the window""",1
How did I not notice this before lol,1
"Since there will never be any sort of payoff for this, I'm now picturing that Joffrey meme from GoT that says ""not really relevant then is it?""",1
Movie details,1
Damn so he was like a Lex Riddler,1
Good lord are you kidding me with this shit?,1
"I don't get the ""caves in"" bit? Is he trying to say that's a reference to the batcave? .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Cos that's pretty dumb",0
"Damn, all you folks just having the big ‚ÄúA ha!!‚Äù moment now?   Shit was kinda obvious on first viewing, since Lex was engaging in that sort of wordplay throughout the film.  To quote another wordsmith, NYPD Detective John McClane, ‚ÄúWELCOME TO THE PARTY, PAL!!!!‚Äù",0
I don't think it was intended but cool catch,0
"Yes, that was obvious on the first watch id say.",0
"He literally used guns outside of that 2 minute car chase you speak of. Pretty much ruined what could‚Äôve been a perfect portrayal of Batman.  Clearly you cared just enough to reply, just like I cared enough to call it how it is. You dawn of justice/justice league defenders are a delusional bunch.haha",0
I cant stand this movie at all but that is frikking amazing.,0
"Wane also means ""to decline"" so the pun works on multiple levels",3
"Wane like a waning moon (""decreasing"")",3
"I always assumed he thought Bill Gates was Batman. ""Out the window."" Windows 10.",3
"I think that's not horribly uncommon, but it might be fun for you to learn about the phases of the moon.",1
"Lex is the kind of dude that when he makes a joke that flies over everyone, considers it proof that he's smart.  &#x200B;  In that party, dude was basically saying ""I know what's going to go down and y'all have no idea""",3
"""Wow, that's a strong grip! You *definitely* don't want to get in a fight with this person.""",3
Wasn‚Äôt that like a ‚Äúwell duh‚Äù situation? Why else would he give a crap that Bruce Wayne is meeting someone?,3
Of course he‚Äôs excited. He invited both of them.,3
So Lex is the only one with good enough eye sight to see the batman's mouth sure looks alot like Bruce Wayne's while Superman looks exactly like Clark Kent without glasses?,3
Well yeah that‚Äôs obvious. Lex is playing everyone before the movie even starts. He knows who everyone is.,1
Thanks. Any news on whether the Snyder version will be released?,1
Garner? I see what you did there,3
You only caught this now?,0
That‚Äôs not why lol,0
"Is it really that odd that Mark Zuckerburg would know everything? üòÖ  &#x200B;  Jokes aside, It's not uncommon in various materials for Lex ""I have a level 12 intellect"" Luthor to know secret identities  [https://comicnewbies.com/2013/08/14/how-lex-luthor-joined-the-justice-league/](https://comicnewbies.com/2013/08/14/how-lex-luthor-joined-the-justice-league/)",3
"Lex managed to find out about Clark, Diana, Barry, Cyborg and Aquaman so I always assumed it's logical that he found out Batman's identity the same way.",3
"Eh, with his resources, I think it's an easy thing to believe. DNA left at crime scenes, picking up activity around Wayne Manor, realizing what means Batman would need to have and narrowing down from there, etc.",3
That doesn‚Äôt only add to his character for you? We know Lex is a genius level intellect and this last line kind of affirms that he was scripting out the entire Batman Superman fight. Lex knowing Batman‚Äôs identity at the end provides that he probably knew it the entire time leading to the server hack etc.,1
"The biggest problem I have is that Batman, the world's greatest detective, gets fooled so easily throughout the movie and doesn't find out Clark's true identity.",2
"Batman's identity is probably one of the easiest to guess in universe. If he existed in our world, the internet would figure it out within a couple days.",1
I figure his suspicions began with Bruce Wayne snooping around at his event. Not long after the Batman started getting involved in his businesses. It's a stretch but Bruce Wayne and Diana stole those files which contain highly confidential material which was then being used to sabotage his businesses,1
"Why's that? He has as many, if not more, resources than Bruce does and Bruce figured out who Clark was without any explanation. And Lex is obviously evil.",1
There was a mini BvS comic line that served as a prequel to the film. I vaguely remember it showing Lex using drones to follow Batman and Superman around to help him identify who they were,1
"Finding out Batman's identity in the era of satellite monitoring is easy, you just watch him and pick up the patterns of behavior. Same for Superman or literally anybody else that is not Martian Manhunter or The Flash.",1
>This is a great line but I always had an issue with Lex knowing Batman's identify without any explanation.  It seems everybody knows Batman's identity in this universe. And for some weird reason it's not a big deal!,1
"I don't like the idea that he knows, but this is basically Superman: Birthright Lex, which is the smartest man alive and only makes plans to force Superman to interact with him because he views both of them at that level of being.",1
Darkseid told him *shrug*,1
I think what people failed to understand about his version of Lex is that he had not become *the* Lex Luthor yet. His character had to go through the change we saw. The Lex we saw in BvS was not the same one in Justice League.,3
"The Ultimate Edition, that is.",3
"Completley, BvS ULTIMATE is pretty cool.",2
"""My wife... *walked*... out on me""",1
"it's so great. I've seen people criticise that scene - but it's literally Lex mocking this man, his words coming out of his mouth, just a total puppet. He even turns in the wheelchair in the same way. So great.",2
I was the same as you. I absolutely hated this movie after seeing the theatrical cut but the Ultimate edition is very good.   I would say whether or not the UC is worth watching depends on why you didn‚Äôt like it in the first place.   If like me you didn‚Äôt enjoy the theatrical cut because it made no sense and the story was poor the ultimate cut fills in all the gaps and makes for a great story imo. The characters are no longer shallow and non sensical but have deep motivations for why they‚Äôre all doing the things they do.   If you didn‚Äôt like the tone or the style of the movie then the ultimate cut does nothing for that and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth watching if that‚Äôs the case.,3
"The UC is great. It adds in so many scenes that develop the characters and world and makes the plot whole.  The TC rearranged many scenes and sequences that the UC corrects  If you‚Äôre still not convinced, I recommend this:   https://youtu.be/IslGylvkjPE",3
Whenever I talk about BvS I only think of the UE cut. It‚Äôs the way the film should‚Äôve been released in theaters. Another stupid decision by WB.,2
The Director's Cut of all of Snyder's films is always vastly superior. BvS is no different. It fills in some gaps and the pacing is much better.,1
"The UC is certainly better than the TC. Whether it‚Äôs actually good or not is certainly up to interpretation. (It‚Äôs probably not, but it‚Äôs at least not filled with plot holes like the TC).",1
"No. These people are exaggerating how much the UC changes, it just makes certain plot points more clear, but it‚Äôs still essentially the same movie. I don‚Äôt really understand how anyone can hate the theatrical cut but then completely love the UC.",1
"Gotta disagree with the herd here. There is a reason those cuts were made. More screen times for these fan boy's favorite characters might please them, but did not make for a better movie in any way. The UC's pacing is off, an IMHO is only worth watching if you enjoyed the original and want more. If you didn't enjoy what you got in the original the extra content in the UC is not going to help.",0
"Like I feel of some things were changed, it would‚Äôve been just as influential as the Dark Knight, and I think it still was very influential.",0
"do you know how a worker (idk his rank) in Wayne Enterprise knew Bruce Wayne is Batman in Nolan's The Dark Knight?  So with how Luthor is so powerful and influential in his world, pretty much he might know that fact like a piece of cake.",1
Knowledge is Power,1
God among men,3
Mother of God! Would you look at the time.,2
That Martha Line works if the Batman in question has been pretending it‚Äôs all fine and the line makes him realize he‚Äôs become the monster he‚Äôs supposed to be stopping. Which is the case here,3
"Clearly the guy had a moment of clarity in his hazed PTSD rage. What better way to end the beef by a mother, who isn't even present anymore, and bringing him to his senses.",2
The only time he's killed was during the chase scene,0
"What gets me is that you can clearly tell he knows who both of them are when they meet at the party, but people point to THIS moment in surprise that he knows who they are.   I mean, he basically invited batman to come steal his files and kryptonite in order to facilitate the fight. Do people not understand that 100% of that movie (up till the big fight) was Lex Luthor setting up the fight everyone came to the theater to see? How is ANYONE that's ever seen it surprised that Lex knows who they both are?",2
"I disagree mate. Who better than Mark Zuckerburg himself to play Birthright Lex, the egotistical and hip CEO with a God complex?",3
ok.,1
"I know right?! The upvotes feel undeserved. And same for other posts about details in BvS that ""everyone"" got. Should I start posting details now?   Maybe I'm jealous. Sue me",1
The point is batman doesn't know he (lex) knows who is...,2
"I believe The point is that this is Lex taunting Bruce with ""yeah, I know who you really are. I orchestrated all this. Don't think it's all happily ever after now""",1
Different continuities should not be expected to follow others,1
I duhn want et,1
No. It's not dumb. It's on point. He's saying in a coy way he knows the connection between Bruce Wayne and Batman while still being poetic about it,2
Lex is a lexophile,1
I said i didn't because i looked it up now :P,3
Half Life 3 confirmed,1
Phases of the moon?  Edit: Nevermind u just googled it,1
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Lex Luthor jokes",3
Would you say he was 10 steps ahead and Clark/Bruce didn't even know what game they were playing?,1
"""Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.""",1
"E: Bloomin' 'ell, I thought we didn't like the movie, can't say anything right today",0
"The whole reason Lex invites them both is to pit them against each other. He invited Clark specifically, Perry calls Clark a nerd for getting the invite.  Mercy even catches Bruce in the act trying to steal information of Lex's servers which is also pretty self-explanatory.  Lex's plan had him taunting Bruce the whole film.  So yep, very much a ""well duh"" situation.",2
"I think it‚Äôs fair to assume that no one gets a good look at Batman‚Äôs mouth hole except us, the audience. And maybe Gordon, who traditionally doesn‚Äôt care much to figure out his identity. He operates at night, moves extremely fast, and probably leaves most of his enemies with concussions. It‚Äôs no surprise they don‚Äôt remember much about him.  As for Superman, there are some comic panels that try and explain it. The most plausible ones say that Clark is essentially the world‚Äôs best actor, as he can control his muscles precisely enough to completely change the way he moves and speaks. His glasses also make his eyes seem grey instead of blue. And there‚Äôs the fact that Superman doesn‚Äôt wear a mask, so people aren‚Äôt really looking for a secret identity. They probably just assume that Superman IS his identity and that he lives somewhere remote and doesn‚Äôt have to eat or interact with others unless he wants to, which isn‚Äôt too far from the truth sometimes.",2
"This is the Snyder version. It's the Ultimate Cut of BvS, which represents Snyder's vision of what he wanted the movie to be.   The ""Snyder Cut"" that everyone is talking about is for Justice League.",3
"In his defence, I only caught it for the first time as well",3
Honestly...Yes.,3
It's.... 75% why. Seems to be the only thing many people come up with,3
"""I don't know who this is"" -Lex Luthor after looking at Flash's face.",3
what's the series this is from?,2
"The problem with him knowing, unless there is an actual explanation where he figures it out because of information only he gets, is it forces you to ask ""why doesnt anyone else just know""",1
He also gave most of them their branding. It's a big flaw in the movie for me.,3
"Honestly, I think figuring out batmans identity would be fairly straightforward.  About the time some dude comes at you in a tank-car that connects via blue tooth to his super suit you can pretty much cross off like 90% of any given city, but Gotham in particular has a host of rich like New York City.  There are 112 billionaires in NYC, we can assume this is the level of wealth needed when factoring in not just tech costs, but R&D upgrades and repair costs to anything on that level.  So now you have a pool of less than 150 people. You then rule out those with criminal ties, which for gotham we will say that narrows the pool by about 30% (generous for Gotham honestly).   So lets say that leaves you with 60-80 people.  Of those, who has a large *personal* investment in Gotham.  That narrows it down further.   From there its just surveillance. Who‚Äôs walking funny after a report of batman getting into a lot of activity over the week. Who‚Äôs missing a lot of meetings? Who‚Äôs missing the few times batman is seen outside of gotham?   It might take a bit, but honestly it‚Äôs just a waiting game at that point.",3
I'm willing to believe that he is incredibly good at hiding those things and others. to a point that would be impossible in real life. But I also think that Lex Luthor is also supernaturally smart in a way that he could find out who Batman was.,1
"Sure, you could make lots of arguments around that, but it was poorly executed and made for a worse story overall.",0
"To be completely honest, Bruce at no point in the film views Clark as a person. He's an enemy, an alien, a threat - it doesn't even seem to cross his mind that he might live a normal life and I mean why would he? He's a god, he can lift buildings, and take a bullet straight to the face, why would this God, who Bruce believes to be a threat to the survival of the human race, why would he be a normal person with a normal life?  I think the key thing to keep in mind is Bruce takes any excuse he can the whole film to demonise Superman and justify his actions.  ""You were never a God, you were never even a man"" - This line is exactly what I'm talking about. He doesn't care who or what Superman is, he just wants to bring him down, whatever the cost.  He's angry, grief struck and suffering PTSD the whole film, nightmares over and over of his parents death or the hell Superman is about to bring, it's actually kind of believeable that Bruce, as broken as he was, wouldn't care *who* Superman is, he just wants to teach him that he's not a God and that he doesn't matter - finding out that Superman is just a regular dude in his day-to-day would probably break that tunnel-vision for him and break his disillusionment that he is a threat to humanity.  And then the first thing that happens during the ""Martha"" scene is Bruce's PTSD coming back, fucking with his head and causing him to break down and start questioning everything - only when Lois Lane comes in and clarifies that Superman was just there to save his mother he realises he was the villain.  Anyway, tl;dr he straight up didn't seem to care *who* Superman was, just that he needed to be stopped, and the film seems to back this up a lot",2
"Bruce doesn't get fooled, he just doesn't follow the correct tracks. A detective is only as good as the evidence they have  Lois was able to find out about Clark by following his trail of jobs. She had an actual trail of evidence that took her to the source. Bruce, on the other hand, is using mostly public security footage to see public appearances of Superman. As great as that is, it doesn't give him as much to work with unless Superman accidentally flies somewhere that reveals he's Clark. If Bruce has a bit more evidence, he'd have figured it out",2
I think this happened because this version of Bruce was worn out mentally. The guy has been fighting crime for 20 years and he lost his Robin. Then with what happened in Metropolis when Zod and Superman faught just put him down that path. The destruction those two caused posed a much greater threat than any Gotham villian ever.,2
"He does though, so how doesn't he??.",1
"To be fair, this Batman was emotionally pretty broken. I see his rage and fear towards the events of MoS, blinding him.",1
True. Most of the people did not get that at all...,3
"Same applies to Superman through MOS, BVS and JL. People thought he was too dark he wasnt Superman. Thats the point, he grows into the Superman we love over the 3. MOS, hes young, inxperienced and unsure of what hes supposed to do and be, BVS, he has more experience, he has learned the concequences of killing Zod and is trying to help Earth, he feels responsible for peoples deaths, like in the courthouse, and isnt sure if he wants to be looked up to like he is, JL, hes come back and traded his old suit for a brighter color beause thats what people need, a beacon of hope and hes finally accepted that thats what he is, he jokes with Cyborg about being alive because theyve both died or been close to it, he understands Batman is the man with a plan and is fully willing to take his orders, immediately referring to him when he arrives ""How can I help?"", he smiles when the job is done because now he knows what hes meant to do and who he is now, hes Superman, the Superman everyone wanted out of the gate, but also the Superman we had to watch grow into that for the first time ever. Lets not forget, this isnt done with Joss reshoots in JL either, Snyder shot Clark choosing the brighter duds and meeting Alfred with a huge ol grin on his face, this was his plan. Hes Superman, he just had to grow into it a bit.",1
The butt cave is worth the price of admission,2
"The theatrical cut isn't horrible either. The Ultimate Edition is a finished product, so it's obviously superior, but the theatrical cut was still amazing.",2
"Yes, the one op mentions on his post.",1
Wow you get depressed so easily by something that pleases others. You should life check yourself,3
Did you get depressed by this? LMAO new generation gets depressed by everything wow.,1

I can't even piss *standing up*,2
nice.,1
"I like that Wally tries to do the 180¬∞ spin thing that Lex did, implying that he's getting influenced, but he's not quite there yet because he still needed to adjust a little.",1
I agree with you dude. I know the UE took out a lot of content that would clear things up but honestly the theatrical cut doesn't do too bad either. People are exaggerating.,1
I liked the TC,1
The UC does make a lot of changes:  https://youtu.be/IslGylvkjPE  The main criticism is that the stuff that was cut was actually important to the plot and the development of the characters. The end result is the film is much less confusing and much more complete,1

"It absolutely does make it a better movie. Sorry. You‚Äôre just objectively wrong here. You can like the movie or not, the UC is a better movie. To say otherwise just proves you weren‚Äôt really paying much attention.",1
Influential in that it made general audiences dislike 2 of the most popular fictional characters of all time? Influential in that it made WB afraid to make more movies with those characters? I would like to hear any argument for why BvS was at all positively influential.,0
"Because Reese dug up old plans for the Tumbler which led him to figure it out. Luthor just knowing is lazy writing, which is a the biggest problem with BvS.",0
"That would work if he didn't kill all of those guys after that when rescuing Martha, you know throwing grenades and all that.",1
The people in the warehouse fight are hella dead.,2
"Lex changes over time. Hackman was nothing like comic Lex at the time. Rosenbaum was quite psychotic. Why are people only complaining now?     Oh right the movie has ""Zack Snyder"" written on it which automatically means it ruined their childhoods or whatever BS they say now.",3
"Sigh, it's been pretty much universally accepted he wasn't a good fit for Lex. Even if it wasn't, I personally didn't think he worked.",0
"After all that shit ended in the movie, Batman still doesn‚Äôt know he was manipulated?",2
I mean I get the Wayne Manor thing as him being very smart but the cave thing is pretty dumb. So he's seen the batcave? And Bruce is supposed to relate Lex using the word cave with Batcave? Tbf I think it's a stretch . . It's also nice that this Lex is an idiot when it comes to scheming but he's a poetry nerd,0
Oh ok. üëç. Have a great day.,3
To be faaaaair,3
first thing I thought of too lmao,2
I bet Lex loves Rick and Morty.,1
"So, did you miss the whole part where Batman gasses and then beats the absolute dogshit out of Superman before nearly harpooning him through the face?",2
"Yes, I'm asking about the Cider cut for Justice League. Any update on that?",1
I‚Äôm genuinely surprised cuz this was all over the place when the film came out.,3
Wow. I feel like everyone was talking about this when the movie came out,2
"Man, years later this sub is still in denial.  I mean, also like the ultimate cut. But martha is not 75% of the criticism",1
It‚Äôs just a bad movie with one good scene,0
"To be fair, DCAU Wally is just a civilian. He isn't exactly super famous and besides his powers there's nothing about him that can make him stand out to someone like Lex.",2
It's from Injustice: Gods Among Us (and it's actually stated at the bottom of that picture). It's a great series!,2
The average person isn't a level 12 intellect billionare with tons of surveillence resources,1
"I don't think it's that big of a deal. In the case of Wonder Woman and Aquaman the logos already exist, WW has already worn an outfit with the logo and Aquaman's A is the symbol for Atlantis. Flash's logo is so simple. It's not that hard to think Lex would use lightning for a super speed metahuman. Cyborg's is the hardest tp justify, but again I don't it's that crazy that Lex would use a c for Cyborg, which Vic literally is by definition of the word not just his super hero name.   EDIT: Others have pointed out that Flash was also active so his Logo existed already as well",3
"Honestly, I feel like those JL teases were kind of out of place and interrupted the flow. I think a better way to do it would be to show the logos and all that, but as a mid-credit sequence.",2
"I think if this particular ""branding"" element with the video files had further movies to explore with him as a character, it could lead to some Project Cadmus bullshit he was planning to stir up, either coercing or brainwashing the League members to become a batallion doing his bidding or as part of a government contract, and the logos were a way to market them to the world as acceptable in a ""The Boys"" kind of way  Just my 2 cents for where this could've gone",1
Keep in mind Bruce also been Batman for over 20 years. That's plenty of time to also leave tracks that Lex 's surveilance could pick up on,3
"Still leaves open the possibility of multiple people (who don't necessarily all have to be billionaires) funding a single vigilante, who doesn't necessarily have to be rich, and also you can't rule out those with criminal ties.",1
"If we go by comics, Lex Luthor and Bruce Wayne are the top two smartest people on Earth (though it's not clear which is smarter). So it totally makes sense for Bruce to be invisible to the overwhelming majority of people but not to Lex. (#3 is Mr. Terrific in case you're curious.)  But hey, Tim Drake was able to deduce Bruce's identity, so, like you, I don't think Lex figuring out Batman's identity is terrible far-fetched.",2
"They didn't execute the explanation. It was part of the assumptions. They didn't *need* to explain it, because it's not a hard thing to reckon with.",1

"True, still a big jump in quality",1
"But there are more than just DC and Marvel, i mean Green Hornet was really good, but no one talks about that.  i would say watchmen might be mine, cos it's the most accurate in that it pretty much leap off the pages, instead of just barely following the base line. Not saying anything against TDK trilogy but I would have loved to actually see Year one and the long Halloween live action.",1
"Yes! That always felt so intentional to me, I'm glad someone else feels the same. It's just off, and awkward. This film man, this film...",1
Cool. My point was about people who claim to hate the TC but somehow love the UC tho.,1
"The assumption is that making things less confusing makes them less bad. It isn't true. This was a flawed movie from the inception. Snyder doesn't respect the source material, or he wouldn't have tried to cram so much into one movie.  Good for you that you like it. It's ok to like something most people think is bad. That doesn't make it good.",0
mmkay,0
"I'm with you.  It's baffling how many people on here love BvS. I, legitimately, can't think about that movie without getting angry. It's just so freaking stupid.  Batman is about to kill Superman, a person who he knows is ridiculously powerful and believes is evil and stops because he cares for his mother?? My god. Some of the worse people in history still cared for their mothers, that's not a valid reason to think Superman is suddenly good.",0
"This is nonsense, he didn't kill people or threw a grenade, he defended himself against trained assassin's, scum that kill for money, not your average street thief with a chance for redemption, these guys where killers and he fought them as needed, and made the grenade bounce back to them in a fight to the death. He did what was right in that situation, and that's besides him being at his lowest which yes it's fkcng up trained killers (well deserved) to save an innocent woman.",2
"It's still an improvement. Remember, The Martha Line is the first part in Bruce setting out to redeem himself. Note how during the Warehouse fight, he's far less brutal and direct than he was earlier in the film. His only kills now are much more instinctual (like kicking the guy to stop the grenade) rather than needlessly reckless for the sake of efficiency.",1
That guy who got hit in the head with a fucking crate. His skull must've imploded. Also the dude with the grenade (even if he actually did that to himself).,2
"And that time, I meant to say the only time he's killed is during the span of BVS",1
"But this is Snyder's point. The shooting one thing but through fighting, Batman would've killed many people, or disabled them permanently.",1
Most people just want boring bald man in a suit that hates Superman. ‚ÄúWaaah Lex Luthor has a personality and doesn‚Äôt act exactly how I imagined he would!‚Äù  I will defend this movie until I‚Äôm dead,2
"Because Hackman played in the 80s before DCAU Luthor, and everyone who didn't like smallville stopped watching in 2001.",2
Yea we'd much rather Lex and Superman be at odds over real estate!,2
"The reason people say that is because Birthright Lex isn't as well known.

If even all you knew was that there was a superhero named Batman who called his tools with a Bat Prefix, would it be that unreasonable to assume his hideout may be a cave of some sort?",2
Tbh it is a stretch but it fits a narrative so it's a Canon theory now,1
To be faaaair,3
Did you recognize the thing? I recognized that thing! I clapped when I recognized the thing!,2
Yes my sources tell me no because we're on reddit and not running major Hollywood studios,1
All over the place? Where? Pretty much every person was too busy bashing BvS when it came out to actually look for details like this.,3
People miss all kinds of stuff. What's obvious to someone may not be to others  &#x200B;  I made a post about that on r/tumblr  [https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/e16e0h/did\_you\_know\_that\_in\_skyrim/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/e16e0h/did_you_know_that_in_skyrim/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x),3
This was only in the UE so only people interested in the Blu-ray caught it I think,2
Unfortunately I never had such level conversations about the details and content of the movie. Was just constantly having to defend it against the other trash civil war. So I wasn't able to discuss these types of things with others.,2
"Absolutely. For me, they took the plot lines to two movies and mashed them together into one crowded mess.  Batman v Superman should have been one movie. Death of superman, with Doomsday should have been another movie.  The DC movies in general just showed that they were desperate to catch up with Marvel at all costs, without taking the time to lay down the groundwork with setting up plots.",1
BvS is the only Batman film that actually confronts Batman about killing and makes him realize why it's wrong and how he slipped up. Nolan's and Burton's films had far more kills but their films didn't acknowledge it,3
"Batman killed in the Tim Burton movies by roasting criminals with the afterburner of the Batmobile.  Batman killed in Batman #1, dated 1940.  Batman locked KGBeast in a sewer and left him to die.  Batman has killed in many situations and people choose to forget that as a way to hate BvS.  &#x200B;  Edit: It's also heavily implied that Batman kills the Joker in The Killing Joke. I don't know where you got this ""Batman never killed"" idea haha",3
"Lol? How is it 'recklessly' killing or atleast intensively injuring a bunch of mercenaries shooting at him with mounted machine gun turrets?. Where's that issue, if you're going to keep trying to compare to other Batman's try and pick one that doesn't actually kill...oh wait. Yeah they mostly all do. Even Clooneys batmobile with a friggin rocket launcher probably did.   Because, Nolan's batman kills a bunch of people, and lets them just die... You do know that, right?.   The same b.s. things people try to argue over and over again. I don't know wtf you're trying to encourage here??.",3
U think the general audience hate comes from that?,2
> The most accurate would be in The Dark Knight when Batman throws Sal Mlone off a fire escape.  [Some time before that scene....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYqlI9mdtVA&feature=youtu.be&t=156),1
"Batman has killed people in literally every movie. He cracks a smile when he blows a guy up in returns. He also has killed in multiple comics, even when he has had his ""no kill"" rule he still brutalizes and cripples countless people. We should feel better he will break someone's spine rather than kill them? I mean c'mon. He allows ras aghul to die and is directly responsible for the events that cause his death. He was soo adamant he couldn't kill the prisoner with the league of shadows yet he burns the fucking building down lol. While this prisoner is still restrained and more than likely stuck in there. The bvs interpretation was very much in line with TDKR version of the character. Him being wreck less and violent was literally the point and wasn't supposed to be seen as a good thing. He was supposed to be seen as a seriously damaged Batman losing his way.",1
"Keaton's Batman literally shot and dropped bombs on hengemen, watch Mr Sunday movies video on Batmans killcount. Also this Batman is closer to the Dark Knight Returns Batman which actually kills, he kills the Joker by then end and that's the whole arc of Batman in BvsS, Batman has become one of the evils of the world and tries to become good again by the end, I wouldn't had done a JL movie afterwards but a Batman & Robin movie where we see him as brutal when fighting but no more borderline psychopathic killing.",1
You're completely entitled to think so.,2
"oh, I missed that! I'll have to check it out",1
I think it ruins the suspension of disbelief that you need in order to enjoy Batman and Superman's secret identities.  All of the interesting development of Lex Luther as a character happened before the movie. He's the Villain! And he decided to kill superman offscreen!,1
"I think the Flash was already active. He put Captain Boomerang in prison around the time Superman died, so Lex just used that logo.",3
A super-speed metahuman that flings fuckloads of lightning around when he uses said super-speed.,2
Cyborg isn't hard to justify at all. Lex had access to Cadmus and Star Labs,1
Also Flash was already active. There were other videos about Flash in the folder.,1
No they're part of what inspires Wonder Woman to not stay hidden and intercede. I get why it's in the film as opposed to after the credits.  BUT its placement in the film absolutely kills the flow. The scene should have happened *before* Bruce starts training.,1
Why would he create logos for the superheroes?,3
Why did his super-secret files have their logos on them?,3
As people have mentioned the Logos is really stupid. Does Lex also sell their merch? Plus having the supervillain find out the hero's identity is a really interesting and cool storyline that is now thrown away because Lex knows and has always known. It's as if everyone in the world knew Spider-Man's identity in the first movie but it also didn't have any real consequences. Lex knowing everyone's identity changes nothing about the moive other than to be stupid. IMO,2
"Definitely agreed, the long time frame only makes the chance of discovery go up.",2
"If its a large group of people that actually makes it easier to unravel in my opinion. At that point it‚Äôs finding the right person and applying proper leverage. Lex has enough money and sociopathic tendencies to bribe or torture or chemically induce the truth.  I think you can rule out criminal ties when you take into account the sheer volume of criminals, again if he were funded by a specific crime group that makes him easier to find, and criminals are even easier to buy.  This is also adding the fact as was pointed out elsewhere Lex has had 20 years of intel gathering.",1
"You mean, 'do think', right?.",0
But the same people would bitch if it were a page for page adaptation saying why don't they gave any creativity. Each author does things different with each character and that's all the movies are too. I used to hate xmen because rogue was more jubilee than rogue but accepted that it was their own take and not just live action 90s cartoon that I loved. But some of the X-Men movies are definitely stinkers,1
Ok millennial,1
Lol boomer. I'm sure almost people here was born in the nineties. Go and hide under your beanbag will you.,2
"Firstly, Snyder does respect the source material and made films exploring poignant ideas well  [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg8Gda\_PKkdf0NaoX59KT1oiqoWFGbf37](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg8Gda_PKkdf0NaoX59KT1oiqoWFGbf37)  &#x200B;  Secondly, 3 hours is more than enough for the material",1
"Not that I think I'll necessarily change your opinion, but I do think you're scraping at the surface of that scene.  Going through the film, we see a jaded, angry Bruce constantly suffering nightmares and PTSD like behaviour from the death of his parents. Multiple times we see an emphasis on his mother's death, be it his father's dying words or his nightmare in front of his mother's grave, he's clearly tormented by it.  This is furthered by the scenes where Bruce is talking to Alfred about the history of his family and how he's now older than his parents ever were.  Working from there, we see Lex taunting him over this throughout the film, notes like ""You let your family die"" etc. timed with Superman at the forefront of a national tragedy yet again (with Bruce **AGAIN** feeling powerless to stop it).  Then Lex starts pitting Clark against Bruce, sending him clues to more of Batman's latest victims, organising to have the branded guy shanked in jail.  So all this pitting of the two together, Bruce sees Superman as the enemy. He's gotten in Bruce's way, he's been the cause of cataclysmic events and some truly horrific acts of terrorism.  By this point, all we've seen from Bruce is his anger towards Superman, his view of him as a threat and absolutely no acknowledgement that Superman is a person too  ""You're not a god, you were never even a man""  This is Bruce's perspective throughout the entire film, that Superman is just an alien, a false god bringing chaos to a place he doesn't belong. He sees him not as a person with a family, loved ones and something to protect but just some arrogant figure who does what he wants.  So fast forward to the Martha scene, where Superman has tried to reason with him and fought back only in self-defense. We get to Clark's dying breath Kryptonite in his face, sputtering out words between breaths he can't catch with a boot crushing his throat.  ""You're letting him kill Martha. Save Martha"". Immediately flashes to Bruce's parents dying, his father's dying words mirroring Clarks, he's standing on the throat of someone who didn't come to fight but came to save someone, and all that person cares about is saving someone else - meanwhile Bruce is about to KILL an unarmed person who's not fighting back - a murder in cold blood.  After about 2 minutes of this scene carrying out btw, heavy flashback scenes, Bruce becoming paranoid, looking around, freaking out majorly expecting *something* to happen*. He thinks he's being played and is losing his shit.  Lois comes rushing in screaming bloody murder, calling Clark by his real name, begging Bruce to stop, saying that it's his mother's name.  You think fucking Batman - **BATMAN** - in that instance would just kill Clark anyway? All signs point towards Clark coming for help, only fighting back when he needs to, and then begging for Batman to save his mother in his dying breath. And you think Batman in all his 20 years experience just goes ""lmao nah fuck this alien"" and stabs him? The entire movie, Alfred is telling him he's not the enemy, Bruce has spent 2 years tracking Superman's interventions - with logic and not blinded by rage he could easily tell Superman is legitimately trying to do good.  tl;dr the entire movie set up Bruce as a tragic, PTSD struck, struggling Batman in a world that's left him behind. On the verge of killing someone in cold blood, for no greater good, with literally any other alternative, he overcomes his rage and distrust of Superman, finally seeing him as a real person with a life, loved ones he wants to protect and not some alien who sees himself as a false god.",1
Well with that surface level understanding of the movie I‚Äôd hate it too,1
Batman's conflict wasn't a conflict. If he had been wrestling with the idea of taking a life instead of just... being a killer already... then the scene where he can't do it because Superman is calling for his mother would actually make sense. Batman is over the edge murdering people before the movie starts; that he would pull back because the guy is asking for his mother is a completely stupid plot twist.,0
Didn't he throw a box at a dude and stabbed another?,1
"Okay, then everyone in the Arkham games is dead cause they get messed up way worse than the crate dude.",1
"Yeah, but it's implied he'a been majorly fucking people up with lines something along the lines of ""The Bat's gotten mad,"" or other (been a while since I rewatched). He's probably been killing for months if not years as of BvS",1
Mark Waid would disagree,0
What do you not get?. Batman/Bruce had no idea that lex knew his identity...  Lex is slyly letting him know that he's aware of who he truly is.,1
He knew he was being manipulated when he almost killed Clark.,1
Yes but that has nothing to do with him being Bruce Wayne. It sounds like he just said it because bats live in caves,0
Remember to avoid screwing up the timeline as well,3
You‚Äôre fun,1
What's great is that fans of the movie keep posting stuff like this and do the bashing for us.,1
I know I was.,1
"Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, etc.",0
Are you referring to Marvel's Civil War as trash in comparison to BvS? Civil War is a personal favorite but bias aside that movie at least was more coherent than BvS. That was a mess of a film that tried to do way too much.,2
"I want to give you five more upvotes.  Yes, it seems that so-called ""comic book fans"" don't actually have a problem with Batman killing, but they are uncomfortable about how the movie showed the unintended consequences of a vigilante going out at night and ""exacting justice.""    The film is a deconstruction of both characters, it shows that people are dying from his lethal force but Bruce is losing his way to realize it.  The point is to get to why this man does what he does, and what drives him.  It's the Watchmen approach, and if you don't like it, fine.  But it's still out of respect and love for the characters.",3
In the 1989 movie toward the end he kicks the sword guy down a several hundred foot belltower shaft.,3
"And let's be real, there's no way the Burton Batman *wouldn't* know how flat-out shackling Joker to a statue while he hangs from a helicopter is gonna end.",2
"The real ""rule"" if there is one, is actually murder.  Batman has ""killed"" people in the crosshairs countless times.",1
He also straps a bomb to a guys chest and throws him down a well in Batman Returns.   He also kills Two Face in Batman Forever. There is no way he threw all those coins in the air not knowing what would happen after he did.,1
"The big issue isn't that he *has* killed, but that he's not *supposed* to kill. They put that rule into effect very early on back in the 40s because it made him more interesting, yet so many people have him kill because...reasons? You'd think that, by now, DC would have developed a series bible about which aspects of a character's personality could be fucked with and which couldn't. Batman killing should be something with massive in-universe repercussions for decades, not a one-off blip from some edgy writer.",0
"This. And everytime we bring the dark knight up nobody replies lol, batman has killed several times in the past, only this time it was meant for a more general audience.",3
"I disagree. Firstly, Clark has used Lexcorp trucks in MoS. Bruce has been active for 20 years. It's not that much of a stretch  &#x200B;  Secondly, Again, Lex has figured out their identities in comics before.  &#x200B;  Thirdly, Sure, we are told more of what Lex wants and is like than shown it. But Lex still develops as he gains Krypton's knowledge. Plus, adding in flashback scenes of Lex's past is unnecessary. We already have a full story in action",0
"I completely forgot about that. You're right. Now that I think of it, I'm pretty sure his suit was on display when Bruce went to recruit him in JL too.",1
Exactly. Thank you,1
"Yeah that's a good point. Even still, I think it's ridiculous people get this up in arms about it regardless of how much sense it makes. I understand having little nitpicks with a film, but a major flaw? Come on. It has no bearing on the actual plot or story. It's just a neat easter egg that they thought fans would appreciate. Wrongfully so, apparently.",1
"What I mean is she still sees them, but we don't until the end.",1
1. Because it's easier to file them without revealing its content 2. Because the only superhero in those files to actually use the logo is Barry 3. Because it was a nice easter egg and you took it too seriously.,3
"I mean, I create custom folder icons for organization. It's just being a neat person.",2
Far be it for a genius whos main profession is business to have natural inclinatiins to towards marketing and branding.  Creating logos would probably be as easy as breathing for him.  Its not much of a stretch to think he might of even had an idea towards monetizing heros before being destabalized by the idea of Superman.,1
"Cause it looks friggin' cool, that's why.",1
To make them easier to identify??.,0
Because it's easier.,0
Lex knowing everyone's identity just shows the high level of leverage he has on them and would've been cool to see how it would've paid off in JL2.,2
>At that point it‚Äôs finding the right person and applying proper leverage.  Yeah but in order to get there you have to confirm first that it's a large group of people and not a single billionaire.,1
Nah I meant what I said. If Batman knew Superman‚Äôs identity he would‚Äôve already known his mom‚Äôs name. Obviously after that scene he knows.,1
"That's what I started thinking after amazing Spider-man, ""it's just another writer with another artist.""",1
">Firstly, Snyder does respect the source material  He put the Dark Knight Returns and the Death of Superman in the same goddamn movie. The fuck he does.",0
Stabbed a dude in the shoulder and threw a crate at a group that happened to hit a guy,1
"Not really. The crate guy's brain splattered against the wall. At the very worst, Batman caused concussions and broken bones in the Arkham Games. They really went the extra mile to make it look brutal, yet non-lethal.",1
"Probably? We don't have proff of that, we do know those prison executions where done by Lex",1
Let him. There have been many examples of comic writers agreeing or disagreeing with their film adaptations regardless of authenticity.  It doesn‚Äôt change the objective fact that this film takes heavy influence from Birthright as a major inspiration.,3
"Yeah, and Stephen King hates Kubrick's The Shining adaptation. Means nothing.",2
Ha! And for my next trick...,1
"I was very in touch with BvS media both before its release, during it, and long after and this is the very first time I‚Äôve ever seen this pointed out. Can you source it?",1
"yes I was. Bias aside, it's coherent??. Your bias was not put aside. The avengers were done over by a man in a rubber mask?!. Really?. Surveillance in the middle of nowhere, which wasn't there before for Starks parents death. Bp always popping out of nowhere?!... Sorry, just no lol. The level of coherency you speak of is non-existent my friend.",0
Exactly. Another good example.,3
"I get bummed over people getting irritated about an interpretation of a character. Why does the movie version have to have the exact origin as the original comic? Snyder clearly likes the Frank Miller shit and I can‚Äôt fault him for that. It rocks. Surely you know as well as I do that character traits change, especially over 80 years. Why is it so difficult to picture the DCEU as an Elseworlds story? Doing something different with the characters such as mixing and matching traits that you enjoy but recognize might be controversial, is a bold move. It sadly didn‚Äôt pay off box-office-wise or critically, but I can say with confidence Zack made me give a shit about Superman for the first time in years. He made him human and brought legitimate struggle to him. It only makes sense that he tried the same with Batman! Just my opinion, of course :)",1
Dude exactly! Every time someone brings up any killing in the Nolan movies.. crickets hahaha,1
">I disagree. Firstly, Clark has used Lexcorp trucks in MoS. Bruce has been active for 20 years. It's not that much of a stretch  You dont understand what suspension of disbelief means. It is OBVIOUS that Bruce Wayne is Batman. And in order to make it so that everyone who cant just figure it out ISNT just a massive idiot, you need to act like it's actually a good secret.   So he needs to figure it out, with information the public doesnt have access to.  Or you can do what Snyder did, and make a movie where literally every major character is stupid.     >  >Secondly, Again, Lex has figured out their identities in comics before.   Nobody cares what happened in completely unrelated stories.   >Plus, adding in flashback scenes of Lex's past is unnecessary  Yeah it's better to have the CHARACTER DIRECTING THE EVENTS OF THE MOVIE to be a minor character with his development off screen.   >We already have a full story in action  We have a shitty story that pulls Doomsday out of its ass because the main villain sucked too much to even be the final villain.",1
Mmhmm you're right about that.,1
"Easter eggs are meant to be hidden to find, not thrown in your face.",3
Cyborg uses it at the end of JL. It happens to end up matching Aquaman‚Äôs suit.,1
"I mean, he could use filenames to identify them. The question is: where did he get the logos? Was he workshopping identifiable logos for their branding?",2
And you can rule out the billionaires using the above mentioned methods.,1
"Firstly, He didn‚Äôt put them exactly. He took influence from them. The situation isn‚Äôt exactly as how you described.  Secondly, comic book films mix stuff like this all the time",1
"Isn't that the same as saying ""I shot a gun and the bullet happened to hit that guy""?",0
"No, we saw some blood, we didn't see brain splattered against the wall though. 90% of people in Arkham are either dead or permanently brain damaged. Hell, I'll bring up other movies like all the cars Bruce ran over in TDK (There are people who had to die from that), and the fact that Keaton unlike Affleck ENJOYED murder. Keaton smiled while blowing goons up. Affleck at least has remorse and has the ""men are still good"" moment.",1
"The idea is that Batman still branded them when he seemingly knew that brand would get them killed in jail. He didn't directly kill them, but he didn't care if someone else did.",1
"To be fair King appreciates the direction and aesthetic he just hates how it deviated from his book so much, which it did.",1
"Remember, Only Thawne can manipulate the timeline to get what he wants.",1
I do remember people posting about it on this sub after the dvd came out. Don‚Äôt remember seeing it outside this sub though,1

"I said ""more coherent"" compared to BvS. It's got its own share of plot holes i'm sure but Rubber Mask =Baron Zemo?

">I get bummed over people getting irritated about an interpretation of a character. Why does the movie version have to have the exact origin as the original comic?   Because these are iconic figures with clearly defined origins that set them on a certain path, and people care about these characters.  >Snyder clearly likes the Frank Miller shit and I can‚Äôt fault him for that. It rocks. Surely you know as well as I do that character traits change, especially over 80 years.   I agree, TDKR was awesome. It's an interesting take on a Batman who's been worn down after 30+ years as a vigilante in a world that's moved on from him. But when you start a new universe, you need to start from zero. In BvS, they gave us a Batman at the end of his journey. Literally every major storyline and character that shaped and defined him is in the past, all off-screen, and all we get is vague hints about it. BvS single-handedly torpedoed our chances of ever seeing like, 15 huge arcs from Batman & Superman's histories.  Yes, characters can change over time, but we didn't get to see that with Superman and Batman because Warner wanted a fat payday without doing any of the necessary legwork. Snyder is so obsessed with ""deconstruction"" that he forgot that you need to *construct* a thing before you can tear it down. The most successful DCEU movies so far have been Shazam, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman. Not surprisingly, they're the ones that all start the characters from as close to zero as possible and do a traditional origin story with a fleshed-out arc, not just a bunch of crap slammed together to look edgy and cool while requiring the audience's knowledge of TDKR, Death In The Family, etc. to fill in the blanks that they didn't feel like going over.  >Why is it so difficult to picture the DCEU as an Elseworlds story? Doing something different with the characters such as mixing and matching traits that you enjoy but recognize might be controversial, is a bold move.  No, it's not. Not for DC. They've taken to using ""eLsEwOrLdS"" to hand-wave their various fuck-ups and creative laziness for a while now and I'm sick of it. Marvel is only now - 10 years and 24 movies in - starting to toy with a multiverse, because they recognized the need to build a coherent main universe first.   If DC had piggybacked off of Marvel's formula, we'd be a phase or two away from a blockbuster-level adaptation of Crisis On Infinite Earths. Instead, the movies are struggling to limp through a scattershot, incohesive Phase Two while the CW DC shows (that are borderline Tumblr ship fics half the time) are about to do a 5-hour COIE adaptation and you know what? *It's going to be fucking great*. Because, again, they laid the groundwork for it. They've spent almost 10 years introducing Green Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, Atom, Black Canary, etc. and sowing the seeds of this massive story that actually uses ""Elseworlds"" as a competent narrative device instead of a way to excuse some gymbro ""auteur"" and his mountain of failed edgelord bullshit.",1
Now we have even rules for easter eggs...,0
Reshoot. It doesn't count.,1
"Well we learn at the end of Justice League he is trying to put together his own team of super powered beings, and invites Slade to join. It's very possible, and probably pretty likely, the workshopping tied into that team. The files he had in BvS were all for beings who had not yet become public heroes.",1
"He could have done, but he also didn't have to. It also gives the audience familiarity with those symbols now...",1

"No. Good films can also pull from a variety of sources regardless of how inherently incompatible they may seem on the surface. Because the job isn't to combine the stories as is.

Raimi's Spider-Man: Mixes the comics of the time with mostly the 60's and 70's.  &#x200B;  * The plot of [*Black Panther*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018) is largely drawn from Don McGregor's ""Panther's Rage"" arc from [The '70s](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies) (Killmonger igniting a violent insurrection in Wakanda, which leads to a duel with T'Challa atop Warrior Falls), but also has story elements and major characters taken from from [Christopher Priest](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPriestComics) (Nakia and Okoye) and Reginald Hudlin's (Shuri) respective runs. Some of the visuals (namely the new Black Panther suit) were also taken from the very recent run by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreeze. * [*Avengers: Infinity War*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar) is an adaptation of *The Thanos Quest* and [*The Infinity Gauntlet*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheInfinityGauntlet), but takes elements from [*Infinity*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Infinity) as well in order to make Thanos' plot tied more closely to Earth. It also has elements of [*Annihilation*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Annihilation) and [*Secret Invasion*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion). * [*Captain Marvel*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019) combines the title character's origin story with elements lifted from [The Kree/Skrull War](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKreeSkrullWar). * [*Avengers: Endgame*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame), like *Infinity War*, draws from *The Infinity Gauntlet*, but the [Time](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel) [Heist](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaper) which takes up much of the middle section has a similar premise to [*Avengers Forever*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersForever), with additional elements cribbed from [J. Michael Straczynski](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski)'s run on [*The Mighty Thor*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor), [*Fear Itself*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FearItself), [*The Ultimates*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates) volume 3, and Rick Remender's run on [*Captain America*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica).  [*The Dark Knight Trilogy*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy) combines and rearranges elements from many famous [*Batman*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman) storylines.  * [*Batman Begins*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins) drew inspiration from three different storylines: [*Batman: Year One*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne), [*The Long Halloween*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween) and *The Man Who Falls*. * [*The Dark Knight*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight) drew inspiration from [*The Killing Joke*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke), *The Long Halloween* and [The Joker](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker)'s original debut in 1940. * [*The Dark Knight Rises*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises) drew inspiration from [*Batman: No Man's Land*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand), [*Knightfall*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall) and [*Batman: The Dark Knight Returns*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns).",1

The reason why Marvel movies are the only ones on the list that did a decent job with any of that source material (and I wouldn't include all of the ones listed as good) is because none of the Marvel movies tried to do it in one movie.

"I mean... Maybe? But there's no way that crate guy didn't have a fractured skull and severe internal bleeding at the absolute minimum. My point is that it was gratuitous. In the Arkham games, Bruce just kinda wails on some guys with his bare hands (and some knuckle protectors obviously), but it can all be seen as a means to incapacitate, even with the broken arms and legs.   But in BvS he grapples an entire crate (with God knows how much stuff in it) and throws it at a guy's head. The intention couldn't have been to merely incapacitate and it most probably didn't.",1
The full cut is 214 minutes. The intended Theatrical Cut would've been 170 minutes.,3
Didn't Snyder say it was 214mins?,3
It's 214 minutes. Zack told us at the SnyderCon event back in March for his birthday.,2
It's confirmed 214mins or 3hrs and 34mins,1

214 All day everyday.,1
214. All day everyday.,1
After all these BtS reveals. I‚Äôm starting to understand why WB wanted to cut it up. There was WAY to much going on in this movie,1
If it‚Äôs anything like BvS: too long,0
"Thanks, that was primarily what I was trying to determine. Do you think with a 3 1/2 hour runtime WB could convince theatres to play the full Snyder Cut for longer than just one weekend?",2
I did read that but at 3 1/2 hours there‚Äôs no way that could‚Äôve been his intended theatrical cut. Snyder knows how to make big crowd pleasing movies and although a lot of fans would enjoy sitting through a 3 1/2 hour movie that‚Äôs a lot to ask of the average film goers who I‚Äôm sure he still keeps in mind. To me it sounds like 214 minutes was always going to be a directors cut but even he had a shorter movie in mind for original release.,3
"Getting the same feeling, it sounds incredibly bloated.",1
Did you like avengers endgame??...,1
"Maybe, but only for a limited time and limited theaters, and probably US only. Although one can hope they will think about EU folks too.",2
"Theatrical cut? Definitely not, but Snyder doesn't really make movies for that, he makes them for himself. His JL was 214 mins long, the TC probably would have been closer to 2 1/2 - 3 hrs, but that's pretty much just speculation on my part",2
"You say Endgame, I say Return of the King.  200 minutes regular edition that movie. God knows the extended edition is like 4 hrs long.  And yet we all still love that movie.",2
"I just mean from Dawn of The Dead, Watchmen, Sucker Punch, 300 & Man of Steel he made a lot of movies with more standard movie runtimes but I‚Äôm sure he has much longer extended versions of those films as well.",1
"I mean, his complete version of Watchmen is incredibly long. And with these movies he wanted to achieve a lot, and that requires a long run time, BvS was more than 3 hours originally and so was JL, he likely had ideas about what to cut for a TC but his directors cuts are what he considers to be his film",1
I don't think they really get How 70s New York worked.,2
"It's simple: If Arthur was treated nicer, there would be no Joker.",2
The bit with Arthur and the Waynes actually made me tear up a bit. Also I loved how the villains at the end were all time appropriate.,2
"This is the paradox isn't it. Even had Arthur been adopted by the Wayne's is their fate a set one? Do they still get murdered and Arthur snaps for this reason, becoming Joker. We've seen in Flashpoint even if the Wayne's live a Batman and Joker still exist.",1
That‚Äôs because Gotham City is cursed to like a supernatural degree,1
"There are alternate universes where the Joker is good. Take the one from ""CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS"" for instance. ""Jester"" was a member of the Justice League.",1
Still don‚Äôt know what to think of this movie . I feel like it could go either way .,3
WHY DOES DINAH HAVE A BAT?!?!? She‚Äôs supposed to have her canary cry and her badass martial arts to back her up,3
I feel nothing for this DC project. This is the first DC project I‚Äôve felt this way about. I hope it‚Äôs truly good and change my mind.,3
I can already tell this is just going to be a Harley Quinn movie and not do any of the other characters any justice.,3
Oh look it's that movie about Harley Quinn that features some of the Birds Of Prey where Harley is the leader rather Black Canary or Oracle/Batgirl.,2
I think Harley works best as a supporting character. We'll see how this movie goes but I would have much preferred that Harley would have been lined up alongside the OG badass Black Canary and Huntress with Barbara Gordon calling the shots.   You can have them recruit Harley because she knows a lot about the guy they are chasing down. Because the Joker dealt with him frequently.,3
Why is it even called BoP?,2
üòªüòªüòª trailer 2 incoming.,3
Sheesh am I the only one excited for this? I thought the last trailer looked really great,3
Cassandra Cain looks like a Foot Clan reject from the 1990 TMNT movie.  Oof.,2
. . . Pass  Literally nothing I‚Äôve seen or heard from this movie so far has me even the slightest bit interested in seeing it.,3
Wild Prediction: Renee Montoya will be the best character in the film.  I also think while  Black Canary is being criticized the hardest by fans she‚Äôll be the breakout star.,3
"December 2018 : Aquaman releases and breaks a billion dollars.   4 month later Shazam releases - underperforms   October 2019 : Joker releases, breaks a billion dollars.   3-4 month later birds of prey releases and ... ?",3
DC doesn't give up on these kinds of movies?,2
everyone looks bland and lifeless except for Harley,2
Which character is the person in the blue shirt?,2
i don't think this will be a bad film but it looks like a  really bad comic book movie in terms of adapting the source material. Caine seems to bare zero resemblance to her other than being asian. Huntress doesn't have a proper costume.  There are also rumors that EVERYONE in the film kills including Black Canary. Idk man.,2
"It feels so over the top but in the wrong way. It doesnt look horrible, but its far away from exciting.  Besides Harley, everyone looks like whatever. Also they are photoshopped into the picture. It doesnt feel natural at all",1
I didn‚Äôt even know Black Canary was in this movie. Who is playing her? This movie is gonna fail and fail hard. Somehow DC took a very simple and easy to pull of premise and shit all over it. Pretty much none of them look like their comic counterparts except Harley and even that‚Äôs a stretch. This is why Marvel owns DC in the theater even though I am a big DC fan.,2
Still think this looks dumb and I don‚Äôt buy her as Quinn. That dynamite scene in the trailer is very terrible.,1
Omg they look terrible it looks like some damn CW series in the works. This movie gonna flop.,1
"These girls look liked they've been plucked out of completely different movies.   -Huntress looks like she had the same budget as Kickass.   -Montoya looks like she would be the crooked cop in a David Ayer flick.   -Black Canary, recent run or not, looks like absolute trash. This is possibly the most badass women in the DCEU with martial arts competency that could rival the best of the DC universe. That ain't it.   -Cassandra Cain...I don't even know what I am looking at.   -Harley Quinn may have had a meteoric rise but the fall may be even more dangerous. The further we stray from character is the second fans rebel.",2
Cassandra and that smug aura lol.,3
"I‚Äôm sorry, but this looks like a dumpster fire.",3
"Only problem with a big actress playing lead is everyone is going to be pushed to the back and hardly any focus on them, this is going to be a Harley Quinn movie featuring birds of prey, which is cool as Margot Robbie is fantastic but be nice to see more variety.",2
They really made the birds of prey supporting characters in their own movie....üò≠üò≠üò≠,2
"I feel like they forgot a movie,  there should have been Joker and Harley before her emancipation.",1
"This could end up being a great movie...for simple people but not for me. After seeing everything so far from it, it weird saying I have zero interest in watching this movie. I was rather hoping wb would explore other things instead.",1
Imagine if the Hyena just started mauling them lmao.,1
Superhero costume in a superhero movie ? No ? Only my me ?,1
This reboot of That 70s Show looks lit as fuck...,1
I‚Äôm waiting for the reviews,1
Look at what they did to my Cassie Cane,1
This looks very shitty,1
"I feel like this movie isn't really going to focus on who the characters really are, it's gonna be like 5 random girls doing random illegal stuff. I hope my mind is changed when I see it but I don't have high hopes for it.",1
"What, is Black Canary relegated to using Harley's unwanted tools now?",1
"i was looking forward to this movie.. but the way they look does nothing for me, they look nothing like the characters i grew up reading for years.   That doesnt mean this movie wont be entertaining but i hate the way they look.",1
That 70s Show vibes,2
Trash I‚Äôm not excited for this film at all.,2
"Good god, that is just so, SO bad",2
I‚Äôm a DC fan. Hardcore lifelong DC fan. This is the first DC movie I have absolutely no desire in seeing :(,3
Ehh no thanks. Everything I‚Äôve seen about this looks unoriginal and boring.,2
All these costumes look like crap honestly. Hopefully Margot can go 2 for 2 when it comes to saving a DC film she's in.,2
Charlie's ocean 70s show.,1
Is the background made up of clown-esque handkerchiefs or am I reaching?,1
"I am actually excited, love Margot as Harley. I don't expect masterpiece like Joker but I hope it will be fun movie.",1
"I'm excited to some extent for this movie but when I watched the trailer it didn't  move me the first time. I'm more in tune with Black Mask, Huntress, and Black Canary. I feel like Ewan Mcregor is going to crush it. I want to feel that mob presence from him. This movie just feels like SS 2.0. Hopefully it proves me wrong.",1
Yeah no thanks didn‚Äôt know Hot Topic was hiring.,1
I don't know what any of this is supposed to be. I see a hyena on a couch and a bunch of post-it notes on a wall. I don't get it.,2
"This looks ducking horrible and low rent. What‚Äôs with Rose Tico wearing the *vatos locos, esse* bandana?",2
At least there's the 'Birds of Prey' on this one.,2
I don‚Äôt remember this episode of That ‚Äò70s Show,2
Imagine if we were getting a Superman or GLC movie instead of this right now,1
I know it‚Äôs just one person but I‚Äôm not gonna go see this for different reasons.,1
"Oh, the Community College girls!",2
"Can't support a film that say their going ""lecture Men"" seriously who does he think he is",1
Should have been released this image from the start lol,2
I don‚Äôt know what I think about Katie Holmes as Harley Quinn,2
Still feel very meh about this movie.  And it's really missing a certain babs.,2
"I don't understand how people think it's going to bomb before knowing much about the film. Wait until it's released to judge it. Even though it isn't comic accurate in some aspects, that won't be an issue for the GA.",2
**WUHHMAN** POWER,1
Absolute Garbage,1
Is that bud or lou?,1
"I love Margot Robbie but I don't understand why the marketing team is afraid to use the other characters. People love MEW, Jurnee and Rosie.",1
"I‚Äôm in just cause of harleys hyenas, the fact they went through with them is enough for me",1
"Omg it‚Äôs the cop from Pineapple Express, just realized this üòÇüòÇ",1
I want to see some DCEU cameos in this.,1
Who is the woman in blue? I'm guessing the one with the bat is Canary. Also not a huge fan of Harley's outfit,1
"If you show this to anyone who reads comics and let them guess who's who. The best that anyone could do is maybe Harley and maaaaaaaybe huntress if they notice the crossbow and the purple tint.  But the rest of them are unrecognizable. To me, that is bad design if you can't at least stick to color palettes of comic book characters.",1
"This movie already looks terrible. DC needs to fire their entire movie production staff. This will bomb, bet my life on it.",0
This movie is going to be great. I can feel it,1
"I'm not even interested to know who is which character. I hope this doesn't include the huntress. Kinda wanna see her badass comic accurate mask,not this reimagined version.",0
[I‚Äôm actually very excited for this movie](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/I-Know-Fuck-Me-Right.jpg),1
"Not impressed from what I've seen so far. Still going to support the film, but I'm worried.",1
All of you complaining will end up liking Huntress,1
It looks like it is made for female demographic audience.,1
I‚Äôm so fucking tired of all the hate this film is getting.   1) just because you‚Äôre not interested in the movie does not mean it‚Äôs gonna be bad.   2) None of you have even seen the movie. So you have no literal idea of the film‚Äôs quality.  EDIT: All of these downvoted just prove exactly what I‚Äôm talking about.,0
What‚Äôs this a movie that isn‚Äôt the Snyder Cut? what is this doing here?,0
If it‚Äôs as lame as the first one...,0
My waifu Huntress lookin cool AF,0
"I'm gonna say this here and now, I'm more excited for this film than almost any other DC film in the next decade.   Superhero films being dark and gritty for the sake of being dark and gritty has become boring, and I'm glad this is going in that crazy technicolour direction, and with a central character who fits that motif. I want more unique and interesting takes on superheroes we all know and love, not the same films churned out over and over again.  Hell, I'm starting to like Joel Schumacher's Batman films for what they were, they actually had colour and style to them.",0
I'm heavily worried after the trailer that showed that Cassandra Cain is apparently just some random normal girl?,3
"From what I've seen, it seems like it's going to be an uphill battle for anyone other than Harley Quinn to stand out. I wouldn't mind something like this as a Harley Quinn movie, but I kind of wish we got a less HQ focused Birds of Prey movie.",3
"I just hope the things I‚Äôve heard about the movie aren‚Äôt true. If any of the ‚ÄúBlack Mask is ultimately after his own nude pictures and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs chasing Cassandra Cain‚Äù type stuff is true then idk about this one, it could be another rough time for the DCEU",3
I think its going to be a wonderful time at the theater lol,3
Same.  If it‚Äôs no worse than SS quality I‚Äôd take it lol,1
I haven't seen anything yet that makes me think it'll be good.  But that's just my opinion.  I really hope I'm wrong and it's awesome though.,1
"A statement for any movie.   ""How's the new Star Wars looking?"" ""Eh, could go either way""",1
It physically pains me to see it too.,2
"I'm wholly unenthused, also. And here's the kicker: I love Harley. I was excited for her follow up project. But between the nonsensical mix of HQ with the Birds of Prey (a team I love from the comics); the fact that they appear to be pulling from comic runs I personally didn't care for (Harley's solo series, Canary's 'I'm a rockstar/crime fighter' series); the lacklustre (being generous) and unrecognisable ""costume"" design; what they've done to Cassandra (my favourite Batgirl); what they've done with Black Mask and the rumoured plot with the whole USB diamond thing... It's all adding up to 'Nope' for *moi*.  Roll on **The Suicide Squad**.",3
Yea. I feel exactly the same way. I'm sure I'll still see it in the theater but I have zero excitement or any real care for it.,3
Same. But I guess that's a good thing? Coz I'm more likely to enjoy it due to low expectations. Unless it is really bad.,3
This is exactly how I felt about the Joker film. I‚Äôm actually much more excited for this than I was for Joker. Different strokes I guess.,2
"Same, and it's because we don't need this movie... We want a Flash movie or Green Lantern or any other character that can contribute to this movie universe. I still hope this movie to be decent.",3
I feel the same way. I was pretty excited when this was first announced but the more I see of it the less interested I get. This has Suicide Squad vibes all over it and it‚Äôs pretty underwhelming.,2
It really doesn‚Äôt look any different than Suicide Squad. Just has more of a ‚Äòfuck Jared Letos Joker‚Äô vibe. Lol I wonder if he will throw a fit over this movie too.,1
I want to see an Ambush Bug DC movie.,1
Pretty much the same myself. The only thing I'm really interested in is Daniel Pemberton's score. So happy he's been landing bigger projects  recently.,1
"Same, have a bad feeling they will over do the 'bad ass/edgy female who has no time for mens bullshit' trope",1
Not the only one either lol it‚Äôs cause no one really asked for this movie they just assumed it‚Äôd be something everyone wanted. Just hope it‚Äôs good,1
Still more excited for this than WW84,0
What are we...some type of Birds of Prey squad?,2
"[Or, y'know...](https://i.redd.it/p5hh91a08pm01.jpg)",3
Birds of Prey....,1
5th of december,1
I think as a movie this looks great. I just wish as a comic book adaptation it'd look a little more recognizable.,3
YOU ARE NOT ALONE,3
"No, I'm pretty damn excited as well",3
nobody is giving actual criticism to the film as a film. they're just upset it doesn't look like the comics they read. that's the only criticism that there is for this so far. The trailer is great and really gives you the theme and style of the film in those 2m,1
"I am excited, probably watched trailer 10 times already. Love Margot as Harley.",2
There with ya.,1
I'll admit I still think it's a toss up but agree that it was a fun trailer !,1
Excites for the film? Sure...maaaaybe. excited for what this film means for the greater implications of the DCU/first theatrical adaptations of the BoP/Cass? Not so much.  What are you excited or interested for? Are you a comic fan at all familiar with the Birds of Prey?,1
"Im on the train that thinks this movie will probably... Not be great. But so far I like what I see from Black Canary. I think people who are concerned about Cassandra Cain should be very worried.  I do hope I'm wrong, if this movies is awesome I'll be pleasantly surprised.",3
"Wait, Renee Montoya is in this? Like, the Question?",2
"But with Rosie Perez playing the part, I just can't get see that coming true.  Her voice is so repulsing it ruins her acting.  Like nails on a chalkboard.",1
"> Black Canary is being criticized the hardest by fans  They're obviously pulling from a recent run on the character, and it annoys me that people are getting upset over her because the run was really fun and interesting.",0
I don't know....maybe we are underestimating Harley Quinn/Margot Robbie. And I don't know if there's any other big movies coming out at the same time.,3
"Shazam underperformed because it was released between two marvel movie black holes. And against a budget of 80 to 100 million it earned 360 million, so I wouldn't say it really underperformed. I expect the sequel to do much better if WB decides to release it when there aren't other block busters to contend with.",2
 June 2020: WW84 releases & breaks a billion dollars,1
It's the first time they do a female team dark comedy movie,1
Renee montoya,2
The least they could've done is give them their iconic costumes. A slight variation in their masks/gear is fine but atleast TRY to make it recognizable for pete's sake!,1
Wait until the movie comes out. Test screenings have been very positive.,1
"Kickass is a great movie, I don't know why the comparation should be negative",0
"Oh yea. Unfortunately for DC Cinematic, it is gonna be terrible. Which is a shame considering they have been boomin' for the last 3.",2
"Lmao, it's truly a sad state of affairs atm",1
"Apparently we‚Äôre supposed to mark out for the hyenas?  Lots of reaction videos I‚Äôve seen on BoP bring up hyenas as some sort of big deal?    I dunno, I couldn‚Äôt give a fuck. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs one of those ‚ÄúI know what that is and I claaaaaaaapped‚Äù things.",2
Probably going to have to wait at least another Decade.,1
"People think it‚Äôs going to bomb because the marketing so far, for those people, has failed to convince them otherwise. It could end up being a great movie, but the posters, trailer, etc have all been horrible IMO. There‚Äôs not much more to understand.",2
Because DC = BAD!  /s,1
"Thank you, I am sick of negativity. Marvel fans always support Marvel movie and don't let anyone to shit on them.",0
Bruce,1
Most people dont even know Jurnee and her last name isnt particularly helpful.,2
No one knows Jurnee,0
Bad luck buddy.. the left girl is playing huntress,2
"Obviously, the same way Fast and Furious movies are made for straight men",0
"Thank you, I am sick of negativity.",0
"what are you talking about? Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam.. have not been ""Dark and gritty""  i dont understand people like you who keep saying that, then you completely lost me with Schumachers bullshit",1
For real. Cassandra Cain is one of my favorite superhero. It hurts seeing this highly skilled mute fighter just drinking slurpies and acting like a regular girl. She should be struggling to even speak,3
Same . I would have preferred a girl like X23 or something .,3
This seems like the case and it's horrible character assassination. Shit like that will break the movie.,3
"If I remember correctly, Mary Elizabeth Winstead revealed in one of her interviews that   the Huntress in the film has Cassandra Cain's personality/backstory. I may be wrong, since we know almost nothing about the rest of the characters but HQ. Hopeful the next trailer will give us some more info.",1
there's a lot of projecting going on here lol she was in all of 5 secs of a 2m trailer for a 2hr movie,0
It IS a HQ movie they just gave it a weird ass name so now we all expect Birds of Prey.,3
God that sounds fucking horrible if true . I would like to think there isn‚Äôt a chance in hell WB would green light a script like that .,2
"Thats sounds true, if its HC centric its gonna be true. Got to play for as many laughs as possible.",1
High bar you have their bud,1
That‚Äôs simply not true but to each their own .,1
I‚Äôm honestly hoping we‚Äôre all shocked by how good this movie turns out to be. Fingers crossed!,2
"""what they've done to Black Mask and Cassandra Cain"" ... you saw it?",0
"Kinda same boat. I was way more interested in this than Joker, but the trailers and info I've been seeing are not really doing anything to shore up that stance.",1
I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious this movie is made for a certain type of demographics. I get it and I hope it works out for WB.,2
you don't need any of these movies lol that argument is so stale.,0
"It has a different director and writer so you think it would be, Margot Robbie is producing though so if this falls flat it‚Äôs all on her.",1
"This is Katana, she‚Äôs not in this movie",1
I was being completely sarcastic. They are giving the impression that Harley is running show in this movie which as we know is not the case in ANY of the Birds Of Prey comics. Like she's never even been a member.,1
Honestly.,2
"Abbreviation- Noun  A shortened form of a word or phrase.   Yea, I got it",1
"> I think as a movie this looks great. I just wish as a comic book adaptation it'd look a little more recognizable.  That's exactly how I feel.  I'm excited, but by the looks of it, it feels more like a student film homage or something.  ""Eh, none of my friends look like the heroes and I don't have good costume budget, let's re-imagine them...""",3
"pretty much. I don't think it will be a bad film, but it looks like a terrible comic book movie",2
"Don‚Äôt want to offend anyone but as long as the movie is good, don‚Äôt really care if it‚Äôs comic accurate or not.",1
That's the whole point though! It's supposed to be similar to the comics we've all loved reading whilst growing up.    Without those key elements of familiarity this is simply another run-of-mill chick flick! lol,1
I think it‚Äôll probably be decent and because of low expectations it‚Äôll be overhyped. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it didn‚Äôt make a lot of money though. But being a Batman/Joker adjacent character may make Harley a big draw.,1
"Yes her, shes the cop in the blue shirt",3
"It‚Äôs very Brooklyn , and real. It works well  for a Gotham native. Plus she was hilarious as a cop in Pineapple Express. But she‚Äôs a very good character actress IMO.",1
"Well Reddit keeps telling me Sonic is the best movie ever made because they changed one design, so that‚Äôll *obviously* blow this out of the water.",3
"I really enjoyed her as Harley, and if Leto was in a better movie with a better team I‚Äôd have liked him too. I‚Äôm excited for this, but not anticipating much.",2
"Shazam fans have no reason to try to defend Shazam's BO gross against attacks from haters. We get a sequel + extended miniverse, so the haters can go eat shit",1
It might !,0
Kickass is absolutely awesome. I'm talking about suit design. Why does Huntress look like she had the same budget as him?,1
How the fuck do you know it‚Äôs gonna be a dumpster fire?,3
Not if you count The Kitchen.,1
AT-ST AT-ST AT-ST!,1
"They should just make a movie about hyenas and put it on National Geographic. It would probably be cheaper than making an expensive Birds of Prey movie, especially when it seems like the point is just to feature the hyenas. Why else would anyone see this? I'm going for the hyenas.",0
this poster is awful.,2
"because everyone shitting on this movie are marvel fans... just kidding.. kinda, Im a huge DC fan and dont think this movie will be good. I hope im wrong but it looks terrible from what i have seen so far.",1
She was on Ellen and Late night talk shows. She must be relevant.,1
"Oh yeah she's holding the crossbow, didn't notice. Goddamn it,I atleast hope they'll get comic accurate suits towards the end of the movie. Also she has short hair SMH.",1
"I love Aquaman because of how insane it is, and I like Wonder Woman for having a really nice visual aesthetic all the way through (until the CGI battle at the end). However, Shazam was lacking in the colour and aesthetic department for me, it was a little washed out at times and the monsters were so generic and boring, I liked seeing the whole family on screen though, that was really nice.  Also, don't get me wrong Schumacher's Batman films are not that good, but they don't even attempt to be serious, they're huge budget version of the 60s batman, and I can appreciate that in some way.",1
"It's probably because of the silent, submissive Asian woman stereotype and they don't want that.",3
"Right, the only assassination involved with Cassie should be her assassinating some dude after her parents assassinate her childhood.",3
Lmfao! Who wrote this crapfest?,1
I hope not. I was hoping Helena would have her traditional mafia backstory so that she'd have ties to whatever world we're going to get exposure to in Batman (since >!it's confirmed that John Turturro is gonna be playing Carmine Falcone!<).,0
Cassandra Cain speaking is enough to raise doubts.,2

"You don't feel that you could look at any movie prior to release and it couldn't ""go either way?""  You have never seen a movie that looks amazing but turns out to be less than that? You have never ended up seeing a movie that didn't look great but were blown away by??  No, I think its VERY accurate. Any movie could go either way, in theory.  Its a more rare case to see a movie that's as amazing as the trailers, or better than.",0
"I've seen the trailer, read interviews with cast and crew, and general reports on the film's production - enough to see both characters have been changed a significant amount from the source material to the point that I don't like it.",2
"My concern is that whoever it's made for, it's going to attract the same demographic as Charlie's Angels.",2
"Yeah, Green Lantern Corps is the DC movie I'm most excited for by a landslide but I do get a kick out of somebody on reddit deciding ""we don't want this ensemble of women, we want two other white men.""  The reason nobody's excited about this is that it doesn't look very good. It has nothing to do with who the heroes they chose are, nobody had a problem with Shazam coming out before they got to Flash.",2
"I like her, but I think she should distance herself from Harley. It‚Äôs just not a great universe right now and not a super healthy character. She‚Äôs more talented than this.",1
"Cheesy af, no exciting detail than Cheetah existing on script that too not sure about actor. In BoP we have BC, Harley, Black Mask. Also invisible jet is nothing exciting, I hope the stellar cast (Gal, Pedro, Pine) redeems it, with that Golden Armour. Also turned off by their decision to ""distance"" themselves using ""80's"". Plus romance taking center of tone I don't know, okay I guess?",0
"Well she is now. Poison Ivy, Katana, and Catwoman were members at one point. She was bound to join. Every female hero, antihero will join BoP.",1
I on board with that too but they are using the Birds of Prey so that was my fix.   But a solo film for both squads and then an epic crossover between the two that'd make bank and do a lot for the female representation.,1
nothing about this looks like a run of the mill chick flick lol but ok,0
"Huh, cool. I am looking forward to this movie, albeit cautiously optimistic.",1
"It's not the accent itself, it's the pitch and nasal inflection of it.  So high and squeaky sounding to me.  I've spent a fair amount of time in NY and seldom come across a voice like that.  Closest imo is Janice from Friends.",1
"LOL Don't underestimate Sonic too!   But personally, while I'm happy with the redesign, that movie still looks shit to me.",2
Damn right ‚úäüèΩ,1
Im not a hater. Calm down they‚Äôre just movies.,1
"If her action scenes are cool I don't care how she dresses, and I prefer that and not the sexy costume she wears in 90% of the comics",1
"From everything they‚Äôve released so far? It *could* end up being good, but the trailer was a mess, the casting looks horrible, and the promo stuff looks even worse. I‚Äôm a DC fan, and if I didn‚Äôt know who the cast was supposed to be I couldn‚Äôt tell you who was in this movie besides Harley. It looks like a group of random club chicks and their hip ‚Äúaunt‚Äù who tries desperately to relate and pretend she isn‚Äôt pushing 50. Meanwhile, they seem to be trying their hardest to make Harley their version of Deadpool. It just isn‚Äôt working for me on any level so far.",3
They don‚Äôt. Literally all we‚Äôve heard about these movie (and it isn‚Äôt much) is that it‚Äôs great. Only the trailer and promotional images and concept has made fans weary,2
"No, no, no, no you got it wrong. I said that Marvel fans never let anyone shit on their movies and we as DC fans always complain and say movies will flop. I remember comments when Jaquin Phoneix Joker make up was revealed. People said movie will flop, that it will be terrible and at the end it was masterpiece. We only saw 3 minute trailer and if you don't like it's OK. Margot really tries and loves to play Harley even though Suicide squad floped. Just look how she enjoyed in Comic con and she still wants to play Harley. This is why I am giving this movie chance, I always respect determination and hard work. About comics I read them but only Batman, Injustice and Flash.",1
"Bruce Wayne is not Batman, he's too busy being a celebraty",1
> Plenty of people know Jurnee.   From what? Shes not exactly a big star and hasnt been in much that a lot of people saw. I recognized her name from FNL but that was a long time ago and she wasnt the lead.  > Judging someone for something someone else did is pretty idiotic.  Do you really think people wouldnt hear her last name and have a negative association? Whether you think they should or not is different than if they would since you're discussing marketing.,2
"I have nothing againts Jurnee and I like movies having new talent but she's not popular at all, she's a little known in USA because of her brother and outside the USA nothing",0
Then they should had used a different character. Thats changing all of Cassandras character.,3
"Then why the fuck use Cass and not literally anyone else!? This isn't a visual thing like Babs being a red head, or having a comic accurate costume. This is one of Cassandra's defining character traits and so intertwined with with that means for her character. It's like they wanted a cameo/name drop so they can say theu have Cassandra and attract her fans and then completely ruin her.",3
"Cassandra Cain may be silent, but she's far from the submissive stereotype.",3
"Sheer and utter bs. If they wanna get political in a damn comic book movie, then they might as well participate in actual politics at the Senate.",0
"Beautifully said. Honestly, if they wanted a generic girl for Harley to save they didn't have to name her Cassandra Cain. They could have just made up an original character to be Harley's sidekick.",3
I am always negative too whenever I hear that something is not comicbook-accurate. But it might make sense in the film. Let's see how this pan out.,1
"Yeah, me too. I would prefer it if all Gotham heroes/heroines are in the same world as Batman and have some interaction in the future.",1
The empty theater demographic?,2
I‚Äôm pretty sure WB is saying their money is just as green as the Joker crowds money.,0
"Exactly. I would LOVE to see a good movie about Huntress, Black Canary, Batgirl (any iteration), and Harley Quinn. This just doesn't look good...",2
there do seem to be a lot of rumors that Jenkins is leaning into the cheesy pretty hard. Idk we'll see.,1
"The new BoP run that starts in 2020 is incorporating her, so yeah I know. I have all the BoP runs from the 90s up until this point.  Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against Harley at all. She's super dope. Its just a proper BoP movie is unlikely at this point since they are pulled into this one and introduced there too.",1
Her voice is pretty much standard native  Brooklyn : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HVzr_aOTYrI,1
The writing is atrocious and the plot is so damn overused. I almost wish they kept the old design because this movie would be iconically terrible and not just generic and forgettable.,1
"BloodShot comes out the same week as Sonic, it should be an interesting box office month for February",1
"babe, wasn't talking about you ;) there are legit haters out there",1
"It's not about sexy, it's about quality.",1
Harley is like the Poochie of the DCEU.  Hopefully she goes back to her home Planet soon too.,0
So it looks like a dumpster fire because you don't know what it is?,0
I guess I will take your word for it since I have no proof -.-,1
"Kind of like ""Deadpool"" in the X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie.",3
"""Silent, submissive"" type may not be the right one. She fits the asian character thats a ""Silent Badass"" like [The Female](https://the-boys.fandom.com/wiki/The_Female), [Snake Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_Eyes_(G.I._Joe)), and even Samurai Jack.",2
"Or just use Stephanie Brown.  No one would fucking care if you made Stephanie Brown Asian, I guarantee it. And ""streetwise urchin"" would totally mesh with her backstory.",3
"Yes, that was my point.",2
Heyoo!,2
"I mean, yeah, it is, but it's kind of a flop, which was my point.",1
"This is Brooklyn?  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3cSLofCLwS8  Maybe she got control of it over time, but the clip you linked is not the way she sounded in the 90's.  The clip here is from then.  Nails on a chalkboard.",1
"Wait, what? It looks like a dumpster fire because everything looks like shit. The characters, besides Harley, are unrecognizable (though Harley‚Äôs clothes look ridiculous too). The posters look like fan made low rent Deadpool ripoffs. The trailer was horrible. The marketing, whose job it is to get people excited for a movie, have failed on every level for me. If it works for you so far, great. It doesn‚Äôt for me. At all.",2
Oh i forgot in reddit you have to put s/ because people don't know when people are joking,1
"That's not a bad shout, I didn't even consider that. Anything would be better than what they're doing to Cassandra.",2
"Yeah but we're not talking about Captain America are we? That and Cap is not even a good example as he is a good guy 100% of the time and would be acceptable as a leader for the Avengers.  Harley on the other hand isn't a good gal 100% of the time and isn't acceptable as a leader for the Birds as that position is taken by Babs/Batgirl/Oracle of which needs no explanation whatsoever.  Nonetheless when the Birds are out on the field it's typically Black Canary that is making the decisions for the Birds. Black Canary was the head chairman for the Justice League and in this movie she takes a backseat to Harley Quinn, gtfouttahere.",1
"They seem pretty recognisable to me (and do you not know that Harley Quinn is meant to be ridiculous and has always worn a ridiculous costume?), the posters looked fine, and I don't know what was horrible about the trailer. You're just being hyperbolic here.",0
"No, I‚Äôm expressing my opinion here. You like it? Great. I think it‚Äôs all looked like shit. My wife is a DC fan and had no idea who anyone but Harley and Huntress (and that, barely) was supposed to be looking at the poster until I told her. And yes, Harley has always had ridiculous costumes, but this looks like a drag queen outfit as opposed to the kind of thing she generally wears in every other media representation she‚Äôs been in. I‚Äôm not a fan of it personally.",3
"Alright, let‚Äôs say that you have no idea that Black Canary is in this movie would you even guess that it is her based on the poster?",2
I assume you've read the title of the movie.,1
the black canary critique is something i actually sort of disagree with. I mean what exactly is she supposed to be wearing? In the comics she typically wears street clothes.,1
If you have no idea who Black Canary is how would you even know what she looks like? The same thing can be applied to any character lol. No one who didn't know Batman would be able guess that Batman in a Justice League poster is Batman.,0
"Because the whole point in marketing is to sell the movie. You put a bunch of superheroes people at least vaguely recognize on the poster, that‚Äôs fine. Put up a poster that looks like a sample size from a local night club and expect people to be excited, that‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs why you didn‚Äôt see Avengers or Justice League posters with the cast in casual clothes just standing around. Their job is to sell me on spending money to see the movie. I‚Äôm a huge comic fan. It doesn‚Äôt take much. They haven‚Äôt done that with what they‚Äôve shown so far.",2
"I never said that you did not know who Black Canary just that you don‚Äôt know that she was in this movie if you look at the the poster.  If you know who Batman is, you can immediately see that he is in Justice league",1
"First of all, this isn't a poster. Second of all, they aren't wearing casual clothes. And you say, it doesn't take much to get sold on a comic book movie but this tiny thing makes it look like a big piece of shit to you?",1
"Clearly you aren‚Äôt actually reading what I‚Äôm writing. I didn‚Äôt say just this. I said *everything they‚Äôve shown so far*. Everything. Nothing has worked for me. I can ignore posters etc. but the trailer was fucking horrible. Hell, so far Cassandra Cain is only that character in name only. She looks and acts like Stereotypical Teenage Girl #4. Again, note I say ‚Äúso far‚Äù. I only have what they‚Äôve shown to go on, and *so far* it looks horrible and I‚Äôm going to be saving my money.",1
"She's only said one line and in the whole trailer and I have no clue whats stereotypical about her. Even ""stereotypical"" teens don't dress like that. Also its a lot better than stereotypical mute Asian girl #40.  But sure, if all you care about is comic-book accuracy then don't watch the movie (because the movie itself isn't based on plot leaks) just like you probably didn't watch Joker.",0
"Are you DC‚Äôs publicist or something? Jeebus, you‚Äôre arguing over subjective bullshit just because you have a different opinion than mine. I don‚Äôt only care about comic accuracy. I just haven‚Äôt seen anything that makes me want to see the movie. It‚Äôs not my job to just blindly throw money at a movie because it has a comic book label stamped on it. It‚Äôs *their* job to make me want to. They haven‚Äôt.",1
"I thought Joker was a piece of shit so I can't be a DC publicist. And based on your comments, you do seem to care mostly about comic book accuracy.",1
"No, I don‚Äôt. The MCU movies are hardly comic book accurate, but I love them because they were still done well. They looked fun. They handled the changes well and made sense for the adaptation. Even for all the changes, it still looked and felt like The Avengers. This doesn‚Äôt look or feel like Birds of Prey at all. Most of the characters were all but unrecognizable. The trailer was generic and boring. The real question is, why do you care?",1
Okay this is epic üòé,2
I'd like to think it'll be darker and more slower paced to fit with the noir detective style. Both of Zimmer's bat themes are amazing but they fit a more action based Batman,2
"I really like what Hans Zimmer and JunkieXL did with the Batman theme in BvS. That dark, brooding feeling it creates.",2
"I dunno, as much as love the zimmer, I‚Äôd like to see battinson have something different sound wise",2
"I want it‚Äôs own thing,even though The BTAS theme is amazing,New themes are great too,like bale‚Äôs and batflecks,Batman theme,I don‚Äôt want it to be a copy,I want it to be a great theme for this version of the character.",1
"As cool as that is, I'd want to see something a little different.   Apparently when Reeves was writing the screenplay for The Batman, he was listening to [this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4jEymilyF0) from the Taxi Driver soundtrack. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more of that flavor in Michael Giacchino's score.",1
The animated series will forever be my favourite batman,2
Serious BTAS vibes,1
Definitely- with a very old film noir feel would be nice,3
"I sure as hell hope so. I loved the inner monologues from some of the early 2000s comic book movies like the Raimi Spider-Man films (hell, even the 2003 Daredevil movie had some solid lines) and there's no other comic book character that they fit perfectly with (besides Rorschach) than Batman.",3
I hope it‚Äôs not actually long Halloween.,2
"God yes, I hope that happens ü§û",2
"i do think its very possible with how much he talks about the noir tone and the whole ""point of view"" driven thing. And a lot of his favorite comics he mentioned have the inner monologues as well.",2
"Pretty sure it's not an ""adaptation"". It's an original story that's taking inspiration from a couple of things, most likely including TLH.",1
I wouldn‚Äôt mind. It can definitely work but I doubt it will happen.,1
I kinda hope not. I read it recently and didn't really care for it.,0
"Arrow's first three episodes had some pretty awesome inner monologues. Constantine's first few episodes, too.",1
"As someone who‚Äôs been following the movement since 2017, it‚Äôs so awesome to see it kinda blow up like this.",3
We trending. Over 1.1 million tweets with the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut hashtag last week.,3
Legend has it it's still climbing.,2
I wanna know what the numbers on the left stand for,1
"Not trying to be pessimistic or hate on the movement or anything, but did the recent push on Twitter do anything concrete besides getting all the actors to tweet out?",1
"After all this time, I still can‚Äôt wrap my head around the past few weeks. It hasn‚Äôt quite sunk in how big this has become, considering how small it been all along. Even Snyder acknowledging the campaign itself was a mindfuck, let alone all the traction it‚Äôs gained",3
I think it's percentage based on what has come before. Because it trended higher last week the 100‚Ä∞ has climbed. My god did it climb!,1
No didn't do a thing. And now the composer has come out and said it's not finished. So when mamoa said he seen it he seen just a rough cut of it.,0
"The SDCC and NYCC campaigns this year really helped get things rolling I'd say. There was very little Snyder Cut presence at 2018's Cons, and very little noise outside of Twitter in general.",2
Src?,1
It's on the front page for the sub here. Elfman said Zack never finished his movie because he had to leave production which is what was in line with what was said after release until Snyder kept releasing story boards and then mamoa said he see the cut so now everyone is calling Elfman a liar,0
"""I hope you appreciate, Kal-El, that everything that happens from this point is on your head. The skies will rain fire, the oceans will boil, the streets run red with the blood of billions. Only then, after your last pitiful hope is extinguished, will I end your life. Let's go.""",3
I really love Datrinti's work. Even more than Bosslogic's.,3
Looking forward to the snyder cut to see what he would've looked like. Although I doubt the glimpse of him is a lot.,1
"Im loving all of this, except for the chin, which makes him look a lot like Thanos",1
Could this look any more generic?,1
uhh nope,0
"‚ÄúIf you won‚Äôt be my knight, you will be my pawn‚Äù",3
Was that the quote from JLU?,3
I have spoken,1
Found it,1
Yh,2
**nominated\*\*\*\*** god damnit.,3
Alright let's go baby Joker bring some awards home.,3
So it begins,3
"Best blockbuster is finally a thing?  I have a feeling this is gonna be like Jethro Tull‚Äôs Metal Grammy, Once Upon a Time has that one in the bag.",2
"If Captain Marvel is in it, that waters down their credibility far too much for this to matter.",2
So Joaquin Phoenix wasn't nominated?,2
Best screenplay? If there‚Äôs one thing that isn‚Äôt good about Joker it‚Äôs the screenplay. It was severely lacking.,0
shazam is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Definitely the lowest point of the superhero movie craze.,0
"It‚Äôs under best blockbuster, basically a most popular category. It‚Äôs fine.",3
Yes JP is nominated,3
"I feel it plays it‚Äôs minimal part. Like a great drummer, at times .",0
> shazam is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.   ü§°ü§°ü§°,3
Shazam isn't even the worst CBM to come out this year. It's better than CM and Dark Phoenix (Even though the latter is a guilty pleasure).,3
You must not have seen Fantastic 4 or Suicide Squad,1
That's because the movie was meant to appeal to kids. Just show that movie to a kid and they will fall in love with it. My sister shouts SHAZAM each time she gets back from school.,1
I get how you feel. The movie had kiddy action. And it was goofy like BVS. But the movie is solid.,0
Ik. I was exaggerating,0
"Come on, the screenplay was completely barebones. The only reason the movie works is because of all the improv Phoenix does and how amazing an actor he is.",0
"I loved shazam but Dark Phoenix is so underrated, it'S not a bad movie.",0
"I haven‚Äôt seen CM but ill say Dark Phoenix isn‚Äôt nearly as bad as people say, the reshot final battle is one of the best superhero action scenes ive ever seen, the only problem is studio shortened runtime. It‚Äôs not a good movie to end a franchise but its a good x men movie.",0
You must not have seen Jessica Alba,1
Fan4stic's first like 40 mins were interesting and Suicide Squad is at least watchable,0
everything works together from script to cinematography to performance to score.,0
"It's not terrible (Better than CM by far). Just confused. It reminds me of Josstice League with the meddling, but not nearly as jarring. They at least made the reshoots flow better with the original stuff in DP. Josstice League has jarring inconsistencies just between film scenes and digital scenes.",0
"The biggest problem with Dark Phoenix is that Fox had no idea what to do. Kinberg wanted to make a giant two-movie epic that would begin a new era of X-Men. Then Fox saw bad reactions to all the other darker CBMs at the time and demanded one movie with a more triumphant tone. Then Fox decided it was too long and wanted Kinberg to make it under 2 hours. Then the Disney buyout happened and they threw a fit that it was so similar to CM (Even though Dark Phoenix had been in development longer). So then they reshot a ton of it. You can see the level of interest in the actors fluctuate wildly (Except for Lawrence, but she hasn't put in effort since DOFP).     Ultimately, I think what would've saved Dark Phoenix is if it had followed up a better movie. Yeah, I'm gonna rag on Apocalypse here, but with how that movie handled the Phoenix set-up and how DP basically ignored it, there was a lot that just went nowhere.     Thing is, I think that Apocalyspe could've been that Phoenix Sage Part 1 if they had focused it on that more, and Dark Phoenix as the Part 2 would've been received better.     It's one of those movies that I can see the potential. The script is good (Kinberg showed massive improvement from his X3 days), the cinematography is great, the finale actually being on Earth in a regular location was refreshing after so many space finales. It was definitely better than X3 and Apocalypse if you ask me. But at the same time, I can't ignore how Josstice League'd the movie got by Fox. Kinberg was so enthusiastic about making a dark epic (AKA exactly what the Phoenix/Dark Phoenix Saga was), and it saddens me that given the reception this film got that Kinberg may never direct another film in his life. There's a reason Claremont himself looked so positively on it, he saw underneath the rewrites that his story was still there.     All I can say is, if it exists somewhere in Fox's vaults, \#ReleaseTheKinbergCut",1
Do we have a script to know that?,1
"These things work together yes, which is why you have *a separate category for the picture as a whole*, and then you look at the individual elements to see if that deserves recognition as well in their respective categories, and in this case the script doesn‚Äôt. It is not uncommon to nominate a film for best picture but not for some of the other sub categories. People often get surprised to see best picture nominated movies that didn‚Äôt get all these sub category nominations, but the reason is that the sum can be greater than its parts. The separate nominations are for the parts.  It‚Äôs a good initial idea/pitch (joker origin as socio-realistic portrait of the derailment of a mentally ill person done like early Scorsese) but the script isn‚Äôt  really expanding this idea and doing interesting things with it, neither in dialogue, themes nor events happening in the movie. Only a few heavy handed references to ‚Äúrich vs poor‚Äù hint at what the movie could have done a lot of interesting things with if a proper script had fleshed these ideas out a little.  The best things in this movie is largely to Phoenix credit: an amazing acting performance, portrayal of a mentally ill man with mannerism.  The dancing sequences in the bathroom and on the stairs were improvised, - Neither Phillips not the script knew what to do when they were filming those scenes, and so Phoenix just started dancing. And the talk show with Murray largely was too.  I‚Äôm arguing if you didn‚Äôt have that performance you‚Äôd see how barebones the script really is. Phoenix is making the screenplay look better than it is. Beyond the amazing performance, the character of Arthur really isn‚Äôt written all that interesting. He‚Äôs not supposed to be funny, I get that, but then at least give him *some* other characteristic that makes him compelling other than his mental disability. I‚Äôd argue the dancing is probably more or less the only thing that makes you go ‚Äúhuh what is that about, that‚Äôs interesting‚Äù.  Ledger‚Äôs Joker isn‚Äôt all that *funny* either, yes he cracks some jokes here and there, but it‚Äôs really his world view, his philosophical outlook and desire to mess with the status quo, *whatever* that may be that makes him truly compelling - oh yeah, that and his complete unpredictability. All of *that* comes from the script, which of course also was brought to life by a stellar performance.  Imagine if the talk show scene actually had *good* dialogue, what you could do with DeNiro and Phoenix building on that, but instead you get an interview that doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere but a heavy handed ‚Äújoke‚Äù that serves you the one and only theme of the movie on a silver platter.  Again I‚Äôm not taking anything away from Phoenix and his performance, because that‚Äôs really what makes this movie. But just imagine what could have been with an actually good script. Phoenix was great, the production design was great, the makeup was great. I‚Äôd have loved to see that with good dialogue and subtext.",1
"Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Sadly, I know there is no way we‚Äôll ever see it now that Disney has a say in it :( I know some form of a cut exists somewhere though.",0
you can download the script from WB official site cant find it now,0
"If only you knew wtf you are talking about,you just throw random nonsense,its ok if you hated the movie but most of us didn't,its pretty obvious you just wanna hate the movie.If only you could take time and [read](https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/uploads/scripts/joker-2019.pdf) the script that's available from WB.",1
How is this news we knew this a year ago,3
What's there to confirm? He's said that pretty much since he started working on Joker.,3
"This is not news. Plus, you just linked to Batman-news. That idiot doesn‚Äôt break news. He recycles old news very late after the fact to get hits to his site.",3
We know. This was during the development process not post-Joker.,1
"Darn, I thought this was was going to have new information.",1
I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and confirm this too.,1
he said that on tiff or venice,1
Deadshot by Michael Mann  Deathstroke by Gareth Evans  The Question by David Fincher   Let's goooooooooooo!!!!,1
That site use to be good when Chris ran it. Not so much anymore,2
I actually didn‚Äôt like Chris. He always tried to stir up shit in the DC fandom.,2
I stopped following it the day Chris left,1
"Same, its shit now. So is Superhero News",1
2009 felt like the ideal version of what they are vs what they actually are.,3
"I love it.  Watchmen is so good.  The comic, the movie, the show.. all of it.",3
I love how the film and the series both make great use of their respective mediums to deliver on the graphic novel's legacy. *Watchmen* the film contains some of my all-time favorite sequences of any CBM (adapted or otherwise) while *Watchmen* the series has been showing everyone the fertile ground that lies between our reality and the alternate history that Alan Moore conceived so many years ago.,3
"Episode 6 was everything I was hoping the TV show could lead to. I love the movie, but not having to be constrained to just the original story opens up so much. There‚Äôs still 3 episodes to go, but Lindelof and team are knocking this out of the park so far.",3
"Micheal Wilkinson is the greatest costume designer. I hope he gets nominated and wins for Disney's Aladdin, because he hasn't won for any film yet (he was nominated for American Hustle).   The HBO show's costume designer is Meghan Kasperlik -- she was assistant costume designer to Michael Wilkinson on a few projects (American Hustle, Joy, Noah), who she described as a prime ""mentor and an amazing teacher"".",3
This was an impeccable hour of tv,2

"I just had to come back and gush about how Hooded Justice‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù origin has parallels to Superman‚Äôs, not to mention a few episodes back there was that childless farmer and wife with a mysterious burning object in the sky, and how Angela‚Äôs last name is most definitely a reference to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abar,_the_First_Black_Superman",2
"I haven't watched this show yet, but is it related to the movie or is it its own thing?",1
The shows version of Ozymandias‚Äô costume is WAY better than the movie version,2
Is that Jeffrey Dean Morgan as comedian in coloured pic?,1
"I'll admit, the film version looks much better conpared to the HBO version, but I think that's the point. The HBO version feels more gritty, depressing, and realistic, since these are normal people creating their own costumes. The film version is extremely faithful and vibrant with colors, but almost feels too perfect and well-designed. All in all, I think both the movie and the show did a fine job capturing the image and essence of the Minuteman, the film aesthetic-wise and the show tone-wise.",1

I did enjoy watching Hooded Justice boof Captain Metropolis up his poop chute in last week‚Äôs episode.    Hot! üî•üî•üî•üî•üî• üî•,0
HJ in the show looks like a wimp compared to the 2009 version IMO haha,0
It does fit with Sally's weird sense of nostalgia for those times.,2
So cool that there's a connection! I was noting the similarities between these costumes as well as the differences.,2
"The track for the Tulsa Massacre and immediate aftermath is called ""Orphans from Krypton.""",2
"The show mostly has its own plot and set of characters but there are different viewpoints, connections, references to the events in the original comic, not the movie adaptation. You can watch the movie though coz it was mostly faithful to the comic plot wise except for the ending. As long as you know that the ending was different between the comic and movie, you'll be fine. The comic ending is heavily referenced in the show.",1
It's a sequel to the comic set 34 years later.,1
"It's not related to the movie.  It's a continuation of the comic story like 30 years later.   And yes, some things will confuse you if you've only seen the movie and not readed the comic.  But, it's a great show.",1
Doesn't the movie version have nipples?,1
"Yep -- which is a little weird, because in the comic at this point he's supposed to be 17, 20 at the very latest.",1
"They both look great, IMO. The HBO version has more of a depressing period vibe.",3
Joel Schumacher approves.,1
The Dark Knight transitions right into Batman & Robin. Wow.,3
Wonder woman on a batman week?,3
Tuesday lit af,3
I cant imagine watching movies on regular cable tv in 2019 lol,2
They have Wonder Woman and Suicide Squad but not Justice League? That's really odd,2
Wish they could show the UE of BvS.,3
I'm really confused by reverse order of burton/Schumacher on Saturday. Lol,2
Hell yeah i get to watch Batman and Robin twice in the same week,2
Double Suicide Squad? I pity the fool who's gonna face this challenge.,1
Am I the only one who finds this a bit funny?,1
Who did the order for Saturday?,1
 Who ordered this?,0
For that Wayne Truck cameo.,3
Wonderbat shipping is real,3
It's newer so they probably don't have the rights to it yet,2
"who cares,its cool",2
And the letter from Bruce.,3
They also may not want the rights... haha,1
So you watch them in that order than?,0
If you're going to have batman and robin and BvS on there I'm sure they don't care,1
"no, but most people dont watch tv in real time nowadays. but i can dvr all the batman movies and watch them whenever i want",1
whats wrong with you,0
Well I can submit to that!,1

" **Oceans 8** definitely did decent numbers and the best among those 3 and best one there ,The thing is if it's good it can do great as long as they promote it better +they got harley",3
Ask yourself the difference between birds of prey and all those movies you just listed,3
"Because that one scene in endgame helped it being the highest grossing movie /s  But I do think Harley Quinn + Robbie has that kind of power to bring in the audiences and everything that has come out even through ViewerAnon, is that is a wild very enjoyable movie. I am hopeful for its box office prospects.",3
Because Harley Quinn,2
"Ocean's 8 was a hit. So was Hustlers a few months ago. Or Girls Trip. Or the original Charlie's Angels for that matter.   If the film is good, it'll be a hit, girl gang or not. Any genre has both hits and flops.",2
"None of those are new, in fact Hustlers did well because it isn't just a spinoff of something else. Birds will have more draw for its much latger appeal to the i.p.   Just remembered cxcp December might get trailer 2. Excited.",1
"It's not necessarily that girl gang movies don't work. It's the story and tone of the movie.  'Go woke, go broke' is underlying point here. If BoP was about the characters, had a great story and not 'gIrL P0wEr!!!' It should have a reasonable chance of being successful.  I really think it can, so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. *fingers crossed*",2
Ghostbusters demise was its budget not its revenue. And Ocean 8 was a smash hit what are you talking about? And that‚Äôs not even accounting for other success stories like Bridesmaid or Girls Trip. Hell even the first 2 Charlie‚Äôs Angels were smash hits. Please do some research before posting.,3
Ocean‚Äôs 8 did alright with $300m against &70m budget. Why do you want BoP to fail?,2

"False premise, bad examples. Try again?",2
I feel like you thought this post was a lot smarter than it actually is.,1
"Any movie can work if it actually looks good. The movies you just listed were genuinely awful and didn‚Äôt bring much of anything new to the table. As for BoP, I think having that John Wick dude coming in to oversee the fight scenes will appeal to a lot of people. Not to mention it‚Äôs a known comic book movie so it already has an insane advantage.",1
Get to know the box office more before you make a thread like this,1
"Difference will be that it is a CBm with a built in fanbase.  As long as their marketing doesn't lead to outward hate toward their very own audience like many other films, it will do great as long as it's great.  Maybe even if it is bad.",1
It won‚Äôt,1
Notice how female led films are viewed more harshly. Just ask John Campea. Bridesmaids was great. So was Ocean's Eight. There are plenty of bad guy gang films as there are good ones. Same applies to every genre film.,0
It‚Äôs because birds of prey is an original story with interesting characters. It‚Äôs not a worse remake or unwanted retelling of a classic franchise. ‚ÄòWoke‚Äô movies can be good. Wonder Woman did it right. Wasn‚Äôt overbearing but she is empowered above man as a god and still had faults,2

Nah Henry Cavill is my Superman! I did see an idea for Winston Duke to play the loveable dorky Superman and it'd focus on a lot of him and Lois working the Daily Bugle and fighting crimes together and I love the idea! Winston Duke would be awesome!,2
He's just not a great actor tbh,1
Michael B. Jordan would be a great nothing. There's a million other guys out there who could play Superman or Steel out there. Stop hyping up this guy.,2
"Michael B Jordan is ridiculously talented, especially Fruitvale Station and Creed. I support this.",2
It's one of those things where superhero movies set in the future seems like too big of a stretch for audiences to enjoy but then you have to remember the most popular of the recent x men movies was Days of Future Past.,1
What's with all the posts recently wanting to cast him of all people?,1
Waste of talent.,1
I would love to see John Henry Irons show up on the big screen. I have loved the character since the Reign of the Supermen and he has not been given enough spotlight. Jordan would kill at it and it would be really cool to see Superman through the eyes of a person he inspired to take up the S and be a hero.,1
"I believe MBJ is one of the best actors working today! However!, I believe he has played enough superheroes. F4, BP, and Chronicle. Give some one else a shot... or ya know... KEEP HENRY",0
No thanks. This guy is average af.,0
Michael B Jordan would be good as the side character that shouldn't say anything. I think he is so overrated.,0
"I really dont thonk he is that great of an actor. I dont know why everyone loves him. He just has that same smug arrogant face on every role he does. Super punchable face haha. Like you said, Keep Henry.",1
Those fans couldn't make BvS a billion dollar movie. WB isn't afraid.,3
It's more that they don't care about the snyder cut or the fans who support it and want to move on to making more movies under this leadership.,3
"No offense but Snyder fans need to realise that they are an incredibly small portion of the overall audience, an audience that clearly didn't take to Snyder's vision of the DCEU which cost WB hundreds of millions of dollars and they have been trying to distance the movies from it ever since.     The question isn't what are WB afraid of, the question is why would they want to spend time and resources on something they are trying to move on from when they are focusing on a future that has nothing to do with Snyder?",3
How do we know the SC was even good tho? Whenever Zack releases pictures online I always get a BvS flashback. There is watch too much going on in his films. It may have fan service but is it well executed?,3
" I‚Äôm glad you talking about this, that‚Äôs the point why some people are against JL SC.  I know it exist in some degree, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea for WB/DC to waste their resource and release it while DC is still in recovery from bad reputation from MoS, BvS, Suicide Squad and JL. Not to mention this would lead to more demand from Snyder fans.",2
I think WB will have a hard time on social media for a long time if they won't do anything.,1
Very valid point. But that's the bed they made and they have to deal with the repercussions of trying to switch sheets on us without anyone noticing.,0
Exactly. Aquaman and Joker were hits because mainsteam moviegoers loved them.   General audiences don't care about JL tbh.,1
"Well the new fans couldn't get Shazam to a 400million but the Snyder fans got AQ to 1 billion, along with the rest of the world. Also a movie doesnt need to reach one billion to be successful. That's just flawed logic. Profit is a profit",0
Movies that alot of people don't really care for. Except for a few.,0
If you didn't like BvS you will not like the Snyder Cut. I can already tell you this now. The people calling for its release liked BvS.,1
Hard time? They're doing great without it.   They'll be perfectly fine.,1
>deal with the repercussions  I wouldn't use the word repercussion to describe having more critically successful and financially profitable  movies post Snyder,3
"The repercussions is successes.   JL is one of the worst movies ever made. And the more people talk about the recut, the more that line will be repeated.   ""Wants fans a recut because the original is so bad even they can't watch it"". Sadly, you will still be talking about that 5 years from now.",1
"> Snyder fans got AQ to 1 billion  Did they make James Wan's Furious 7, Saw franchise, and Conjuring Universe billion dollar properties too?",3
I wonder how you're breaking down these numbers exactly when saying Snyder fans got Aquaman to a billion?,3
">Well the new fans couldn't get Shazam to a 400million  Well, the ""new fans"" secure a sequel to Shazam! and its spin off in Black Adam. A film is successful when it makes enough money but more importantly when the general audience wants to see more about it.",3
>Well the new fans couldn't get Shazam to a 400million  They got it to be more profitable than Man of Steel and BvS so ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Also lol at Snyder fans got Aquaman to the billion. The same fans that let BvS have a historical second weekend drop?,3
"Well Shazam will have his own mini universe, snyder for the other hand big fat nothing!",2
">the new fans couldn't get Shazam to a 400million but the Snyder fans got AQ to 1 billion,  Wut ? That's straight up dumb",1
"Snyder fans didn't get Aquaman to $1 Billion. If that's the case then why  did JL, which has Aquaman and eveyrone on it make almost just half of it at the boxoffice?",1
>Movies that alot of people don't really care for. Except for a few.  I.E. The Snyder Cut of Justice League outside the hardcore fan bubble....,3
"They do, that's why they're getting sequels. We think of the future.  While JL fans, sorry to say, will be stuck in the past and, sadly will never get a recut.",1
Aquaman was critically mixed. Joker will only give WB 50 percent of the profits and is critically mixed. WW was critically acclaimed but couldn't beat BvS. Shazam was critically acclaimed but barely made 340mil.,0
Nothing you said made sense.,1
"I love Wan , truly I do , but Fast and Furious we‚Äôre making a shitload of money before him and after him , First Saw was awesome but as far as I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs the only one he was involved in (Producer /Director ) and Conjuring is definitely all him and those movies are awesome so credit where credit is do.",1
"The highest grossing film in both the saw and conjuring franchises is at like $300M lol, the way you worded it makes it sound like both Of those franchises have billion dollar entries",0
"I didn't say they were the only ones, I said they were a good chunk as well as GA members. That a because the people that had been following the series wanted to see more of these characters AS WELL AS the new fans they were pulling in.",0
"Well I'm breaking the fact that movie did in fact make a billion dollars and the fact that plenty of people saw it clearly, plenty of those were different types of fans, some new and old, and definitely ones that were fans of Snyder as Momoa was cast during Snyders run.",0
But who is really taking about Shazam right now after its success? No one. They even said they fast tracked a sequel to keep the kids young.,0
Shazam is part of the Snyder universe but good ahead. Keep being bitter buddy haha. And he probably has more going on then you do buddy haha.,0
Hahaha nice try.,0
"Whose we? I'm thinking of the future too and it's very uncertain with DCs future. I mean, no Justice League is a silly idea.",1
WW was more profitable than BvS. Joker is more profitable than BvS and MOS combined. The 50 percent argument doesn‚Äôt even make sense considering they worked with multiple production companies on all the DCEU movies.,2
">Aquaman was critically mixed.  Fits what I said of being more critically successful than Snyder DCEU films.  >Joker will only give WB 50 percent of the profits and is critically mixed.  Again, fits what I said as they cofinance all DC films so it becomes an irrelevant factor when used to compare profits. And also still more critically successful.  >WW was critically acclaimed but couldn't beat BvS.  Again, fits my description. WW made more profit than BvS or MoS.  >Shazam was critically acclaimed  Fits the description of being more critically successful.  I actually didn't need you to provide examples that fit my statement  but you did, so thanks. It's even funnier because you thought you were disproving me.",2
You do understand that WB's splits the profits on all of the DC movies they make right? They split BVS with Ratpac 50/50. You're  embarrassing yourself mate.,3
WW and even SS were more profitable than BvS though despite BvS making more at the Box office.,3
"Mixed is Man of Steel, Aquaman wasn‚Äôt critically mixed don‚Äôt rewrite history to fit your narrative. also every single DC movie has been co financed so I really don‚Äôt get the obsession y‚Äôall have with pointing it out that Joker was.  Shazam which made $374M is more profitable than BVS and Man of Steel, You‚Äôre not making the up point you think you‚Äôre making.",2
All those movie still made a profit and the GA likes them compare to BVS,2
"Wonder Woman made $253m in profit compared to BvS' $106m, per [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2018/03/wonder-woman-box-office-profit-2017-1202351443/).",2
"Well the reason why you want a recut is because you don't like what you saw in JL.  The audience agrees. Meaning, the more you ask for a recut, the more audiences is reminded how pretty much everyone hates the movie.",1
Do you actually believe the things you are writing? Get your shit together.,1
I do not care about the social media trending. As a DC fan I only care about the actual films.  Whether they are getting sequels/spin offs and whether the DC universe has a future.  Which I think it has.,2
> Get your head out of your ass before you starting making up lies.  BVS having an all-time historical second weekend drop isn't a lie......,2
JSA in Black Adam and of course WW84 will retckon mos and bvs. Bitter? no unlike you i am true dc fan no snyder cheerleader.,2
Most of the GA has moved on from Justice League and are much more looking forward to a DC Films without Zack Snyder. When Todd Phillips was able to make a $1 billion DC film before Zack Snyder.....,3
"We, who like the new direction WB is taking.  There are two DC camps, new direction, and the old direction. They are mutually exclusive.  We choose the new one.",1
Sorry it doesnt make sense for you but that's how it went.,0
Roasted xd,1
You're embarrassing yourself. The profit sharing is adjusted for every film. That's why it was a big deal with Joker because they had no faith in that film.,0
I am not rewriting history. Dont be ignorant to history. Man of Steel was mixed to mostly positive just like Aquaman. The louder minority of people detracted from the overall success it made. Every single movie has been cofinanced but not that extreme for the most part. So they are not getting the biggest bang for their buck. Shazam barely beat its budget. Mos and Bvs made its budget back.,0
"Bvs made a profit too. Also I have hears more people make fun of Aquaman the movie more than BvS. The movie was extremely mixed but was still successful. Same with BvS. Aquaman was the 6th in the series of DCEU movies, so that's what led it to being a bigger boom.",1
"[And according to this Suicide Squad made 158M for WB.](https://deadline.com/2017/03/suicide-squad-box-office-profit-2016-1202052792/)   So yeah u/TruthAndJusticeUSA, they were both more profitable than BvS",2
Deadline is inaccurate many times.,1
"It's not a recut. It's the director's cut. The actual movie. The theatrical cut was the recut since he reshot and recur everything to be a whole different, watered down, shorter movie.",1
I wasnt talking about social media. And it has an uncertain future but yes it has a future.,0
"Maybe not but everything else was. Plus, the home media and DVD says have been enormous for BvS and MoS. Both AQ and WW barely scratch the surface of profit on the home media department, which is a big market btw. Over 100 million dollars in sheer profit for MoS alone.",0
"I am a true DC too. And way to insult me for being a fan of a director, not cool. However, even if he wasn't or was involved, I would still be pissee at this current course of action that DC is taking either their slate of movies. WW84 is sounding like it will be Superman 4 like and will probably retcon itself. Seems like it's already going to retcon it's own first movie which is absolutely stupid.",0
"Well JL really wasnt a Snyder film. If it was his film that was released, we would be having a different conversation one way or another. And by your logic they wouldn't be excites about him involved afterwards, so you need to have that Snyder Bias take a long walk home. And besides the 1 billion isn't even going to WB all the way since they are only getting 50 percent of it.",0
You can't say I'm not part of that camp. You do not dictate what I am or am not apart of. That is trying to be the thought police. I even said that there are few ones o am looking forward to them. Just not all of them or alot of them. And you dont speak for everyone. Get over yourself.,1
"Yeah, that‚Äôs how it went for all the movies. So you‚Äôre not adding anything to your argument.",2
Stop living in your Dreamworld WW made around 250m in profit   ( src -> https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-movie-profits-warner-bros/amp/ )  On the other hand BVS slightly edged Ant-Man with 107m   (src->https://deadline.com/2017/03/batman-v-superman-box-office-profit-2016-1202049201/amp/),1
"Brother even with half profit Joker brought more than MOS and BVS in their respective theatrical runs COMBINED. Joker a low budget movie brought more money than the trinity. There‚Äôs no twisting the facts . If Shazam barley beat it budget then MoS and BVS are flop because again that lil movie made more than those two.   It‚Äôs simple,  Snyder couldn‚Äôt deliver a homerun DC movie for 7 years between Watchemen MoS and BvS. And a right after he got the boot WB delivered 2  widely embraced billion dollar films in less than year.  Look It‚Äôs fine to support the man and stand for his arts but don‚Äôt come here and be delusional and disrespectful to the filmmakers who actually did what he couldn‚Äôt do deliver smash hit DC movies.",3
I am not saying that BVS is a bad movie but let's not down play the success of other movies. DCEU is doing fine post synder,2
Deadline is very inaccurate.,0
"I'm curious where you're getting your ""factual evidence"" from then.",2
"But you‚Äôre the one who came here talking about box office stats, you‚Äôre the one who came up all aggressive just because Op made a accurate statement. DC movies are literally stronger than they  ever been. So talking about repercussions is nonsensical at This point. Why does  it hurts you so much to admit it?",2
"> Well JL really wasnt a Snyder film.  Well BVS was, for better or worse, a Snyder film and couldn't even pass $900 million.......",3
No I am.,0
"I am not being disrespectful to those creators. I was just pointing out the facts of the situation an replying to someone's comment. I by no means was insulting their work. And you need to stop taking by referring to other movies besides his as smash hits when they all have been hits in their own way, minus JL and kind of Shazam. Stop being a fool and take your Snyder bias home. Plus the theatrical cut of BvS was edited poorly so that led to a different movie then what people should've gotten and would've been differently received.",0
I'm not downplaying the success of the others I'm just refuting those claims and using factual evidence of the situation.,0
"Nah, you are you just delusional. Deadline is more reputable than your petty ass will ever be.",2
Well not just one source like everyone else likes to do. ;),0
Nope. No sheer sense of direction.  Only short sighted plans and profit. No longer term gains.,0
Still a profit and was only the second movie on the series. Beat all the phase one marvel movies except the Avengers. All about progression and build up.,0
Lol what a great argument.,2
"Justice League is one of the worst movies ever made, and had a massive budget. Sorry, but i'm just telling the truth.   It is so bad that even its own fans don't want to watch it anymore and are now reduced to praying for a recut.",1
"I don‚Äôt have a Snyder bias,  Dawn do the dead is one of my favorite Saturday night in movie and MoS is a good movies as well.   But there‚Äôs a spectrum my friend; it‚Äôs not you either adore that director and everything he does or you‚Äôre hate him and everything he does. As much I like some of his choices I realize that his model was not sustainable.  You just can‚Äôt have a Trinity movie being a laughing stock and dropping 65% on it second weekend (even more worldwide). A movie that opens at $420M shouldn‚Äôt be a  ‚Äúhit in its own way‚Äù it should be one the biggest movie of its time.   My loyalty is to these character,  they deserve  the glory and prestige they had in the golden age of the comics. I‚Äôm not gonna  be a yes man to a director just because I‚Äôm a fan of his. Especially when his track record is problematic.",2
Yes but most of the movies you mention were more profitable than BVS which is why I said WB is doing fine. I want to see the synder cut but it is not imo what WB should put as a priority,1
Not petty. Just stating fact. Sorry you are upset about it. Deadline gets plenty of things wrong still.,0
"Lol, Batman and Superman are more popular characters than any Avengers character but the crossover made just 850 mil with over half that made in its opening weekend. BvS didn't even make as much as TDK which was also the second film in that franchise. And TDK didn't have 3D and fully grown Asian markets like BvS did. But please keep sucking off Snyder like you always have. Isn't that why you made this alternate account?",3
"Because the director's cut was never released and had been totally ruined. If it had been left alone we wouldve had a different result,,good or bad. The budget only went higher than it should've because of the amount of money that went into the ""minimal"" amount of reshoots.  I don't doubt that JL theatrical cut is bad but that's the whole point of the Snyder cut Campaign. To get the actual movie that JL fans, not just Snyder fans, want. Look beyond the Snyder aspect and look at what we all got robbed of.",1
"Your mindset is problematic. Plus when you overuse the historical drop and dont look at the bigger profit and the long game instead of just using the party line. And no one is treating rhe characters he was using with respect anymore.  We have fucking Pattinson as Batman man which is a disgrace, and it's going to be a rehash of the younger years which NO ONE wants to see anymore. We get it . We know Batman has an origin or eselt years. Give us the experienced Batman. Stop building him up all the time. Just have him be Batman. Superman has been sidelined for now. Flash has been delayed mostly due to studio problems as well as Ezra being super busy. Harley Quinn is getting overused. Wonder Woman 84 sounds like its going to be Superman 4 quality and no Justice League. Sounds like the characters that you are loyal to aren't getting the justice they deserve. What about Nightwing or Deathstroke, they had directors and everything? Nope, let's do s Joker film for some reason. Batman vs Deathroke on an Arkham Style? Nope let's just rehash the early years again to try and recreate Nolan 2.0. Green Lantern is MIA.  All these we were going to get and we wouldve gotten becusee Justice League was going to open the doors but WB was too shortsighted to see the profit they would gained from the franchises they could've made that he was opening up. Foolish to the highest degree.",0
"No it kind of is because it helped with world building. World building opens up new franchises, new franchises means more actors, directors and other talent which then creates more opportunities for profit. And then you spiderweb from there. Now it's a bunch of seesawing projects that have no really sense of cohesion or focus which will only create shortsighted results. They are not brand building. Just profit building with initial burst and current successes. They are looking at the endgame profit of it. When you build a brand big enough.",0
"Plus, none of those movies have made massive profits on the home media sales, which is more important then ever nowadays. Especially with streaming being such a big deal. All of Snyders movies make absolute profit with that too. So overall the success of BvS is strong and longterm. Not short bursts and a ""critical darling"" that will be forgotten in a few months.",0
No they dont. You just mad.,2
"Post Mortem success from Hearh Ledger. Movie wouldn't have made as much if that hadn't happened. I'm not sucking off Snyder, keeping living in your small minded world dude.",0
Not really. That movie is a mess and no recut will fix it. The entire premise of the movie is dumb. MoS went from suddenly fighitng Batman to everyone fighting in JL. You can't fix that without pretty much erasing the first two movies which exists.  What they need to do is do a MoS sequel so we can loop BvS and JL out of the narrative.,1
"> I am not being disrespectful to those creators.  >We have fucking Pattinson as Batman man which is a disgrace  Your inconsistency is amazing. And no, MOS and BVS were not that profitable in the grand scheme. If they were, Snyder's vision wouldn't have been abandoned.",2
"Unfortunately, Justice League is one of the most bloated and hated movies ever made. it cost so much, and destroyed the legacy of Justice League. Batman v Superman is equally bad, one of the worst comic book movies ever made.   As long as we talk about this recut, this line will be repeated over and over in the media.   ""Justice League fans want a recut because the film was so bad they want to forget about it. """,1
"Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Shazam, Suicide Squad, and Joker will make more profit than BvS. Even taking home video into account, according to Deadline, BvS only made 100 mil in profit. Aquaman and Wonder Woman are close to 300 mil, Suicide Squad around 150 mil, and Joker will likely end up with 500 mil in profits. Again, these are all Deadline's numbers which is a reputable source.  So you are wrong at every turn.",2
Yes they do. No news source is infallible. They all make wrong reports. Even the good ones. You're just mad because you know I am right.,1
> Post Mortem success from Hearh Ledger.  OK and The Dark Knight Rises? That made even more than the first Batman and Superman crossover film....,2
"Lol, that isn't why TDK made a billion. Sure, it helped a bit but the death of an actor doesn't mean a movie will make 5 times the previous one. BvS almost certainly should have made a billion with that WW opening weekend (like every other movie in that range). It just ended up having terrible legs",2
"MoS still didnt even have Batman in it so I dont know what you're on haha. And yeah that's my opinion, I think BvS is a great film, doesn't mean I am wrong or right. Just my opinion. And clearly you weren't paying attention to anything. They weren't all fighting in JL. Look the theatrical cut was bad, but even a moron can tell the reason they were fighting Superman in that movie was because he was in an amnesiac state form being resurrected. That was like one of the few salvaged moments of Snyders version with a bunch Whedon scenes mixed in there.",1
"If they weren't successful he wouldn't have been given JL. However, exec change up during the time, like promoting Johns, interfered with his work and fired him as well as cut down his whole work. Keep in kind Empire strikes and a new hope were critically terrible at the time toom pretty harsh or mixed reviews.",0
"Batman vs Superman is great in my opinion, so that's where the opinions differ and no one is right in that aspect. The reason JL is so bad is because the theatrical cut isnt the movie we were promised. As fans of the JL we all were robbed of the story and world building that we were going to get with that movie. And dont be so melodramatic, the legacy of the Justice League isnt destroyed haha. People still love the comics, the animated movies and series and injustice which primarily features the justice league and the fact that people want the Snyder cut or just another JL movie shows that the legacy is not ruined. It just that the movie that was going to kickstart a lot of it was butchered.  As fans we all want it and not the watered down version we got. To see the beginnings of the League in their glory.  Its not a recut. It's the directors cut. The original intended film.",1
"That is grossly inaccurate. BvS is still one of the top selling DVDs out of all the ones you just made. Aquaman hasn't even made much in those sales. And nowadays the streaming and home media service is more important than every. Once again, deadline gets shit wrong and doesn't know much on actual gross or profits. They are just mouth pieces for other people. If you look at other sources, you know that I am right.  Sorry for pointing out how wrong you are.",0
"No, you aren't right. You will never be right in this argument. You have no sources that says that Deadline is wrong. Your argument is as delusional as yourself bud. But keep shouting ""fake news"".",2
3rd in the trilogy and hype of the whole series. Of course it was going to make more. They built a brand of the Nolan movies. Remember Batman Begins made shit for money.,0
"Haha I could list a dozen that prove you wrong and you could only provide the one that proved you right. So I guess you just have to settle with you petty little victory. However, deadline has been wrong before, you know that, or stleats should know that. Because if you believe that you are always right and that the news media has never made a mistake, then I have a massive newsflash for you:it does! Plenty of mistakes. Let me know when you're done drinking the Kool Aid.",1
"Wow with the amount of insults you just threw at me, I wont dignify this conversation anymore. Have a good one man. Stay bitter but do better.",1
But you have no evidence that Deadline got BvS's profits wrong and that they got the profits every other DCEU movie wrong. You have no sources mate.,2
Go ahead. Keep name calling me. It's great.,1
"Oh  you're asking for proof from the wrong guy. Hes delusional as fuck. Yesterday he cried about me insulting him and yet when I asked for proof of a single insult he sidetracked it about 10 times and told me to find it myself. Hes got no proof that deadline has the wrong numbers for this, hes just too stubborn to admit hes fucked up",1
You dont know that I dont have any evidence. You're just assuming that. I've been debating you this entire time.,1
Not it's not a fact. You're just insulting me now and calling me dumb for things that I am factually talking about but now you're coming across as the bigger jerk here. My argument's arent in bad faith. That's just your assumption. They are in good faith. Stay bitter but do better.,1
I'm assuming that because you haven't given me any and it's clear from your comments you don't even know how the boxoffice works.,1
Haha nice try. I clearly do know how it work. Clearly you don't and you totally underestimate home media sales too,0
"You don't man. If you did, you wouldn't be saying any of what you did about the boxoffice of the film. You clearly don't understand that BvS had terrible legs and should have made a billion with it's opening weekend. And you still haven't given me a single source.",1
"They's not gonna leave, accept it",3
I seriously can‚Äôt be the only one who has the gut feeling that Ezra is out,3
I‚Äôd rather the flash not look like a serial killer,3
"Ezra is Warner Bros' boy toy, he ain't going anywhere.",1
My choice is still Lucas Till.,1
"Yea, he does look like serial killer loll",1
Wally west,1
I have to see him before I have an opinion.,1
Jonathan Groff or bust,1
I'd rather take Ben Hardy (Physically not the accent) but Ezra is so in love with The Flash that he'll want to keep the part .. even if he has others priorities,0
(I put They because Ezra is non binary),2
"If he was, Daley and Goldstein would still be making this film.",3
From all the reports (I know they‚Äôre not 100% reliable) it seems like Ezra really was trying to be in this franchise. It‚Äôs just taking so long and he does have other projects to do,1
This guy looks pretty normal to me.,3
Then get Ezra out of there üòÇüòÇ,2
I can definitely see that HAHAHA!!,0
Get mental help. Seriously.,0
my thoughts exactly. WB seems to be keen on keeping Miller around and I like it. He's a great actor. And they seem to love Hudson since she's on Batgirl & The Flash as a result of her BoP script.,1
Did you mean to say *wouldn‚Äôt*?,0
For a serial killer.,3
Yeah he literally played one  That being said neither really give that vibe off to me,1
Non binary people are not a joke,2
"No? Daley and Goldstein are out, Ezra‚Äôs still in.",1
right!,1
My bad. I thought their involvement hinges on Ezra sticking with the role.,1
"God, I love Capullo's Batman artwork.",3
we had so many jokers in the last decade that i would like to take a small break and see what other villains have to offer.,3
"This would actually be really cool, especially if its not obvious at all",3
That would be cool. Sort of like in Batman Mask of the Phantasm how Joker was just a gangster who was part of Sal Valestra‚Äôs gang.,3
"Maybe Mr. J is a member of Falcone's goons and Batman is indirectly responsible for his origin?  And we see a fully formed Joker going against Batman in the 3rd movie?   With the numerous villains already existing in Matt Reeve's Batverse, I'm pretty sure Arkham Asylum will be teased.",3
"The only thing that could make this better is if the penciller somehow found a way to subtly make the words start getting more and more off model. Modern Joker dialogue looks less like letters and more like bugs on the page that happen to take the shape of letters. Here, it switches instantly from normal speech, to insane Joker speech in one panel.",3
"I know many people want a break from Joker and it‚Äôs easy to see why considering how many actors portrayed him in the last 10 years or so, but let‚Äôs be real:   If The Batman is as good as we want it to be, if the villains in that movie are perfect, we all know that we will ask to see his Joker. And quite frankly, a whole Batman trilogy without his greatest villain just doesn‚Äôt feel right.",3
What‚Äôs this from?,2
Obsolete word for what? I don‚Äôt read comics but this panel needs an end.,3
No. Though I liked Todd Phillips film. I really would like to see DC go back to giving us  Joker who comes out of nowhere and has no clear origin story.  I think the Joker is robbed of much of his power when you know too much about him.,3
The Eric Border shocker was amazing,2
Snyder-Capullo was the reason I digged the New 52. Here's hoping more of their works after Metal,2
And have him be played by Joaquin Phoenix,2
Which comic is this?,1
"This, I can get behind. We've seen too many Jokers to have one in this new one, but if there's a whole arc of a twist character turning into the Joker over the course of a couple of movies, that would be amazing.",1
That would mean that we would have three simultaneous ongoing Jokers in the DC universe lmao.,2
I was watching night crawler and was thinking Jake gyllnglhall (completely butchered his surname) would be a great Joker,2
"I would be so happy with a short flashback-scene of the events from ""Joker"" watching it all from Bruce Waynes perspective.",1
I love this idea. Kinda like gollum intro in the fellowship of the ring.,1
Now that you mentioned it. It's never gonna happen.,1
"Lol this part confused me. Not because of the twist but it seems like Batman walks into a cell and Eric/Joker slams the door and locks him in. Then he reveals himself and Batman turns around (away from the cell door) and there‚Äôs a speech bubble that says ‚ÄúSoooo, Bats‚Äù and the tail also seems to be coming from behind Batman but then it shows Joker on the other side of the bars again???",1
Not really related to the topic but..  Is there an app or service where I can read DC comics?  Since the DC universe and comixology apps/subscriptions are not avaible in europe :(,1
Petition for Matt Bomer to be cast,1
"Manga has ruined my reading habits, cause I just read this right to left smh.",1
Issue title and number?,1
i need the second page... i need to see the reveal...,1
"which comic is this, like specifically. its genious and i kinda want to see how the scene finishes playing out",1
They should have a poster for the Film which is just the movie poster but vandalized by the Joker.,1
"I really don't want another Joker  Let's get some new villains like the Court of Owls, Hugo Strange or Hush",1
"I'd like to see him fully-formed as THE Joker, working as a high-level hitman for one of the warring mobs. Spoken of only in rumors - until we see him in the end. He gets a great scene and meets Batman for the first time, but is carted away - with the implication that he's just found a new purpose. He's basically just a bizarre side character at the beginning of his journey.   Then he doesn't return until part three, in which he's the main antagonist.",1
"Seems like they‚Äôre doing The Long Halloween, in which case they might do surprise Joker for a small appearance.  My pick? Joaquin Phoenix. Just do it.",2
I hope soft clown music plays in the background whenever that character is on screen.,0
"every single issue from batman #1 to the end of the new 52, to metal ( ive sort of lost track after this) every issue looked better than the last. Capullo is hands down my favorite batman artist at the moment, and any snyder story without him feels lacking.",3
"Ditto. I hope he designs a poster for a future movie or something, that would be amazing.",3
Him and Snyder‚Äôs run is my favorite run of all time.,1
Me too. I'm still waiting for Hugo Strange. Serkis would've been my pick.,3
"Several Jokers, but we‚Äôve only had one actually interact with Batman, and that was 11 years ago. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, we‚Äôre overdue for another true Joker (who's an actual Batman villain)",3
"That‚Äôs true but think of it like this, if the joker is the villain of the third Batman movie it would probably come out in 5-6 years. That‚Äôs long enough imo. That would almost be 20 years since the last the Batman wen t up against joker",2
Same. But I would like him to be in the third movie.,1
"Thank you! 100% agree. Batman has the best rogues gallery of any superhero out there and we get The Joker over and over and over again whether it's comics, video games, movies, television, etc. and it's tiresome.",1
I'm done with the joker for a good while.,1
">Maybe Mr. J is a member of Falcone's goons  I dunno why, but I always hate the origins with Joker being a criminal BEFORE he became...that the most, because its not a fall. He's not a good man who was pushed to becoming evil, he's a bad man who was pushed to become effective.",3
"This is a great point, especially since the last time we had an actual Joker-Batman interaction was 11 years ago now. WB can pump out as many Jokers as they want, but for obvious reasons, it‚Äôs not fully satisfying to me unless he‚Äôs a Batman villain, and it‚Äôs been too long since we‚Äôve had that",3
"It goes even beyond just his greatest villain. Superman has Lex and Spidey has Goblin, but they‚Äôre still the same characters without those villains. Is a Batman without the Joker even really a Batman though?",3
"BUT...  Here‚Äôs an opportunity to raise some ‚Äúlesser‚Äù villains.   Crimelord Cobblepot, Batman TAS Freeze, Video game Zyzaz, not Jim Carey Riddler etc  Let Joker rest for a bit.",2
Batman comics.  Greg Capullo/Scott Snyder run,3
Batman 2011-2016 #36 Endgame part 2,1
Obsolete word for Joker/Jester,3
"That's what I meant. Since Matt Reeves will most likely give us an already established Batman, what I'm trying to say is Joker goes into hiding and disguises himself and becomes closer to Batman before revealing himself in future sequels.",2
This isn't Joker's origin. It's an established Joker disguising himself.,2
"New 52 Batman run by Snyder and Capullo, not sure which issue I believe in the 20s maybe",1
Not the first instance of three jokers......,2
"Wow, that is actually a very good pick ! How did you come up with that ? I think he would rock as the joker !",1
You‚Äôll love Batman Last Knight on Earth too.,3
Ah yes the good ol' Afred/Strange twist,3
I feel like Michael Fassbender would be a good Strange,3
Hugo Weaving as Hugo Strange or nothing.,3
Christoph Waltz is my ideal Hugo Strange.,3
I want to see multiple villains in each movie. It's not like Hollywood is going to make more than a trilogy and batman has quite a few villains. Most of all I would love a batman and robin. There was a scene in Titans where Dick is in a warehouse and he grapples to the ceiling and the camera loses track of him and he kicks everyone's ass. I loved it. It would be nice for batman to do a little detective work too.,1
I always wanted either Christoph Waltz or Jared Harris.,1

"At first I was thinking of Burton's Batman and was like ""no way that was only 11 years ago"" then I realized you meant The Dark Knight and I thought ""no way that was already 11 years ago""",3
"Two, there was the chase scene in suicide squad",0
"^ This. Absolutely this. Kinda like Mr. Freeze, too. He was a good man driven by desperation.",3
"They could make Joker joining Falcone's gang just so he is able to survive in an already fallen gotham. And on his first day in the gang, Batman is responsible for his origin.  Technically he wouldn't be a fully fledged criminal.  Just a guy trying to survive in Gotham under the shelter of Falcone's power.",2
"What if he already had homicidal tendencies but tried to hide them? Technically, that doesn't make him a criminal(?)",1
It‚Äôs not perfect but Joker does face off against a fledgling Dark Knight in the Gotham TV show.  Joker is quite good in that show,1
"I‚Äôd argue Batman can exist without Joker, because the world of Batman is so rich, but the Joker is still tied to his identity and the lore so any form would be better than just going unmentioned.",2
"Sure, I want to see them all but with so many villains in one movie, imagine how many he would have introduced at the end of his run. I think Joker has his place somewhere in there.   That said, I‚Äôd fucking love an entire movie dedicated to Batman and Freeze.",2
Is it worth a read?,2
Any comic written by Scott Snyder is worth a read for me.,1
I get it now. That could work.,1
I wasn't referring to the panels above specifically but responding to the accompanying post which asked about whether or not we'd support a similar reveal about the Joker in a future movie.,2
I think he could pull off the role of Joker.,2
"I think he knows Joaquin is already the Joker, obviously. He‚Äôs saying that Joaquin should join in on the Battinson train.",1
"Joker's head is hilarious, too.",2
This is actually perfect.,2
It's hard to believe it's been so long. It's also hard to believe (and frankly quite annoying) that we currently have two Jokers in the mix and neither of them will be facing off against Batman.,2
That was Harley. They never met face to face. Deadshot got a face to face before Joker.,3
"Unless this is told as a flashback on the Joker film, that would be wasting a lot of time for a cameo.  I‚Äôd like for it to be like in the comics and leave it ambiguous. Like we see a goon falling down the chemicals fighting Batman, but it‚Äôs never confirmed whether that‚Äôs the Joker or not.",1
Very much so,3
Arguably the best batman run,3
Which has nothing to do with an origin story.,1
"Ofc he knows, i did not mean to imply that. It was just funny the way he worded it ‚Äú My pick is Joaquin‚Äù, as if that is not the case for most people who ve seen joker :)  thats just it.",1
"Then joker should count because Bruce had a face to face with Bruce. The chase scene counts also because Batman is interacting with joker just through actions, not through speech. And while we‚Äôre disproving that‚Äôs heath was the last one. Jeremiah and Jerome interacted with Bruce over the course of Gotham plenty of times",0
"I‚Äôll look into it then, thanks :)",2
From what chapter/title specifically,1
"Ah, I see.",1
Those are all child versions of Bruce Wayne. OP specifically says Batman.,2
>because Bruce had a face to face with Bruce  Thats some deep shit,2
"Batman was on top of his car for a couple seconds. I'm not counting that since there was no actual interaction between them (obviously Bats and Joker are at their best when there's a personal tilt to it and they're on the screen together for more than a few seconds). And on Gotham, that was just Bruce as a kid and clearly not Batman. I know you understood my point as it was a really simple one.",2
"The new 52 issues 1-40. The Batman is the series he wrote. (That‚Äôs important because they branch out to multiple storylines).  The beginning is a warm up to joker ( very brief). Keep reading because he will make a return and the story is all relevant. There is the court of owls storyline. Still good but not in direct relation to joker. Then there is the death OF the family storyline. (New 52 is the reboot of DC. Meaning that these storylines are like a parallel universe to pre 2011). Then it‚Äôs going to follow some other storylines and come to a finish with Endgame.   This is a link to a reading order if you are interested.   https://medium.com/@justinbeeson/batman-by-snyder-capullo-reading-order-e8cf77e711fc  Also... both DC and Marvel decided to thread storylines together when they rebooted. Meaning it‚Äôs not like the old graphic novels that was reading a singularity. The new graphics novels are a bit tough if you are not prepared to be reading an insert with a reference to another issues from another persons storyline.  (During Snyder‚Äôs writing there is a  Batman‚Äôs storyline Night wing storyline  Batman and robin storyline Batgirl storyline  And they are all written by different people.)  This is hands down my top 5 favorite Batman stories and recommend anyone to read. However, I want to give you the benefit of knowing what you are getting yourself into.",3
I mean you could argue the Batman personality showed up after the murders  Also Jeremiah Valeska met an early Batman,0
"Goes without saying, but Court of Owls was fucking amazing.  I'm so happy that I picked that up.",2
His best work.,1
I really agree with this.,3
How long have you been here?   I‚Äôm only saying this because for 2 years I got annoyed with the Snyder cut posts. But what the Snyder people did last weekend caused a dent. In my opinion the Snyder Posts went from undesirable to undeniable.   If this happened during BOP release then I Woukd have a problem but we ain‚Äôt in feb fam,3
"A megathread would be also good, since it would help the discussion too. Now we see identical pictures posted  one after the other without offering any new information.",2
"Let‚Äôs talk about how fantastic tonight‚Äôs episode of The Flash was, then.",2
What exactly do you want to see right now though? the variety in posts won't change till December when hopefully we get a trailer or two or dc news at the con. It may seem like a lot but that's because there isn't much going on,2
"Just curious, what do you wanna talk about right now? There's very slow news of Batman castings. Joker has been analyzed adequately and there's not much more to say about it. Next week, the marketing campaign for WW84 is going to begin. There's nothing else to talk about right now. If this bothers you, don't check the subreddit for a while. Otherwise, you can go over to /r/DCcomics and discuss there instead.",2
"I would love that. The large number of Snyder Cut posts are clearly bothering a significant chunk of the subscribers to this subreddit. Hopefully the mods take notice and implement your suggestion, or something similar. It would be a win-win.",2
Lol what else are we supposed to talk about though.,2
"100% agreed. It's always been tiresome but now it's absurd. It's the DC film sub, not the Snyder sub. I mean, is it fucking necessary to make a thread every time someone likes a tweet?",2
"Oh yes, this would be great! Maybe we'll get less bs comments from Snyder haters then.",2
"That is not fair to the fans of his work on the DCEU. Part of the rules on this forum are to able to talk about all these films, past, present and future. Any new information of these movies is supposed to be discussed here. It just so happens that recently alot of discussions have been around the Snyder cut of Jsutice League because it is a hot topic and, no offense, we really don't have much else content to chew on. No new movies for while, Joker hype seems to have died down. So right now this is the topic. We don't tell people to stop flooding this form with Pattinson related stuff. I only say all of this because I made a similar mistake and got banned for it briefly and don't want you to make that same mistake. We can't be thought police or censure discussion about these movies we like.",2
What is the big deal lol? Up until a month or so ago this reddit was constant Pattinson and current DC stuff. The Snyder Cut is just the current topic of discussion. If you don‚Äôt like it maybe change the conversation and post a thread regarding another topic?,1
"You're basically just trying to silence the Snyder movement.. That's how it starts.. Giving people the option not to have Snyder means you're not supporting everything he stands for.   You have to remember, with the exception of the black label properties like *Joker*, this is the Snyderverse, I think you're in the wrong place if you don't want to hear about him lol.",1
I‚Äôve been here for two years. But I deleteD my posts because some creepo doxxed me.,1
I believe /r/Arrowverse would be the best place for that discussion. This subreddit covers just the DC films.,0
"Yes, and fancasts are also really annoying tbh.",1
lol hopefully.,1
"How is that unfair to fans of his work? The op is suggesting an optional filter that users can choose to use if they don't want to see Snyder Cut related posts. Fans of his work will still be able to see it. If anything, fans of his work should be excited by the thought of such a filter, because they would be able to more freely discuss Snyder Cut topics without being downvoted.",2
I‚Äôm not asking anyone to get censored. I just want the option to filter out the posts without having to jump through a bunch of hoops.,3
"You‚Äôre acting like Snyder fans would be oppressed by the creation of a Reddit post flair.  Snyder fans are not, and will never be, oppressed.",1
I‚Äôm fully aware. It was a jo....  Forget it üòî,1
"Should we have filters for people that dont want to hear about Pattinson? Or for people that didn't want to hear about Joker? Or People that don't care for WW84? No, because the moment you do that, the moment you just start deciding what should or should not be filtered or is relevant enough to stay on the forum universally. The only things that should be removed or filtered are the things that the mods seem inappropriate for this thread.",1
"I have to do the same with other posts I dont care about. I think we all just have to deal with it. We can't just have a ""No Snyder Cut mode"" just because you dont want to deal with it.",1
We are currently being oppressed.  By that demon Joss Whedon lol,1
"If there were an overabundance of Pattinson threads, that were also repetitive and were not being removed in a timely manner, then yes there should be a filter. Same for any other topic that fits that description.",2
"If there‚Äôs a no nonsense mode and a no jokes mode, a no snyder cut mode wouldn‚Äôt hurt anyone and maybe even improve discussions for those that actually want to discuss Snyder‚Äôs Justice League. It‚Äôs a no lose situation for all affected parties.",2
"> We can't just have a ""No Snyder Cut mode"" just because you dont want to deal with it.  Why can't we? Because you want to argue with people about Snyder? What a weird take.",2
No because now it puts it on a different level. It should be treated the same just as everything else.,1
I want the discussion of the Snyder cut to be open to everyone just like any of the other movies. Even if I agree or disagree with them. Open conversation.,0
Exactly. It should be treated like everything else and be given its own tag that allows those who want  to filter it out to do just that.,2
"The hypothetical filter is optional, so it would not be forcing anyone out of Snyder Cut discussions. They would literally be choosing to not see them.",2
"Nobody is forced to sort by posts via. the filter, so all it means is those who have no interest in discussing the ‚ÄúSnyder Cut‚Äù won‚Äôt have to see posts about it.",2
So should we have a Pattinson and reeves tag? A patty and Wonder Woman rag? A Gunn and Suicide squad tag then?,0
"That's still treating the Snyder Cut posts different than other posts. If I can't filter out Pattinson hypothetically, then equally, the SnyderCut stuff should be allowed to say unremoved unless it breaks the moderators rules.",0
Those wouldn't benefit from its own tag since they don‚Äôt have a dedicated ‚Äúmovement‚Äù behind them that organize mass tweeting.,2
"Snyder Cut posts, and Pattinson post, are no where near the same in quantity. Snyder Cut posts are also not being modded efficiently enough. Repetitive threads linger for quite a while before being removed, if they are even removed at all. That is not the same for any other regular topic that is posted on the forum at the moment. If there suddenly was a huge influx of Pattinson posts that equaled the Snyder Cut posts in quantity, then I would support a filter for that as well. But guess what, nothing will ever come close to the number of Snyder Cut spam we have been getting.",2
"Which has no relation to the posts on reddit. They don‚Äôt organize that. Some are even from people not part of the movement, just guys interested and curious. And these posts are happening because there is news about the cut, not out of nowhere. When the next big news about the other films comes out, there will be a bunch of posts about that.",1
How are they not related when the mods here make a huge announcement about joining in on the tweets?,2
"One mod made an announcement for something happening on Twitter. It wasn‚Äôt to flood the sub. What the movement does is kept to Twitter. What happens here is for Snyder fans who are also part of this community and others who are curious would like to discuss things. And discussion of the Snyder Cut is not simply a movement thing, it falls in line with what this sub is for.",2
Viggo as anything tbh,3
"Viggo wasn‚Äôt sure about playing an Italian-American in *Green Book*, so I‚Äôm not so sure he would want to do it again.",2
Maroni? his a fall guy!,2
I want Tim Blake Nelson. Reunite him with Turturro.,1
Let's get Italian actors playing Italian characters.,1
Michael Bacall doesn't really act... so I dunno why you'd want him?,1
"Gotta strong feeling this isn't a TLH ""adaptation"".",1
I'm the brains of the organization.,2
Order! Order!,2
Well that's not exactly fair. How many times do people spam things whenever Reeves confirms a casting or when Pattinson has a interview? It goes two ways.,3
Smash that unsub button fam,3
"You can always create a new sub. Go, do it. Leave us alone.",2
"Dude, the reason tons of things get posted is because new stuff comes out every day from Snyder, Momoa, etc. It's a popular topic, that's not gonna change. Just like a few months back when BoP stuff was posted 1000+ times a day, or before that when Joker stuff was rapidly going up. Or now when we see as much Battinson stuff going up. People who aren't interested in Battinson don't complain that there's too much on the sub. Because it's just a naturally popular topic. If you're not interested, you can skip past it. It's really easy to just scroll some pixels down past it. Lord knows I honestly couldn't have cared about Joker stuff at first (Yeah, I wasn't on board until the later trailers). I still dealt with it.",2
You can go to r/Dcfilm,2
Now this is what I call a pipe dream,3
Not gonna happen when the leadership here are the main ones here in the Snyder cut movement.,2
"Not tryin to be rude but you are just going to have to deal with it. No doubt there are people on here that aren‚Äôt exactly open to the new direction of the DCEU and have to put up with constant posts about Pattinson, etc.",3
"Couldn‚Äôt agree more, I mean for 1 months all  related Joker posts were filtered under some shady pretense yet they‚Äôre letting the sub get highjacked with random Snyder related posts.",2
"Why don't you spend your time and energy being positive about what you love (be it Matt Reeve's The Batman, the MCU, Star Wars, DCEU, or whatever) instead of spending your time being negative?   # Find solace in the privilege to pursue -- Most people are crushed into servitude.   I suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and thinking about the world-building in the DCEU chiefly by Zack Snyder makes me happy and helps me escape and cope with life. Find your passion, follow your bliss.",2
"Granted, reposts are irritating. For instance, we already have two threads about Danny Elfman's thoughts on the Snyder Cut, even though it's technically old news since he was reported to have said that a few days ago. And most of the ""Will the Snyder cut be released"" threads are just as much a retread as the ""How I would have rewritten the DCEU"" posts, which I'd argue are even more tiresome.  However, most of everything else is reporting on articles and/or people with credibility (IE Snyder himself) posting new pictures or revealing more information about JL, which is technically ""News"" and related to the DCEU, which makes it just as relevant to post about as any new casting, screening, shooting, writing, etc. piece of info that comes from Flash, The Batman, Birds of Prey, WW84, The Suicide Squad, The Trench, Black Adam, etc.    So I really don't see the point in complaining as, like it or not, Snyder had a lot to do with the current DCEU which this sub is dedicated to discussing.",1
"I could have sworn the description of the sub said ‚ÄúYour one stop shop for DC news and discussion, AS WELL AS PAST DC FILMS AND VERTIGO ADAPTATIONS!‚Äù or was I mistaken? Snyder‚Äôs films are DC films and are still part of the cinematic universe. They still count. If you have an issue, you can hide them, you can block the people who post them, or you can just ignore them.",2
"Yes, more shitty fanart and lazy fancast posts please mods",1
Release the Snyder cut!!!!!!!!!!,2
"I really don't understand posts like this. Whether you like him or not, Snyder was the chief visionary for the entire DCEU, and whether he's making any more films or not WB is still continuing on with his Wonder Woman and Aquaman. And most importantly, the film being discussed is an unreleased alternate version of a Justice League movie. The Justice League is the apex of all DC Comics, a team of DC's biggest heroes. Of course that's going to get way more attention than anything else, especially given the very public series of events which resulted in a completely mediocre studio cut of the film. And now the stars of the film itself are joining in the call for the original cut. What do you see as more important to discuss right now than this? As fans, we're all excited - or at least hoping for the best - when it comes to upcoming projects like The Batman, Black Adam, ect., but outside of the little bits of info that come out (which do get traction here), there's not much to talk about with them yet. Meanwhile Snyder and other crew members are dropping atomic bombs into this fandom on a weekly basis. I honestly cannot understand how a DC fan wouldn't be thrilled over the possibility of a basically all new and less compromised version of a Justice League movie.",2
"Behind The Scenes content of any DC film is relevant to this sub. Discussion about alternate cuts of DC films are also relevant. The JL Snyder Cut and BTS posts are on topic just as any BTS content would be for any other DC film.   This sub started off as a DCEU sub and later expanded to all DC films. You will find a lot of Zack's fans here because this is the place where people came because they were fans of Watchman, Man of Steel, and BvS. However, you will also find a lot of people here who are indifferent  to his take on the DCEU or outright hated it. We are an inclusive community.   The reason you are seeing such a large influx of Snyder Cut content is because new information and images has been revealed by Zack, and other people who were involved in the film. Right now there is a push in the fandom to bring the knowledge that the SC exists to the mainstream, and to campaign for its release.  I understand that you may not care about the SC, but you don't have to click on those threads. Instead, join in on any of the Birds of Prey, Joker, Black Adam, WW84, Aquaman 2, and etc.",1
I‚Äôm right there with you boss. I just try my best to ignore a majority of those posts. We just need more Batman/WW84/BoP/SS news. Thankfully CCXP is right around the corner.,2
r/DCFilm  A place for DC film fans that are tired of hearing about the Snyder Cut.,2
This is a sub for all DC related info. There are fans here that love everything or something about DC. we all wanna share or talk about what‚Äôs happening and right now this is a hot topic. The reason there are so many posts about this is because majority like to talk about the Snydercut and are fans. So no let‚Äôs not stop because a few are getting upset. Don‚Äôt like it keep scrolling. This shouldn‚Äôt make you suffer in life,1
You sat patiently and quietly for weeks? Try 2 years. Let's not pretend this isn't warranted. It's relevant to the sub and the information is broad enough to not be under one thread. Blame WB for not releasing the Snyder Cut yet.,1
"I suggest you find someplace to discuss DC stuff, this sub is already taken. No point trying to turn it back. Let them have their fun.  Funny... I used to hate r/movies because I though they are bias toward DC stuff. But now I find the discussion regarding DC there seem more interesting than here due to many different view point.",1
"Agreed. I don't feel MoS captured the essence of Superman. I didn't like BvS. I don't think Snyder would have directed a good JL movie.  But even if you disagree, it's over. He wasn't a box office success for WB. He's never going to do more DC films. Releasing the arguably imaginary Snyder Cut isn't going to change anything.   Let's look forwards, not back.",0
"And yet you just made another Snyder Cut post, as did somebody else saying exactly the same thing.",0
They always get removed but the most commented one stays. But duplicate Snyder cut posts always stay up.,1
yeah they mods here have banned people for speaking out against snyder and I got a week ban for simply telling people my opinion on BVS. the mods are really weird,0
"Exactly! Its supposed to be a open forum for all things we have, had, and hopefully will get to enjoy.",2
I‚Äôd argue that as of late there‚Äôs much more influx of Snyder related posts than anything else. Thankfully we get a new casting announcement for Batman that allows for a different topic of discussion every now and then. Also there‚Äôs much more about the future of DC that allows for discussion as opposed something from the past that were unsure will even see the light of day.,2
There aren't constant posts about Pattinson though,1
Well not really. Considering this is a subreddit about DC Cinematic. Not r/DC_What_Could_Have_Been. If Snyder fans don‚Äôt want to talk about movies we‚Äôll actually see they can go to r/Znyder,1
People hate being wrong. They followed all the lies and grew to believe them and dedicated a lot of time talking a lot of shit. Just to find out that all the shit that came out about JL is proving to be mostly false. The problem with this sub is the tide has turned. Now more people want it than don‚Äôt want it. And now the loud minority is becoming the ones that still don‚Äôt want it to come out. For whatever their reason is.,2
Lol the first post I see is the pic that Snyder just released of William Dafoe,2
There is r/Znyder for his Snyder cut fans,1
No one's asking to stop. Simple ask is to be able to opt-out. Just make a SnyderCut flair so it can be filtered. Don't think it's that big of a deal.,2
"‚ÄúImaginary Snyder cut‚Äù is the exact reason it‚Äôs getting posted. I used to be a little indifferent until I found out the fucking movie was done and the effects are done. Look at the shots he posts... it‚Äôs always from within the film, not still photography. WB fucked up big time. I don‚Äôt think anyone will stop until it‚Äôs finally released, and they shouldn‚Äôt.",2
"Well, heres the thing, seems like their mindset of movies is clearly backwards, so why not look forward to the snyder cut if that's the case? Maybe the best way forward is to look backwards.",2
"Imaginary cut? Yup, you can fuck right off my guy . I‚Äôm all for looking towards the future , but what does that have to do with releasing the Snyder cut ? Just because WB releases doesn‚Äôt mean they are gonna start using his ideas again . WB are at fault here any way you look at it , they need to release it and get it over with .",2
It Exists Though. It's not imaginary.......,1
"I‚Äôm a big supporter of the Snyder cut but it definitely is annoying seeing multiple posts of the same story being posted here, prime example is that Danny Elfman story .",2
"Well there were different things today. Not the same thing. The things that did get repeated (like for instance the variety article) got removed. But he had a bunch of new pics for us today so that meant more things to post about. Plus, I still see some things NOT being removed regarding Pattinson and other things when they get duplicate. It happens. No one is harrasing anyone by having these posts. We can't be thought police.",2
"I mean, there‚Äôs been an influx of Snyder related news so of course.",2
As a joke,0
Thank you for making absolutely no sense and no point.,1
">they need to release it and get it over with  Why though? What benefit does it do them?  And yeah, WB are at fault. For handing him the keys to the cinematic universe and allowing him to drive it into the ground.  And I said arguably imaginary.",0
Thank you for not being able to comprehend what I said. I understand it may be a little bit beyond your level of thinking.,1
"It‚Äôs not arguable though, it does in fact exist . And I never said WB should put any money into it at all, release it as is . I don‚Äôt get the argument here . It would drive subscribers to their new shiny video streaming service . And WB is at fault for not having any balls of properly firing him after BvS . They let him film JL and used his family tragedy to completely film another movie and slapped his name on it . So yeah , FUCK WB",2
That might be because you didn't say anything worth thinking about mate.,2
No I did but you just clearly didnt read it and take the time to understand what I mean. Sometimes on life you have to look backwards in order to move forward. It's basic introspection 101 and human reflection. If you don't get that then I'm sorry. We've all done it.,2
I'm sure WB has done a fine job of that internally. And they've made some good movies since JL.  There's no step in your process that requires **us** to see the Snyder Cut.,1
"Well see now my point makes sense? However, keep in mind, the overt profit sharing, wanting to make Joker a comedy and giving Todd Phillip's a small budget to ensure he doesnt make the film, trying to meddle with Aquaman while James Wan worked on it. Not really having a clear sense of where they want to go either these characters beyond just a bunch of standalones. Sounds more like WB on the verge of an Identity Crisis  And actually there is a step in my process that would mean the Snyder Cut is key. If WB took a moment to reflect on what they should do next, what did work in the past, what they did wrong but notice that clearly going with the current direction isn't as exciting as fans would hope, so maybe they need to step back and bring back some of the things that were working before. The Snyder Cut is part of that. Going back to a movie that they screwed up with with, after releasing the shitty Theatrical Cut, and going back to a formula that was unique or different and not the same old nostalgia stuff or woke stuff.",2
I never thought about it that way. These movies just keep giving new layers.,3
Really nice analysis üôå,3
"I kinda saw the last fight with Zod as that. I mean he makes it pretty clear he has nothing left, and even if he killed everyone on Earth, he'd still have nothing. And then there was the thing with the family in the train station, Zod could easily have killed them, he was simply goading Superman into doing it.  As for the notion of 'a good death', they don't explain it in the movie, but it could for all we know be a byword for a Kryptonian soldier accepting that death is an option and that they simply embrace it, meaning they stop being worried or scared of it. The other thing is that it could be something like how it was in Sparta, where you had to die in combat to have died honorably regardless of what you otherwise did in life.  The thing about the fight with Doomsday... I kinda saw that more in the vein of Superman accepting that Doomsday is ultimately a Kryptonian problem and should be solved by Kryptonians (with him being it despite the risks). This ties into another reason why he doesn't pass the spear to Diana or Batman, it's his responsibility Doomsday is put down.",3
Interesting if that‚Äôs what was intended. It makes complete sense too. I was under the impression that Zod accepted defeat and just wanted to hurt as many people as he could.,3
Isn‚Äôt this like common sense,2
"Never picked up on how Zod switches off his heat vision when Clark begins pulling his neck (The point is made in the comments). But they're right, I've watched the scene. Makes sense too, since otherwise Clark would've pulled the heat vision towards the family.",2
So I'm not the only one who caught that!!  (Crying tears of happiness üòÖ),3
It‚Äôs things like these that really give me an headache when I read people whining online on how supposedly ‚Äúpoorly/lazily written‚Äù these two films are.,2
Great read!,1
"One thing you will never get from the MCU, layers and layers of story telling",2
"And that's what the niche fan base prefers over other cbm's - it's depth. Watchmen also uses a variation of the ""greater good"" mentality.",2
"I think in all three instances, Zod/Batman/Doomsday, there's aspects and details that just make this interesting character arc get lost.  Firstly with Zod there's the simple problem that Clark never reflects upon or even acknowledges what happened that day. He has an anguished scream after he kills Zod and then the only other time he alludes to that day is when he tells Martha ""I just wish dad had been here to see it"". Hardly the words of a man struggling to process the gravity of those events.  With the Batman v Superman fight the implausible way in which he tries to ""reason"" with Batman just doesn't help to sell that he's actually learned anything from his previous experiences. Instead of simply trying to restrain Batman he pushes him violently down and street and then throws him for good measure too. How could he possibly expect Batman to listen to him after that? People aren't going to buy meaningful character growth if a character acts in a way that's just not believable.  With Doomsday the issue is simply that the execution made his sacrifice look unnecessary. ""Why not just give the spear to Wonder Woman?"" If the execution was believable nobody would ever think to ask that question. If you show the audience *and superman* that Wonder Woman is invulnerable and a skilled fighter then you have to take her out of commission in a believable way that would leave Superman with a tangible choice to make. Sure he's *kinda* shown making a choice. (This is my world, you are my world). But him making that choice doesn't undo the fact that it looks unnecessary. If he *actually* had no choice then it would have felt far more meaningful.",1
Still doesn't explain how Zod got his ass beat by Jor-El,1
"I disagree. I don‚Äôt think Zod wanted to die. Dying because you want to is not ‚Äúa good death‚Äù. I do think he‚Äôs ready to accept it if Kal is able to defeat him though, which is different, and closer to what Snyder meant as well.   Superman wins because:  1. He‚Äôs been basking under the yellow sun for nearly 30 years as opposed to Zod who‚Äôs been doing it for like a few days, so he‚Äôs stronger. Zod is the better fighter, which is why he can make up the difference.   2. He still has a purpose. Something Zod clearly states he doesn‚Äôt have anymore. Zod‚Äôs only motivation was to hurt Kal as much as possible.",0
Superman always has a choice. He didn‚Äôt need to kill him. He could have imprisoned him thus taking Zod‚Äôs victory away from him.,0
"I've never bought into the pass the spear to Wonder Woman or Batman anyway. To me hhere wasn't time to plan it out. She had him confined with her lasso and Batman had just fired the grenade, the time was now. Superman didn't know he would die just that he might.",3
I always thought he went in the direction that the family was but also up at the some time because Zod was pulling that way.,1
"My issue with this scene is that he's basically unable to move his eyes because he's in a headlock. I felt like Homelander from The Boys shows how truly deadly having heat vision is, no head movements, it's all with the eyes. Unless the family was actually at end of his eye line and he was looking as far too the side as he could would the headlock make sense but they're right in front of him.",0
*static and white noise*  ***YOU ARE NOT ALONE.***,3
"Whenever people post that, I've noticed that they always argue in bad faith or theyre purposely misinterpreting the scene. People just WANT to thrash Snyder's movies even when it doesn't make sense.",1
"He obviously struggled with killing Zod that doesn't mean he can't be proud of what he accomplished. Saving the whole world.  Batman wasn't a threat, he was a broken man standing in the way of Martha's safety. He could have killed him in an instant. He didn't want to. He also didn't have a clue that Batman had a beef with him. Why would he? Batman won't listen to him so he shows him what's what. What human is going to argue with it? He's expecting Batman to comply because what other choice does Batman have, after all he can't hurt Superman...  Wonder Woman was already restraining Doomsday and he was about to release a huge wave of energy again and become more powerful. Time was a luxury they didn't have at all. Organising Wonder Woman killing him with the spear isn't an option. The time was now and he took it.",2
"He did try to reason with Bruce, then Bruce didn't understand. Clark simply pushed Bruce to attempt to force him to listen, he didn't know Bruce was as far gone as he was, nor did he know there were Kryptonite weapons.     With Zod, do you really think we need some drawn out monologue from Clark telling what is already shown in his anguish? We don't need to be told how he feels, we see how he feels. It's supposed to be show don't tell and you're asking for more of the latter.",2
How the heck superman can pass the spear to wonder woman?? It is obviously wonder woman is busy tied up doomsday and batman is shooting doomsday with grenade in order to give the perfect opening for supes to impale him with spear. It all goes well until wonder woman got slipped up which is rather bad luck case. Plus you can clearly see doomsday keep building energy after wonder woman chop off doomsday hand so the situations is definite very dire there and no time for supes to keep delaying around.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  This tweet explain it best:  [https://twitter.com/Only\_Grey/status/1198837692898918400](https://twitter.com/Only_Grey/status/1198837692898918400)    [https://twitter.com/Only\_Grey/status/1198616894191878146](https://twitter.com/Only_Grey/status/1198616894191878146)    [https://twitter.com/Only\_Grey/status/1192917126677516288](https://twitter.com/Only_Grey/status/1192917126677516288),2
Who wouldn't get his ass beaten by Russell Crowe?,3
Cause Jor el is badass,2
">I disagree. I don‚Äôt think Zod wanted to die. Dying because you want to is not ‚Äúa good death‚Äù.  He did want to die. To Zod, Clark took away the thing that gives his life purpose. Remember that Zod was genetically bred to only protect Krypton, now that Krypton is dead, Zod has no reason to live.   His good death would be him being killed in battle, something that he'd consider honourable.    >and closer to what Snyder meant as well.   Snyder has already said Zod essentially wanted to commit suicide by cop.  >Zod‚Äôs only motivation was to hurt Kal as much as possible.   It was to push Clark to the point of killing him, making him suffer as much as he could along the way.",3
"> I disagree. I don‚Äôt think Zod wanted to die.   Yeah it's that classic ""I mean to do that"" argument. Zod's main goal after Superman destroyed his last hope for Krypton is to destroy his people. At the end of the fight he's just too manic to think straight about what he's doing and how vulnerable he is in that moment.",0
Where? What prison?,2
"Different settings, different worlds, different mechanisms of heat vision. Personally I like the DCEU approach to it, shows how unstoppable and dangerous it can be. Most versions are kinda too elegant and precise for me.",1
Hahahaha!,2
Amen to that bro. Or sis.,1
"> He obviously struggled with killing Zod that doesn't mean he can't be proud of what he accomplished. Saving the whole world.  Sure. But him never bringing it up again in any capacity after that doesn't help in terms of it supposedly being a significant part of his character development.  >Batman wasn't a threat, he was a broken man standing in the way of Martha's safety. He could have killed him in an instant. He didn't want to. He also didn't have a clue that Batman had a beef with him.  ""Ripe fruit his hate.."" Plus why wouldn't Batman have beef with him after he thrashed his car and threatened him? And he knew that Bruce Wayne was Batman and that Bruce Wayne hates Superman.   >Why would he? Batman won't listen to him so he shows him what's what. What human is going to argue with it? He's expecting Batman to comply because what other choice does Batman have, after all he can't hurt Superman...  ""I have to convince him to help me"" Throwing a person around who, as far as you know, can in know way harm isn't going to convince them of anything other than how right they were to mistrust you. Superman took a big risk and that suit protecting Batman with that first push. And he took an even bigger risk smashing him through a building and slamming him into that light.  The bottom line is if Superman's attempts to reason with Batman are totally illogical then people aren't going to buy into the character development.  >Wonder Woman was already restraining Doomsday and he was about to release a huge wave of energy again and become more powerful. Time was a luxury they didn't have at all.   But there's nothing to suggest any of the characters knew what the others were doing. Superman flies off before she throws the lasso and she throws the lasso before he shows up. That's not coordination and a race against time. It's just a lucky coincidence.   >Organising Wonder Woman killing him with the spear isn't an option. The time was now and he took it.  We never get to see him facing any such dilemma. And the fight started with them all managing to survive a blast from Doomsday so they had time. Now if the fight had migrated to an area where there were some people in danger of being killed then it would make more sense and actually give us a moment where Superman has to make a tangible and meaningful choice. As it is he sacrifices himself because it suits the story but not because the situation actually demands it. That's why so many people found it to be an empty moment.",0
"Yeah, definitely asking a lot of ‚Äútell‚Äù here.",1
">He did try to reason with Bruce, then Bruce didn't understand. Clark simply pushed Bruce to attempt to force him to listen  You really believe the best way for someone to listen to you is violently pushing him? And very specially when treating with a much weaker person than you that, for what you know, can do no harm to you yet you can accidentally kill him if you push him too hard?   Superman foolishly wastes time with ""Bruce, you have to listen"" and ""Bruce, there's no time"" (?) instead of going straight to the point ""Batman, there's a crazy lunatic that wants us to fight!"". It makes him look like an idiot.  And the worst part is that Superman could have said it to Bruce and yet Bruce can simply not believe it, or state that he will deal with Lex once he had taken care of this. Instead, the writer chose to let Superman be an idiot.",1
> How the heck superman can pass the spear to wonder woman?? It is obviously wonder woman is busy tied up doomsday and batman is shooting doomsday with grenade in order to give the perfect opening for supes to impale him with spear  Which would be fine if Superman knew any of that was happening. He didn't. And they didn't know he was coming either.  >Plus you can clearly see doomsday keep building energy after wonder woman chop off doomsday hand so the situations is definite very dire there and no time for supes to keep delaying around.  Yep. But again Supes doesn't know any of that either.,0
"Makin' movies, making music and FIGHTIN' AROUND THE WORLD!",2
">Snyder has already said Zod essentially wanted to commit suicide by cop   ‚ÄúI wanted to create this scenario where Superman is going to see those people get chopped in half, or he‚Äôs got to do what he‚Äôs go to do. And I think Zod knows that. It‚Äôs **almost** [suicide] **in a way**, it is, it‚Äôs **like** death by cop, you know **in a way**. In my mind **if Kal has the ability to kill him, then that‚Äôs a noble way for him to die**. It‚Äôs like that whole ‚Äògood death is its own reward‚Äô concept in the movie.‚Äù  To me, that suggests Zod was ready to accept death, not that he wanted to.   But that‚Äôs my opinion.",0
"Except Zack Snyder says Zod was doing a Suicide by cop, so he wanted to die. And Zod says either Superman dies, or he dies. If Zod really wanted to live and just kill people to hurt Superman, I don‚Äôt think he would have made it a point to say that.",2
It‚Äôs the dc universe. They can find a prison to hold him.,0
"I think the scream sums it up nicely.  Yes, you are correct he did now before going into the fight.  I he did try to convince him, Batman laid on the guns and the noise machine and screamed in his face! He did take a risk but don't you think he would do whatever he had to even if it including killing him if he wouldn't desist?  In regards to this point whether it was coincidence or not doesn't matter. When he picked up the spear it was time.  They survived the blast but they aren't human are they. Batman only just, due to his cover. Doomsday could have jumped to another area within seconds. We know that Doomsday gets more powerful every time he is attacked or blows off an energy wave. It's already a difficult fight. We don't know how powerful he would become. He was about to blow again. Superman would rather end himself than Doomsday take out Bruce.",1
It's weird. A few years back the criticism people used was that MoS had too much exposition. Now apparently not enough?,1
"You‚Äôre ignoring Bruce‚Äôs whole mindset. Bruce ONLY cares about killing Superman. That‚Äôs it. He‚Äôs not listening AT ALL to what Superman is saying, he doesn‚Äôt CARE what Superman is saying. He‚Äôs so far down his rabbit hole of hate. Superman even mentions Lex before getting getting cut off by one of his traps. Hell, he CALLS HIM BRUCE yet that doesn‚Äôt faze Batman.  And then there‚Äôs the whole aspect about Superman‚Äôs MOTHER BEING IN DANGER and is on a TIME LIMIT. Superman doesn‚Äôt really have the luxury of patience, or really the capability of it. So he decides the faster way to get Batman to listen since the MULTIPLE attempts at talking didn‚Äôt work that he needs to basically knock some sense into him. To say look, this fight you want is pointless, and if I was here to kill you I would have done it already so just listen.",1
"> He didn't.  We still talking about the guy with supervision that saw the whole thing from a brief distance right?   > But again Supes doesn't know any of that either.  What is there to *know* besides what he already saw? The beast was getting more and more powerful each second and was temporarily immobilized, with no guarantee they‚Äôd be able to do that a second time.",1
Yah so what superman does not know that wonder woman and batman gonna do that?? All the more reason that superman make a choice to do this knowing he might die and u know what? This is something superman would do  Honestly i don see the issue with this whole thing. You are damn way nitpicky on this  Plus superman did see wonder woman is down when doomsday blast her away for good 40 second or so before superman went on to take a spear,1
*Tuggah!*,1
"I mean, if it's almost suicide then he wants to die, he literally has nothing left for him in the world, he wants to cause as much suffering as possible so that Clark will kill him. He considers Clark killing him a good death",2
"> Except Zack Snyder says Zod was doing a Suicide by cop, so he wanted to die.  Zack Snyder saying it doesn't mean that's how it came across in the movie.  >And Zod says either Superman dies, or he dies.

He was taunting him into a fight to the death. Are you really going to argue that Zod wouldn't have killed Superman if he'd gotten the chance to?",0
Been waiting on this particular comment. Very dumb comment,2
"Ah yes, a prison strong enough to contain a yellow sunlight exposed kryptonian on Earth, built before any Kryptonian has ever shown on the planet.",1
"> I think the scream sums it up nicely.  Sums what up? Having to kill Zod? Him being responsible for bringing Zod here by triggering the scout ship? Him having to destroy the last hope to resurrect krypton? Thousands of people dying during a fight that he brought to earth?  A lot of complex and monumental things happened that day. A single anguished scream doesn't really count as meaningful or interesting reflection on that imo. There should have been some sign in BvS or the end of MOS that he actually still gives a crap about the things that happened that day. Eating his hero cake but dreaming about the horses.  >I he did try to convince him, Batman laid on the guns and the noise machine and screamed in his face!   Sure. But none of those things mean it makes sense that he'd push Batman down a street and then smash him through a building instead of the obvious option to just hold him down and tell him that his mother is in danger. Showing us him trying to reason with Batman doesn't carry water if his efforts to do so are totally nonsensical.  >In regards to this point whether it was coincidence or not doesn't matter. When he picked up the spear it was time.  He didn't know that at that point. He decided it was time for.... reasons.   >We know that Doomsday gets more powerful every time he is attacked or blows off an energy wave. It's already a difficult fight. We don't know how powerful he would become.   Not powerful enough to stop Diana chopping it's arm off. And if you go back and watch it Superman is shown looking in the direction of the fight when she does that without krytonite right before he decides to fly off with the spear. So if you want to argue that he used his supervision to assess the situation then he clearly made a bad assessment because he saw doomsday significantly damaged by WW right before he makes that choice.  >He was about to blow again. Superman would rather end himself than Doomsday take out Bruce.  He rolled the dice on Bruce surviving the first time Doomsday exploded. If he was worried about the safety of Bruce or Lois or worried about Doomsday escaping then they should have shown actually shown that line of reasoning either through dialogue or visual cues. Have him arrive with the spear, see Bruce cowering without cover, see diana struggling to contain Doomsday and *then* decide to fly directly at it.",1
They want to be spoonfed every little detail but deny it. They won't be happy either way.,2
">You‚Äôre ignoring Bruce‚Äôs whole mindset. Bruce ONLY cares about killing Superman.  And why that should condition Superman's behavior into going violent himself?  Batman might be full of anger, but for Superman, he is still a mere and frail human being he can kill just for pushing too hard. How it makes sense to push him to ""make him listen"", as you say?   Is like you trying to make a toddler reason with you by pushing him; as angry as the toddler may be, he cannot hurt you, but you'd likely hurt him because you are much stronger than him.  >TIME LIMIT  Yeah. So don't waste time saying ""there's no time"" without explaining what's going on! Superman would rather say ""if I'd wanted, you'd be dead already"" instead of ""I don't want to fight, I'm being forced!"" How you'd explain he has time to say the first line and not the second?   >Superman doesn‚Äôt really have the luxury of patience, or really the capability of it  Um, what? What do you mean with Superman not having the capability of patience?  >MULTIPLE attempts at talking  ""Bruce, you have to listen"" ""Bruce, there's no time"" (pushes him instead of talking) ""If I'd want it you'd be dead"" You'd say that can explain anything to Bruce? Why he doesn't mention he is being forced to fight, or Lex, or his mother..?  >To say look, this fight you want is pointless, and if I was here to kill you I would have done it already so just listen  He could just, you know, explain himself instead of violently pushing people in hopes the pushed guy will calm down and listen.   Say, if someone you dislike appears to you and pushes you, you'd be more open to hear him? How is that Superman doesn't realize pushing someone is not the best way to make them listen?",1
">> He didn't. > >We still talking about the guy with supervision that saw the whole thing from a brief distance right?   Yep. But there's zero sense of that sort of situational awareness in the edit.    >What is there to *know* besides what he already saw? The beast was getting more and more powerful each second and was temporarily immobilized, with no guarantee they‚Äôd be able to do that a second time.  Doomsday wasn't being restrained by Wonder Woman and Batman when he flew off with the spear. *If* they were you could make a better argument for him having believable situational awareness. But you shouldn't *need* to make an argument for the existence of this bare minimum requirement for good dramatic action.",1
" >Honestly i don see the issue with this whole thing. You are damn way nitpicky on this  Not nitpicky. Just trying to analyse why a lot of people found the death pretty pointless and uninspiring. And making it look like he didn't even need to sacrifice himself doesn't help to make people buy into it. If we actually saw superman having to make a meaningful choice then people might not have found the death so hollow.  >Plus superman did see wonder woman is down when doomsday blast her away for good 40 second or so before superman went on to take a spear  There's no sense of him seeing any of that. Or any sense that she's in anyway significantly incapacitated by it either. We've seen her smashed across the battlefield and laugh it off like it's nothing and then chop off Doomsdays arm *without* the use of kryptonite. Are you going to argue that Superman saw something *we* didn't see, (wonder actually struggling), but didn't see something we saw, (Wonder Woman being able to inflict heavy damage)?",1
"It doesn‚Äôt really contradict the idea because otherwise he would have just gone on a typical mad villain rant about killing him and making the people suffer, Supes killing him wouldn‚Äôt be an option. But he VERY clearly told Superman that the only way this will end is either he will kill Supes, or Supes will kill him. He‚Äôs pretty much asking for it. Threatening both Superman and the people he cares for in order to get him to do it. And just think about the final scene, Zod really could have killed that family with his heat vision at any time, but he gave Superman all the time in the world. He was trying to force him to make that decision. It seems like both what the character said and what Zack said line up here.",2
"Dude, if Zod didn't want to die he wouldn't let Superman get a hold on him, or he would've just turned his head faster. He's making a point to Force Superman to kill him. Superman is only able to snap his neck because Zod let's him. Of you didn't get that, then that's your problem.",1
You don't think if Zack Snyder didn't want to have Superman kill Zod that he could have crafted a way for him to do so that felt plausible?,0
"Sums what up? Having to kill Zod? Him being responsible for bringing Zod here by triggering the scout ship? Him having to destroy the last hope to resurrect krypton? Thousands of people dying during a fight that he brought to earth?  \- How he felt after having to kill Zod.  &#x200B;  A lot of complex and monumental things happened that day. A single anguished scream doesn't really count as meaningful or interesting reflection on that imo. There should have been some sign in BvS or the end of MOS that he actually still gives a crap about the things that happened that day. Eating his hero cake but dreaming about the horses.  \- It's quite common for a movie to end and us not see the verbal reflection a character has on what happened. Especially in the sequel if it's months/years later.  We've been through the journey with them. A lot of it is implied.  &#x200B;  Sure. But none of those things mean it makes sense that he'd push Batman down a street and then smash him through a building instead of the obvious option to just hold him down and tell him that his mother is in danger. Showing us him trying to reason with Batman doesn't carry water if his efforts to do so are totally nonsensical.  \- Batman wasn't go to listen to any reason.  &#x200B;  He didn't know that at that point. He decided it was time for.... reasons.  Not powerful enough to stop Diana chopping it's arm off. And if you go back and watch it Superman is shown looking in the direction of the fight when she does that without krytonite right before he decides to fly off with the spear. So if you want to argue that he used his supervision to assess the situation then he clearly made a bad assessment because he saw doomsday significantly damaged by WW right before he makes that choice.  \- Superman was watching when Wonder Woman cut his hand off but then he swatted her away like a fly and then continued to grow and become stronger about to release another wave of energy.  &#x200B;  He rolled the dice on Bruce surviving the first time Doomsday exploded.

Why do we need to see Wonder Woman cowering? It might have made it better for but for me I simply don't need that. Did you see what the shockwave did to the city on top of Lex-Corp tower? The shockwaves were very powerful. He needed to be stopped. He knew he was a massive threat, he needed to be neutralised.",1
"Yeah. Yet people hand wave the Earth turning backwards in Superman 1. No, this is what needs long explanation.",1
"good for you analyze that. But i honestly don find it worth it to look into that given that I personally think this is very nitpicky and also this criticisms is very minor. So i'm not spending too much time looking too deeply into it. Plus i don agree with most of your statement  ""If we actually saw superman having to make a meaningful choice then people might not have found the death so hollow""  Actually we do see superman making a choice after he watch wonder woman being incapacitated, batman is nowhere to be seen and doomsday keep building up the energy. And superman decides to risk his life despite lois plea to him not to  ""There's no sense of him seeing any of that.""  Really?? I thought your problem is superman didn see wonder woman is down or situations become worse that prompt him to decides to risk his own life. Now you want to change it to superman didn need to see that?  ""We've seen her smashed across the battlefield and laugh it off like it's nothing and then chop off Doomsdays arm without the use of kryptonite.""  Im pretty sure there is a big difference between being punch by doomsday and being blast by the super laser beam and i'm pretty sure that laser beam did far more devastating damage than doomsday physical attack. Plus in the movie, you can clearly see that wonder woman have to use the bracelet and shield to block the majority of doomsday laser blast rather than taking it head on and shrugged it off like superman did. You don seriously really think that wonder woman is as durable as superman. Plus unlike superman, wonder woman did better because she is clearly shown to be a better fighter rather than just being a brute and keep on tanking a hit like superman  ""Are you going to argue that Superman saw something we didn't see, (wonder actually struggling), but didn't see something we saw, (Wonder Woman being able to inflict heavy damage)?""""

">It seems like both what the character said and what Zack said line up here.  I dunno. It looks to me like you're forcing it to fit rather than that actually making it to the screen. Superman was restraining Zod rather than Zod simply holding off daring Clark to kill him as your suggesting. If it *was* supposed to be Zod ""pointing a gun"" at the family forcing Clark to make a choice then that didn't come across in the execution at all. If it did we wouldn't be having this conversation.",0
"If Zod was left after the other kryptonians were sucked into the phantom zone, and since this is basically Superman‚Äôs first day he has no knowledge of how to contain Zod, then what is he gonna do?",1
He could have but that would have diminished the narrative that he had established,1
"> It's quite common for a movie to end and us not see the verbal reflection a character has on what happened. Especially in the sequel if it's months/years later. We've been through the journey with them. A lot of it is implied.  A single anguished scream isn't a journey though. And in no way does BvS imply that he ever thought about the monumental events of Black Zero. Obviously we can assume he must have. But there's little drama or sense of journey in that. And starting BvS by reminding us how disastrous his first day way and having him in no way mention it during the film was a pretty bad call imo.   >Batman wasn't go to listen to any reason.  Then why bother to throw him around at all? Why not just rip his head off and be done with it if he was beyond all reason? (joke--ish)   After Superman smashes him through the building and the bat symbol he still attempts to reason with him ""Stand down! If I wanted it you'd be dead already"". But there's a difference between him attempting to reason with Batman and him making a *believable* attempt to reason with Batman. His efforts are just so nonsensical that people didn't buy into it.   >Superman was watching when Wonder Woman cut his hand off but then he swatted her away like a fly and then continued to grow and become stronger about to release another wave of energy.  He swatted her earlier and she just laughed it off. If she was supposed to be incapacitated by Doonsday eye blasting her then they probably should have shown a half second shot of her unconscious or at least struggling. (And I wouldn't be surprised if they'd actually filmed such a shot)  >Why does that line of reasoning have to be verbalised?  It doesn't. I just explained in detail how it could have easily been shown visually.   ""Have him arrive with the spear, see Bruce cowering without cover, see diana struggling to contain Doomsday and then decide to fly directly at it.""  >Why do we need to see Wonder Woman cowering? It might have made it better for but for me I simply don't need that.  Because you would have had a moment of effective visual storytelling. You'd have no need for conversations like this where you explain to people why Superman had to sacrifice himself. It would just be there as part of the movie. Superman's dilemma tangible through visuals rather than assumed because her being incapacitated makes the most sense.   >Did you see what the shockwave did to the city on top of Lex-Corp tower?

Just because you didnt see it doesnt mean others didnt. You're limited by your own POV.,2
Look at the neck snap scene. Notice how Zod stops using his heat vision BEFORE Clark snaps his neck? Zod gives up when he knows Clark is about to kill him. He wouldn't have done that if he was just angry. That's like someone dropping the gun right when they hear another shot go off.,1
So you don't think Snyder could have sold an alternative?,0
"Superman declare to lois he love her and then went on to take the spear is not him decides to risk his life??  ""Both the audience and Superman have seen her being able to withstand both Doomsdays eye lasers and one of his blasts.""  Dude we see wonder woman need to use bracelet and shield to block the blast. Sure we seen her survive the blast but unlike superman, she is down for a quite while when being hit by the blast.  ""Doesn't that, along with the fact that kryptonite severely weakens superman, make her the best candidate to take doomsday out?""  Read the tweet i posted. It is clear that wonder woman is not in the position to take the spear by the time superman flies around and it is clearly logical that superman need to take the advantage to stab him while doomsday is weaken by batman kryptonite grenade for momentarily. You don seriously think that is the good time for superman attempt to coordinate with wonder woman who are already busy with her own thing. Plus wonder woman is very close to doomsday so obviously superman make a logical choice to go after doomsday rather than wasting time.  ""How is she shown to be incapacitated?""  You see her got hit by blast and then down for a while. Does that not count to be incapacitated?  ""But we've already seen that WW and somehow Batman are able to survive his blasts. Maybe if there was someone actually in tangible danger then his choice would have felt more meaningful.""  I don really think this is really matter here since it is still the same. This is just another case you personally think what would have make it better which I learn not to indulge in you on this. Also did u seriously think batman will be lucky to be survive again that blast??",1
If most/a lot of people don't see it then the filmmakers didn't communicate it well enough.,1
"Are you really trying to say that because what YOU wanted to happen doesn‚Äôt make any sense in this story, it means Snyder doesn‚Äôt have the skill to do it? It sounds like you just want a Deus ex machina no matter how weird it would be and make it Snyder‚Äôs fault for not having it make sense.   Look, just because you dislike a story, does not mean it‚Äôs bad storytelling or that it doesn‚Äôt make sense.",2
"> Superman declare to lois he love her and then went on to take the spear is not him decides to risk his life??  It's him making a choice but not because he has to.  >Dude we see wonder woman need to use bracelet and shield to block the blast. Sure we seen her survive the blast but unlike superman, she is down for a quite while when being hit by the blast.  1. She still has her bracelet and shield 2. You've just made that part up about her being down for awhile after the blast. Both her and Superman struggle against it while it's happening but then both attack *together* after it's finished.  >It is clear that wonder woman is not in the position to take the spear by the time superman flies around and it is clearly logical that superman need to take the advantage to stab him while doomsday is weaken by batman kryptonite grenade for momentarily.   Superman doesn't see that. And if he does we aren't shown it. So again we don't actually see him making that choice to strike while the iron is hot. The way it's presented he was just damn lucky to arrive when that was happening.   >I don really think this is really matter here since it is still the same.  You don't see how if the fight had moved to an area with a crowd of people in danger of being killed by Doomsday's blast would have made a difference?  >Also did u seriously think batman will be lucky to be survive again that blast??  Superman seemed fine to roll the dice on Batman surviving that very first blast instead of whisking him away to safety.",1

"You also can say he has to because doomsday keep building up energy and wonder woman or batman is not nearby. Superman is the only one near the spear  Dude i don make it up.we don see wonder woman for like 40 second or so after she is being blasted by doomsday. Then we only see her after superman declare to lois and grab the spear and fly forward. If this don count as incapacitated to you then i have nothing further to said as i have repeating this way too many times. Also wonder woman don have her shield when she is being blasted so far away   so what superman is lucky? he choose to risk his life as he is the only person near the spear and when he see he got opportunity to stab doomsday, he just go for it. simple as that.  You are nitpicking regarding about batman. when doomsday first unleash the shockwave, the scene first show batman taking cover before showing superman and wonder woman withstand the blast. so superman knows batman is fine.

"People didn't buy into it because they're still hung up on the Christopher Reeve's Superman who killed but he did it with a smile on his face Based off of the premise of the movie, there was no prison to hold Zod in. The phantom zone was closed and Clark had no way at the time to know how to open it back up again. The set up of Zod being purposeless and angry and wanting to cause pain to Clark for erasing the very reason for his existence is plenty of reason to believe he would lash out in a manner that would make Clark make the ultimate decision. It's a coherent story.  Maybe you didn't like the destruction as a byproduct of their battle, and there were opportunities to showcase Clark being shook by the destruction as a byproduct of him trying to stop Zod, but logically the final battle makes sense and him killing Zod was a reasonable action",1
"> Dude i don make it up.we don see wonder woman for like 40 second or so after she is being blasted by doomsday.  I just went back and checked it. We don't see any of that. The last we see of Wonder Woman before Superman flies off is her disappearing in a cloud of CGI dust. Whether or not she's incapacitated isn't shown at all. You've just made that up for the sake of argument.  >Also wonder woman don have her shield when she is being blasted so far away  If not having her shield meant she was left unconscious or struggling following that eye blast from Doomsday it sure would have been nice to actually see that wouldn't you think? As it is she gets hit with the eye blast in a quick shot where she's not even visible for most of it. And the next shot we see her is her throwing the lasso over doomsday. If she was incapacitated between those two shots they made no effort to show that. Why should they? Because that's just basic filmmaking. A half second shot of her unconscious following the blast an we wouldn't be having this conversation. And expecting the audience to just assume that she was incapacitated by that when we've seen her laughing off something similar isn't a well thought out choice imo. In fact her smiling like that was apparently something Gal Gadot improvised. I think Snyder should have stuck to his original vision and left that unplanned shot on the floor. It seriously detracts from the menace of Doomsday. You might think that's a ""nitpick"" but those sorts of small details really *really* matter.  >so what superman is lucky?   It doesn't make for good believable drama when things happen by coincidence.  >he choose to risk his life as he is the only person near the spear and when he see he got opportunity to stab doomsday, he just go for it. simple as that.  But he'd just seen WW, who *wouldn't* be at risk using kryptonite, inflict heavy damage on DD without it. And if you go back and watch it he's *definitely* seen her just do that right before he decides to sacrifice himself. He's seen the safest course of action for himself and everyone else but weirdly chose to ignore it. *If* we were shown her knocked out and him being aware of that then *absolutely* we people would be more willing to buy that he had no other option. But we aren't and you're having to make stuff up rather than thinking that *maybe* it would have been worthwhile to show us that.

But that means nothing if it doesn't make it into the edit where the storytelling of the scene all comes together)  >You are nitpicking regarding about batman. when doomsday first unleash the shockwave, the scene first show batman taking cover before showing superman and wonder woman withstand the blast. so superman knows batman is fine.

But the point is that if Snyder wanted to sell it on the terms you're suggesting, that Superman had no choice because Doomsday was about to explode again, then he needed to indicate why Superman felt this was so urgent when a previous blast didn't hurt himself, Batman or WW.

wow. this is exactly why i shud not be continue in this conversation. So your problem is because the film never shown it in detail that she is unconscious to indicate that she is incapacitated even though it is obviously she didn been seen around for short while after get blasted off. This is exactly why I have problem with most of your criticisms. Either it is too sublte or lack of details or too spoonfeeding in certain things. Your argument is always borderline nitpicky on whole other level.

Me taking issue with the storytelling *isn't* me not liking the story.   >Now I‚Äôm not saying liking a story means you have to agree with and defend everything about it, but you‚Äôre very negative about it most of the time.   I understand that it seems that way but I'm mostly arguing in terms of trying to understand why so many people didn't respond well to the movies.   >You‚Äôre always arguing against something about the movie.   But it's always the *execution* that I'm arguing about. Not the story.   >The stuff from you about Zack being able to come up with an alternative to killing Zod was kind of weird.  It was more of a flippant remark to a pretty flippant comment made by someone else here.  >And as for the rest, it‚Äôs just ignoring much of the criticism that these movies have gotten.  I see it more as trying to get at where that criticism is born from. And I think the GA and critics would have really enjoyed the controversial choices Snyder made if he could have crafted more engaging movies from them. I've never said that ""save martha"" was a bad idea. Just poorly executed. And when you drop the ball for some of your biggest moments people aren't going to find your movies particularly compelling. It's pretty much a basic requirement for dramatic moments to be dramatic rather than unconvincing or dull.",1
He‚Äôs funny in IT but absolutely not Dick Grayson material other than also being a male.,3
Isn‚Äôt Grayson supposed to be drop dead gorgeous? No shade.,3
"I‚Äôm probably one of few people who hasn‚Äôt watched Stranger Things or IT yet, so I know nothing about his acting skills.   Kind of has the look at least.",1
"Eh, I'm not against it. Not particularly for it, either.",2
Terrible choice,1
I'd replace him with Timothee Chalamet,0
"Nah, maybe Tim or Wally.",0
I'd rather Noah Schnapp or Timothee Chamalet. Noah's kind of short but he'll grow naturally and they can just make him look taller.,0
Best response on here,1
"Wow, that's amazing",3
Add some armor plating and that‚Äôs literally telltales batmobile. I really hope Reeves does something similar.,2
Yeah this one looks actually like a bat mobile compared to that boxy one from Tesla.,2
Well that's the coolest bat mobile I've ever seen.,1
This is the second best batmobile I've ever seen,1
"I mean most Lambos can pass for a Batmobile, but this must be the most Batmobile a car has ever been",1
I mean this looks like a batmobile was their intention. Cybertruck was just meant to be a powerful new kind of truck. Pretty different goals. Both cool in their own way.,3
Hmm well the price may be a *little* different,1
"I mean, Murcielago is literally the spanish word for Bat so..",1
Just a lil.,1
"I do not think Leto's Joker has so much future. If he is, in some way, in the BOP film then that would be his last time.   Then I would prefer it if they give the character fully to Mat Reeves if he wants to use him in some capacity.",2
"Personally I don‚Äôt want to see another Harley/joker love story bc it feels old. It‚Äôll be the same thing as the comics and cartoons. Jared Leto‚Äôs joker isn‚Äôt that great anyway, cast someone else and I might be a bit more interested",3
"I'd love to see this, but I do not think we'll get it. The writers in charge now seem to favor the direction where Harley breaks up with the Joker and gets to be in the spotlight on her own as revealed by the Birds of Prey trailer. I don't see them backtracking on that. The current DCEU will probably fizzle out as soon as the Pattinson Batman movie and the JJ Abrams Superman (?) project starts up. I think WB will keep making Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Harley, and Shazam sequels until Battinson and Superman are on solid footing, then, if that's a success, they'll try for the shared universe thing again. But with WB, who honestly knows. They seem to have no real plan so I imagine they'll do whatever they think will make them money.",1
"It depends. If Leto is in BoP, the movie will happens. It means that WB/DC is willing to work with Leto. If not, then there is no hope.",1
"They are right now making a movie that will emancipate Harley from Joker. A lovestory is not gonna happen anytime soon.  Also, Im already sick of Harley and all the Promo for BoP looks pretty bad.",1
"I would love that! I think its also an important movie for Harleys arc, to really show the abuse she goes through and then at the end her breaking up with him, maybe even stopping him. Now since they kinda put that story into BoP, without using Joker, we are never gonna get it tho... which is a shame, because imo Harley seeing that Joker is a monster and fighting back against the abuse is probably the most important and interesting story you can tell with that character.",1
I would love if they do this movie.,1
"As someone who enjoys Leto‚Äôs Joker and enjoyed the Joker/Harley chemistry in Suicide Squad, I‚Äôm very excited at the potential of this film. That being said, I agree the reception to Birds of Prey and reaction to Joker scenes in that movie will determine the film‚Äôs fate.",1
Everywhere you look in the DCEU there is wasted potential. I didn't like Leto's Joker but I think they could have saved themselves and made a great movie if they done something along the lines of 'Leto's joker is actually Robin after the original Joker drove him mad'. I think that would explain a lot and give them the opportunity to cast a new Joker while also fitting in with the story.,1
"Leto has been harrassed ever since this role didn't go the way people expected. If he's out I don't blame him.   However,  the plot of this sounds stupid. Harley and Joker are enemies. Harley is to Joker as Red Hood is to Batman. He created her but she defined who she is now. In all media, she's done with him. If we made a movie...  It would be more Harley Quinn vs The Joker. Most people would root for Joker even though you're not supposed to. If we must do it, I'd do it gang vs gang. Harley recruits Henchmen after Joker declares War (gang of Harleys) and most notably her biggest fan Harley Sinn. Joker makes huge strikes throughout but our heroine foils it. She is soon betrayed by Harley Sinn who offers to replace Harley. Dark Knight rises lampoon and Monty Python ""they all get arrested"" ending with Joker refusing to kill her. In her comic, he tortures her but later apologized and promised to leave her alone.",1
"Stop with Leto, his career is over  Bop will be a flop or an underperformance",0
Reeves Batman is totally different universe. Soo he can have its own version of Joker in his universe. Leto is DCEU Joker.,1
"There is no way they could cast someone else to play Joker alongside Robbie as HQ, it is too late for that now.",0
"We are talking like less then a month ago though that the latest source stated that WB confirmed this movie is well into development and it honestly sounds like they are committed and excited to make this thing so idk anymore.. and now a user on here is claiming that early Birds of Prey screenings included deleted SS footage of Joker and Harley, currently trying to get some proper sources from that user as we speak.",1
Problem is if BoP is a hit then they are definitely going to do another film since Margot is full on committed to the character and tbh the only avenue that would make sense after this solo Harley film is a Joker mashup and Leto is the only guy who could do that.,1
"According to legend (lol), they are using deleted scenes from Suicide Squad featuring Jared Leto.",1
"Going to agree with you on that one, only thing holding my interest is Black Mask.",1
Could easily be set before BoP in the timeline?,1
"If there's one thing that's consistent to Harley's character, is that she'll always go back to her Puddin.",1
I don't believe Leto is in Birds of Prey at all? maybe there might be a suprise cameo post credits that could potentially set up this film but i highly doubt he has any major involvement. That being said apparently WB have already confirmed that the Joker/Harley film is already in development so doesn't that mean they are already committed to it whether or not Birds of Prey is a success or failure?,1
"Lol ""His career is over"" is definitely an overstatement and how can you say a movie will flop when it is not even out yet? apparently the early screening audiences were raving over it.",1
>Leto is DCEU Joker.  That does not mean he is going to get a new movie. I think it's very unlikely that they are going to do anything else with his version of the character. He was set up as a supporting character for Harley Quinn. Their story is done.,1
We don‚Äôt know if Reeves Batman is a different universe. The only official confirmation we have is that it‚Äôs DCEU.,1
"No, it isn't. Jared Leto appeared in only one movie.",1
"Actually, Gotham City Sirens will be the next Harley Film most likely.",1
People who have attended test screenings have said that they use some of the deleted Suicide Squad Joker scenes in Birds of Prey. Whether they wind up being in the final product remains to be seen.,1
"Early screening audiences are not an indication of the success or flop a movie (cf Terminator or Shazam). A movie can be pleasant but commercially a flop or an underperformance. Look at the trailer on youtub, only 17m views. It means there is a lack of interest for this movie. Maybe it will make some cash in USA but outside I doubt  &#x200B;  Yes, Jared Leto is over, now his acting play will always be compared to his previous Joker play",1
How? Reeves has said that in an interview he was approached by Warner Bros with them saying it isn't apart of the extended universe. All the evidence we have points to it _not_ being in the DCEU. Thinking it is apart of that universe is just denial at this stage.,1
"We know. Gordon is black in his Batman movie, but it is white in DCEU. Which means different continuity. Different continuity is equel different universe.",1
"Look, you can downvote people all you want, it's not changing the fact that people picture Leto's Joker with Margot's Harley Quinn. Birds of Prey are even going to have a Joker stand-in who resembles Leto's Joker, so that movie isn't going to help dispel that. While there are tons of fanart featuring Margot's Harley Quinn with Heath's Joker, or Phoenix's Joker, they don't look right together because Margot's incarnation of the character was literally designed with Leto's Joker in mind, the tattoos and the skin dye, etc.   Jared Leto's Joker featuring in one movie has nothing to do with people's perceptions.",1
"Yep, but people still picture Margot Robbie's Harley with _him_. It's funny how things work.   It might have something to do with how Harley Quinn was designed to match Leto's Joker's design.",0
Really?! Do you have any links to the people who are claiming that? I know Joker makes a minor appearance in the trailer where Harley is breaking up with him but i thought that would be like a 5 second shot and don't think it is even Jared himself.. Interesting.,1
"Dude if you actually read into the reports of those who attended the early screenings you would find that Leto is in the film, they are using multiple deleted Joker scenes that did not make it in SS for BoP.",1
"And he later clarified on Twitter that it was a part of the DCEU but would focus on Batman. Then last year, he reiterated it would be part of the DCEU and would contain a few references to the greater world while keeping the focus on Batman. So all the direct evidence we have confirms it is part of the DCEU. It may not be, but stating definitively that it's not is projecting.",1
"Actually it doesn't. That would be a retcon. Harvey Dent race bended in the Batman quadrilogy and that didn't create a different continuity. So know, we don't know.",1
That could change especially if Margot as Harley continues to do well with audiences.,1
Studios recast people all the time,1
"Took me a while to find it: [https://twitter.com/ViewerAnon/status/1176570446784806912?s=19](https://twitter.com/ViewerAnon/status/1176570446784806912?s=19)  The 5 second shot you're referring to is indeed a body double. There is no info about Jared Leto filming any brand new scenes, although some people claim/hope that Leto recorded audio for the body double scene after he was done filming Morbius.",1
"Wasn't that when Ben was ""still"" Batman, though? Of course, a Batman movie featuring Ben Affleck would be set in the DCEU. Except that Ben Affleck was out at the stage but it hadn't been announced yet, so really that was damage control on Reeve's end.",1
"> And he later clarified on Twitter that it was a part of the DCEU but would focus on Batman.  No he didn't, he never again used the term DCEU, he simply says Batman is part of the DC Universe. Reeve's has been dancing around this question ever since he first made the statement.",0
Only two Burton movies are same continuity/universe. Other two are reboots with different actors.,0
"They've kept that design in Birds of Prey. They seem to be keeping that design. Also, given that Leto's Joker is appearing in Birds of Prey (in archive footage and as a double) I don't think Leto's Joker is going anywhere either.",1
"Yes, I am aware. Doesn't seem they're going to do with Leto, though. Considering his footage is going to appear in Birds of Prey, and he's still heavily rumoured to appear in the Harley/Joker film.",1
"Interesting! I wish he would elaborate a bit more on what that archival footage actually is.. so i take it that Leto will be shown in the film after all unless they change the final product, interested to see what they include.",1
"Yes, I think the second part I brought up was August of last year, whereas Ben was ""officially"" out by January of this year. So it could be damage control, but I'm still going to take the director's word over uninformed projections. It makes more sense for The Batman to be in the DCEU than not to be.",1
[https://twitter.com/mattreevesLA/status/900784804886568960](https://twitter.com/mattreevesLA/status/900784804886568960),1
They are still conisdered to be a part of the same continuity. Michael Keaton was planning on returning in Batman Forever but backed out.,1
"While I agree with you on it not being in the DCEU, that isn't actually true. Sadly those two other films are also in the Burtonverse.",1
"I‚Äôve heard that as well. I think it‚Äôs safe to say none of us really know what that‚Äôs going to entail or look like. I also don‚Äôt think that it means Leto is safe, his recent reaction to *The Joker* (to me) seemed to express that he didn‚Äôt feel he had a stable future at DC.  My point was I don‚Äôt think that this version of the Joker and Harley have become as iconic of a duo as you do, we are free to disagree, but truly Leto was hardly in Suicide Squad, and most of the feedback I see about the movie is lousy. The original comment was that there is no way WB could recast a Joker with this Harley (Margot). I disagree, I think it could be done pretty easily.",1
"I wouldn't agree that it makes more sense for it to be than not, especially given you just admitted that it was most definitely damage control. If Reeves was approached by Warner Bros with them telling him it's unconnected to the DCEU, and according to Pattison, Affleck had been out for two years (from now, that is), I think it's safe to assume it isn't going to be in the DCEU and Affleck was never intended to be the Batman in his film.   Jason Momoa pretty much stated that there isn't going to be any cross-over between his version of Aquaman and Pattison's Batman because ""it's it's own thing"". It's not in the DCEU.",0
They are not same continuity. Only first 2 are. 3. Burton movie was in development but it was scraped by WB. Catwoman would return in his movie.,0
"Oh, absolutely. I think they _could_ recast, but I don't think they _will_, but my opinion may change if Leto's deleted scenes do not appear in Birds of Prey.   Still, the point still stands that when people picture Harley Quinn with a Joker, it's Leto's version, because that was the version of the Joker her character was designed for.",1
"Lol, when did I admit that it was ""most definitely damage control""? I said it could be, but I would take the director's word over uninformed projections. It can be a hard reboot/retcon of Batman in the DCEU. If they do crossovers down the line such as Justice League and Gotham City Sirens, audiences will expect/want Battinson and Zoe's Catwoman to play their respective roles in those films. It can be as separate as Reeves wants and he can excercise great creative freedom over his Batman world while still taking place in the greater DCEU and giving WB the most options.",1
The 4 movies are literally considered to be a series and sequels to one another. Believe what you want to believe though.,2
"Regardless it could be a retcon. It doesn‚Äôt prove this is another universe.   If we were wandering around a real world look for clues it would be different. But since these are movies, and they‚Äôre created, and things shift and change, it doesn‚Äôt mean that ‚Äòwe know‚Äô atm.  Do I think they‚Äôre connected? Probably not. But a single characters race doesn‚Äôt prove that.",1
">Lol, when did I admit that it was ""most definitely damage control""?   Right here:  > Yes, I think the second part I brought up was August of last year, whereas Ben was ""officially"" out by January of this year. So it could be damage control,",0
"They are not. Only two Batman movies created by Burton were same universe. Other two are reboots with different actors, different tone and atmosphere. Also other two are hated, while Burton ones are loved.",1
"""Retcon"" is the word used wrongly by people. Retcon is additional explanation/information added later which does not mess continuity.  Other 2 non Burton Batman movies are not retcon. They literally do not follow same continuity as Burton movies.  For example if we find out in later movies that Batman has twin sisters. That would be retcon. But it would not mess continuity if explaned why we did not know that she exist. But if they make Batman female without any explanation in future movies, that would be reboot, new continuity, not retcon. Retcon is always something explaned logically.",1
Did you actually read what I wrote or......? You quoted something that contradicts what you're accusing me of saying lol,1
"Batman Forever and Batman and Robin had Michael Gough as Alfred and Pat Hingle as James Gordon. It IS the same universe as Batman and Batman Returns, just a soft reboot.   Heck, even Burton produced Batman Forever.   Even Jack Nicholson's Joker was intended to appear in a Scarecrow nightmare in the third Schumacher movie.   It doesn't matter if the Schumacher ones were more hated than the Burton ones, the reason they soft rebooted was because Returns was too scary for kids.    You can deny it all you want, but Warner is selling them as the Batman quadrilogy in the same way they sell Nolan's trilogy.   Shared universes and continuities were not the same in the 90s than nowadays.  But even today, we have examples like Edward Norton and Mark Ruffalo's Hulk, whose character is completely different in tone and design, yet they kept William Hurt as General Ross in Civil War.",1
"I apologize if I‚Äôve misused the word. Whatever it would be called when you change something about a character or a story or even a world. That‚Äôs all it would be. A single change, for whatever reason it may be, does not mean the film is in a different universe. Creating a string of connected movies isn‚Äôt always going to be a perfect process, there will be missteps and creators have the power to make changes without it being proof of a disconnected.   I know it‚Äôs fun to get in, to connect and believe and people want clear continuity, but at the end of the day we all know a movie is getting cast and being made- and with that some inconsistencies may arise from time to time. Again, not perfect, not ideal- but certainly not proof of anything other than these movies not being real life and me potentially misusing the word retcon.",1
"Is there a particular reason you've started being hostile? It's not in the DCEU, but it isn't that deep. You admitted that it _could_ be damage control and before that admitted (or implied) that Affleck had been out when he said this, hence why he backtracked.   Are _you_ reading what you said? All the evidence points to it being in its own separate universe, but I don't think anything is going to convince you if that director of the film saying it isn't in the DCEU won't.",0
"How am I being hostile? You were putting words in my mouth and I was attempting to clarify what I actually said.   As to your last point, I actually acknowledged that all of your points and that it may not be part of the DCEU. But I also presented facts and logical explanations as to why it could be part of the DCEU. Many scoopers believe that it will connect to the DCEU based on some of the scenarios I laid out (Justice League and Gotham City Sirens). With all of the contradicitng statements, we won't know until we know.",1
"Two things I love beyond reason, so excellently fused as one. RTJ!",1
Just sleeping on my Injustice 2 and my Arkham Knight.,3
"Gotta be **S.S** for me. That pink & blue 'do and the whole look really grew on me. I will always have a soft spot for the OG, though - and **The Batman** version of her.",3
You might remember from the [Joker post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/e0q08f/fanart_heres_my_doodle_of_the_onscreen_jokers_let/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) from yesterday. Here's my attempt at Harley. Looking forward to you guys letting me know how many I missed.  Also [here's my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joseanayaq/) if you want to see some more of my doodles.,3
BTAS Harley will always be my favorite.,3
Probably Arkham City.,2
Was 2002 the Mia Sara version ?,2
Arkham City (main game) or Suicide Squad,2
"I know how hard doing the coloring can be, so that's some damn great work on matching the dark green/maroon from Injustice",2
"I loved the design of ""The Batman"" Harley... just wish they did more with her in that show  though I do understand it was before the Harley fandom exploded",2
BTAS and Arkham Asylum mainly because it's still Arleen Sorkin,1
Do a Superman or a Two-Face version,1
2002 2004,1
Lol where‚Äôs Arkham Knight,1
"Yay you did another one of these! I especially love both Margot Robbie versions, largely due to the colours",1
Where‚Äôs the Arrow one?,1
I love the joker one you did but now I see Harley üòç Omgosh you are so talented!! These are just so cute ‚ò∫Ô∏è,1
Forgot Gotham for Joker and Harley. The tv show,1
I would buy these in sticker form,1
I‚Äôll pay $20 for a Riddler one!,1
"Bruh Harley Quinn in heroes in crisis was BUSTED. Your gonna tell me this clown girl outfought superman, wonder woman, and batman AT ONCE. BRUH BRUH BRUH BRUH. Cool art btw!",1
Dope !!,1
Arkham Asylum and of course Margot Robbie in both versions.,1
Haha very cute,1
Fr,2
I think the SS version is my least favorite. It's bad enough to scrap her entire look but they could have at least kept her signature color palette.,1
Arkham City Harley was the absolute hottest thing that college-me had ever laid eyes on.,1
"Yup. In retrospect, it was an odd version of the character, especially as it was quite a few years before her popularity really exploded. Then again, that show was a real mish mash of various continuities from the comics and the movies.",3
"I liked the whole TV 'psychologist' thing they did with her in **The Batman**. It did make her pairing with Joker seem a bit rushed and not as effective as 'Mad Love' but it worked well enough for the show. Plus, it debuted Hynden Walch as her voice, who (to date) is the only alternate to Arlene Sorkin I can stand.  Plus the slightly anime-ish design really worked with the jester suit.",1
Oh yeah that‚Äôs my bad. I haven‚Äôt seen the show and as far as I heard they never actually called the character ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù so that‚Äôs why I left him out. Also I had no idea they had a Harley Quinn on that show.,2
so glad you included birds of prey! I loved it at the time,2
They don‚Äôt call him joker but he‚Äôs definitely him - Jerome ends up with the stitched-on joker face  and everything. I‚Äôm not sure Harley ever even gets named but it‚Äôs clearly her and she‚Äôs a pretty interesting interpretation - iirc she can‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt talk at all.,0
"Not the artist, sorry!",2
She does get named and does talk,2
"haha cool, I'm glad the artist put her in anyway- that's the 2002 one!",1
I agree - it's an interesting little part of her character history.,1
I'm not white and I think MBJ as superman is the stupidest thing I've heard,3
"Even if he's playing the Earth-23 version of the character, I have zero interest in a Superman movie not being about Clark Kent.",3
"Seriously when such a news comes it just makes me think have Warner totally lost it it's like they don't know what they want and they don't care about us fans it's all about the money for them wish DC with someone else than Warner Bros, i can't take it anymore",3
Just stop. Superman is a white man the same way the sky is blue. Deal with it.,1
Gender swapping and race bending is just bad,3
"On YT you can find an interview MBJ did with Oprah where he's asked about the Superman rumors. He basically says he would prefer to play  Calvin Ellis (Earth-23 Superman) who is black. He seemed very aware of  backlash from comic book purists. I don't think temper tantrums on social media should influence the decision, but perhaps this is the idea he pitched.",1
"Forget race, I just don't think this is good casting. I'm not averse to a black Superman, but I really can't see Michael B. Jordan pulling it off.",1
IM Black and agree with your post. Not everything needs a race change.,1
"People usually aren't going to bother with smaller charcaters unless they're backed by a mega brand like the MCU, and bigger names are bigger draws.   That said, there are already examples of Black Supermen already, Calvin Ellis, Val-Zod, Tangent superman and Sunshine Superman  This isn't some conspiracy, and it's certainly not racist, if Jordan was meeting with WB about Superman, it was more than likely about Calvin Ellis or Val-Zod",2
"Well this was earlier this year/near the end of last year and it didn't go anywhere. Since then MBJ, who is a totally overrated actor, has had his plate full with other projects. Variety is just reporting of old rumors and stories and compiling it with new stuff. I mean, isnt it odd they dont really talk about Black Adam, Shazam two or even WW84 much, if at all.",1
I think from WBs point of view they've had two big swings at Superman and neither of them have really taken off like they'd hoped they would. So they might well be considering a fresh take with Vlad Zod or some other interesting variation.,2
"For starters, you're making the assumption that Jordan would be playing Clark Kent. There is nothing that suggested he would be playing Kent. As I'm sure others will point out, Calvin Ellis (Earth 23),and Val-Zod are both existing characters. A Michael B. Jordan Superman film could easily be based on one (or a mix of both) characters. Also, Aquaman was cast as the half-Pacific Islander Jason Momoa, so if that isn't a problem, I'm not sure why this would be.   Personally I think there's more to explore with the regular Kal El Superman,and I hope the next Superman movie is about him. I haven't even read anything featuring Calvin Ellis or Val-Zod. So I have no interest in those characters (but nothing against them either). But the anger from comics fans about certain ""race swaps"" seems to be completely arbitrary and inconsistent in nature.",2
I don't think he would be playing Clark but Calvin Ellis from Earth 23,2
"Some characters are just too important to change whether its race, gender, or the costume itself. I‚Äôd say Superman is one of those characters. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all though if they casted him as Superman because the DCEU is full of race bended characters, most of which I actually like: Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Commissioner Gordon, Catwoman, Deathstroke, Black Adam, Black Canary, Deadshot. So honestly its probably not a big deal either way. Betty White could be Supes for all I care as long as we get a good Superman movie",1
"Why is this even a discussion again? It was a last year's rumor that led to nothing. And also, if I remember correctly, MBJ said he does not want to play the character. In my opinion it does not make sense to make Superman black, while there are characters like John Stewart or Cyborg in the DC world.",1
I don‚Äôt think any of you read the article. First of all it‚Äôs just a pitch. There are tons of pitches sent to studios that don‚Äôt happen. Remember that Garett Evans deathstroke movie? Lol me neither. Also the article specifically said MBJ has moved on because the project would take too long to come to fruition and warner bros are still looking at all prospects. Plus this article for the most part is a regurgitation of stuff we already knew.,1
I don‚Äôt really care. I‚Äôd be on the fence with anyone else in the role not named Henry Cavill.,1
"lol MBJ pitched something and it went nowhere. WB just had a meeting with him. Thats all. And it says a Superman movie wont be likely til after 2023. A LOT can change by then. And odds are, it won't be Clark, but another version thats already been black in the comics. its definitely not that serious to consider it racist.   With JJ most likely working on DC and The Rock and the Garcia's producing a potential gargantuan hit in Black Adam and a critic/fan favorite in Shazam, they can coax Cavillt o come hack.",1
I can see him as earth 23 Superman but we probably won‚Äôt get to that point fr a while,1
"Let's all make SHAFT and black panther white, while we're at it let's have Mary Poppins as a guy and big bird BIG DONG. You're all tapped. Are these the same folks who don't want a Snyder cut?... Because, that would explain ALOTTT!.",1
I want to see him as President Superman.,1
"He would be Calvin Ellis or Val Zod.  NOW ME PERSONALLY  I would love him as Val Zod.  He looks the part for sure.  But if he was going to be in the DCEU I think they should expand with the Dakotaverse.  Give us a Static Movie, and Icon movie.  Shit would be great.  The voice actor for Miles Morales in Into the Spiderverse would be perfect for Static.",0
"Agreed. It's funny how just earlier today people were bitching in that Pre-Viz video about how Steppenwolf looks nothing like Jack Kirby's New Gods, but turn a blind eye to this.  MBJ as Clark Kent is not a good choice. Calvin Ellis, sure (Though MBJ is so good as an intimidating badass that I think an anti-hero or villain role would be better).",0
If we‚Äôre going to race bend I‚Äôd prefer someone like Henry Golding. I just don‚Äôt think Michael b jordan is that great of an actor,0
There's also the chance he might be Calvin Ellis and not Clark....,0
Superman isn‚Äôt white. He‚Äôs a goddamn alien.,0
"I don't give a shit what color he is. I just don't think he would be a good Superman. Honestly, I've just never been a fan of his.",0
This guy gets it.,3
I‚Äôm also not white and not only would it be stupid it would be disastrous for WB and the superman character as a whole,2
PREACH.,1
Say it for the people in the back!,1
Not all but yes most are just really unneeded.,1
Why is it just bad?,0
Superman as Calvin Ellis or Val-Zod is fine because they are essentially different characters. But Like race bending Bruce Wayne or Clark Kent is what I'm talking about.,2
"> This isn't some conspiracy, and it's certainly not racist, if Jordan was meeting with WB about Superman, it was more than likely about Calvin Ellis or Val-Zod  I would love to see your reaction when he is cast as Clark Kent Superman. No way WB greenlight some alternate multiverse superman when they can't get the main one right",1
DC is a mega brand,1
This I could see.,1
"I agree, MBJ is overrated.",1
"Yes that was my assumption, I didn't considerd Earth 23. But first you create a universe of Clark Kent and then you should introduce other characters.",0
"That's where I'm at. I'd like to see a non-white alternate universe Superman. Mexican Superman from *Gods and Monsters* is an absolute badass, and his origin and context were appropriately distinguished from the more familiar depictions. Like any alternate universe take, a lot of its meta significance came from its contrast with traditional takes.",0
Wonder Woman? lol. Pretty sure Gal Gadot is a white woman.,1
or STEEL. Hmmmm???,1
"That doesn't mean Kal cant be a supporting character in the ""Shazam Universe"". JSA is coming, so skies the limit.",1
I want a Static movie soo bad :( Sadly I don't think it'll ever happen.,1
Shamiek Moore. Thats who played Miles. He'd be fantastic as Virgil.,1
"Snyders steppenwolf looks nothing like steppenwolf or any of the other new gods, there's no precedent for it, whereas there's already precedent for a black superman",0

Yes. Grinds my gears thinking about it.,1
">I would love to see your reaction when he is cast as Clark Kent Superman.   I'm a sucker for comic accuracy so I'd be a bit disappointed for sure, but it's not the end of the world, in the same way that Batman not having white eyes isn't the end of the world.   >No way WB greenlight some alternate multiverse superman when they can't get the main one right   It didn't stop them from making a Joker elseworld even though the main universe already had a Joker, and now that they've got a massively successful elseworld film on their hands, they might greenlight an elseworld superman movie specifically *because* they haven't been able to get the main one right.",1
His sexiness is overrated.,1
"No. Enough with this alternate shit to just have people have their cake and eat too by using the name ""Superman"" when it's not really superman but theh decide to appease the fragile egos of a small demographic of people. Just give me Superman and then we can delve with multiverse shit later.",0
Middle Eastern technically,1
Isreali/Hebrew. Still ambiguous and can pass for white.,1
Yea I love him n dope.   He wants to play Miles in live action so we should get him in DC before he gets that,1
"Not a black Clark Kent. Which is what they're doing.  Also may I remind people of the fact that we have a black Perry White, an Israeli Wonder Woman, and a Polynesian Aquaman who look next to nothing like their main character portraits.",0
"He's fine, just like Dean Cain. They are both fair skinned.",1
"Force political agenda? First of all no one forces anyone to go watch or enjoy something that is bent in any way. Plus diversity is a good thing, casting a wider net for actors is a good thing. Invalidating talent based off of an arbitrary detail that doesn't reflect in the character seems kinda pettt Of anything it's a business move and of youbdint like it then dont watch because diversity and not just casting on race but talent seems to be catching steam and fr good reason",0
Joker is about the main version of the character. Not Martha Wayne Joker which would be a good comparison,1
"Yes, because wanting to feel represented and included by your society is being fragile...",0
Plenty middle eastern ethnic groups are labeled as white on certain forms,2
She‚Äôs the first WW actually from that part of the world we presume Themiscyra is located ( the Med),1
"There's been no word on whether or not he would be Clark Kent, but even if he was, it's the end of the world why?   But even still, people are complaining that steppenwolf looks nothing like a Kirby design because Kirby's work is so distinct and they didn't even *try* to use the source material",1
"Perry is a non MAIN character, Diana is ambiguous, and Aquaman is....well. Aquaman. Superman, the KING of superheroes is too BIG a name to race change. Unless its a Multiverse Superman, you'll be upsetting MILLIONS of americans and some fans worldwide with changing Clarks skin.",1
"I love the character War Machine and can relate to him in plenty of of the movies and comics. However I'm not upset that he isnt the same skin color as me. Now apply that to a reverse context. Also, plenty of characters that people can relate to of skin if so important to them that are those actual ethnicities. No need to race swap.",1
At the cost of a character which represents the majority of your society? What is it with minorities thinking that their cause is more important than the sum of the society's people? How entitled do you think that sounds?,0
"Do you seriously think wanting to be represented is as simple as ""I can only relate to people in my demographic""?   You can relate to plenty of characters, but getting to see yourself represented in popular culture, in politics etc makes you feel like a proper member of society",1
">At the cost of a character which represents the majority of your society?   Do you really think that if superman were a black man people couldn't suddenly relate, or its costing the movie of its character?  >What is it with minorities thinking that their cause is more important than the sum of the society's people? How entitled do you think that sounds  Its not about being more important than the sum of society, it's about being recognised as a proper member of society. What's entitled about wanting to feel like a person?",2
I wish 'muritards stopped being so dumb :(,2
"Hears the thing, no one in this society isn't NOT represented. PoC exist in shows, men and women both have leading roles, gay people and been trans people exist in shows. So no need to shoehorn a form of inclusion when it doesnt exist or isnt even a pre existing trait of the character.  The moment you change a character too much to fit a certain quota, then you're no longer adapting that character.",1
"Yes, most media has some form of representation for most demographics, but it's not a case of ""we did it in this one TV show, that should be enough"", being represented means consistent across media.   And this isn't a case of people saying ""If Superman isn't X, I can't relate to him"", it's people wanting to feel represented though different charcaters. I doubt many people are actively campaigning for Superman to be black, but if so, why is that such an issue. Don't get me wrong, I love comic accuracy, but it's not the end of the world.  But If you don't like traits being added to a charcater, are you happy that Superman can fly, or that batman is a father?",1
">The moment you change a character too much to fit a certain quota, then you're no longer adapting that character.  Here's the thing though. If you keep telling yourself these decisions are purely about diversity quotas then you'll only ever see them in those terms. Have you in anyway considered that these changes of recurring characters like Gordon and potentially Superman are motivated by the need for variety and differentiation more than ""diversity pandering""? If you *truly* believe that Kravitz or Fishbourne's castings were motivated solely by diversity then you need to step back and bit and reassess your perspective.",1
Problem is if we start changing and appeasing to every single demographic than that means of some group is not going to be represented and it's not going to be healthy and it's going to lead to the same problems that we've dealt with before that people are having with representation. Hypothetical if you have too many gay people in a show eventually people that are straight aren't going to feel represented and they going to feel isolated from the show because they can't personally relate to a gay show. It's fine having gay people and straight people are shows but you got to make sure it makes sense for the character if a character is gay or the original gay or if it's an original character and you want to make gay that's fine but going insane making a straight character gay not only changes the character because that was never a trait that was part of the character but now you're essentially just making a new character and using the name of the old character as a selling point.  Yeah it's got to be consistent across all media but also I have to make sense to. I mean by the way TV shows and movies clamor over it they make it seem like 50% of the world of the United States is gay when in actuality that's not the case. Realistically that's just not how it works so to have like 50% of like as being gay or something like that then that wouldn't be making sense and you're not representing correctly if you think of it.  Also I have no problem with adding things to the character or adding certain changes to a character but I said I have to make sense or has to be part of a pre-existing trait of the character that develops. Batman and Superman being father's is a great addition to the character cuz both of them have already had paternal instincts and are family men to a different degree and in different aspects one being lighter and one being darker so it only makes sense that Batman and Superman would both become fathers at some point. Yet again it's character development not straight up character alteration,0
I'm not telling myself that it's constantly diversity quota I'm just saying that's where it is. We've seen so many people claim about needing representation and needing representation Union representation that whenever you see these diversity quotas filled you can't help but all of a sudden be like all of this is part of that diversity representation that everyone keeps talking about kind of thing. Actually what you are saying about the whole need for diversity representation is still part of what I'm talking about. So if anything you're kind of enhancing my point. Like I said there is plenty forms of diversity in the shows and movies that we are exposed to today. Sorry it's not a hundred percent in the favor that you want or in ethnic group that you particularly want but you have to realize also there are demographics and percentages of people so it would make sense that certain groups are not in bald as much as others. Sorry that you don't understand that. We have plenty of diverse people and shows. You actually can't go two channels are two movies without looking at a fully Drapers cast nowadays. So I fail to see your argument I'm just saying that overly doing it and doing it to characters that there's really no needs to it or doing it just for the sake of it is quite frankly pointless. Because somehow making things diverse just makes things more relatable. News flash if something's relatable something's relatable. Doesn't matter if someone's black doesn't mean automatically more relatable. It doesn't matter if someone's gay doesn't mean they're more relatable. If anything saying that those people are more relatable is offensive to other people that may not be represented or have been represented but they're considered not relatable.,1
LOL dude. Holy shit.,1
">Problem is if we start changing and appeasing to every single demographic than that means of some group is not going to be represented and it's not going to be healthy.  Realistically you don't need to change anything, just use different charcaters that can represent different groups. And not everything has to represent every demographic, that's simply not feasible, but it's more about a wider representation to the point that these things are normalised, people still think that having a female led film, or a gay led TV show is pandering or ""forced"" diversity simply for existing, and that's an issue. For this specific example, we don't need to race swap Superman, tbh, I don't think many people are actually advocating for that, but that doesn't mean we can't get a black Superman in the form of Val Zod or Steel, for example.   >Hypothetical if you have too many gay people in a show eventually people that are straight aren't going to feel represented and they going to feel isolated from the show because they can't personally relate to a gay show.   Straight people are almost always the norm in a show, and that's mostly fine because straight people make up most of the population, but I very much doubt that it'll come to a point where a show is ""too gay"" for straight people to relate to.  >but going insane making a straight character gay not only changes the character because that was never a trait that was part of the character but now you're essentially just making a new character and using the name of the old character as a selling point.  How is it insane to reimagine a charcater with a different sexuality? Very few charcaters stay the way a writer originally intended, especially when you've got multiple writers over 80 years. I'd definitely prefer that LGBT charcaters get adapted over changing a straight character into one, but I think you're making it out to be a much bigger deal than it ought to be.    >I mean by the way TV shows and movies clamor over it they make it seem like 50% of the world of the United States is gay when in actuality that's not the case.   That's absolutely not true. The reason you think it's that high is because it's not normalised for you, you still think it's different or odd, but that's not your fault, it's because media representation of LGBT people has been rather lacking.  According to GLAAD for their 2018 ""where are we on TV"" report:  ""Of the 857 regular characters expected to appear on broadcast scripted primetime programming this season, 75 (8.8%) were identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer""  They also note that this is the highest they've ever recorded it, so it's a far, far cry from 50%. But again, it might feel higher to you as it sticks out more due to a subconscious bias due to a lack of media representation.  >you're not representing correctly if you think of it.  Good thing it's not anywhere near the 50% number.",0
Damn dude. That's one serious word salad *completely* missing the point I was making.,1
Haha what?,0
"You're coming across as so sanctimonious and holier than thou. I never said I found it odd or weird or wrong so don't snd talk to me like I am some unemlightened child.

No I think you're missing the point I was making. However we can agree to disagree.,0
">You're coming across as so sanctimonious and holier than thou.   I'm sorry if it came off that way, it was never my intention.  >I never said I found it odd or weird or wrong  I meant at a subconscious level, I didn't mean it in sense that I was implying you were a bigot or anything, sorry if it came off that way, I meant it in terms of a subconscious labeling of something as different because it's not as common or as represented, so when it becomes more common place it sticks out far more than usual, hence why you gave a number like 50% dispite it being much lower.  >so don't snd talk to me like I am some unemlightened child.

All I can do is ask you to read up on what representation actually is and why its important.",0
We can't if you in no way bothered to consider/understand the basic point I'm making.  You're disagreeing with arguments I never even made.,1
"Well I accept your apology but all the other posts you replied with to me were nothing but  condescending and belittling. And yes there is forced representation and it's not necessary or necessarily healthy either. And on a psychological level, playing devil's advocate, some form of prejudice and judgment is healthy. Just saying. And actually I do know why its supposedly important to people but I ask for people to look beyond that false crusade.  I used to think like you too but then I got older and realised that it's more important to be an individual and represent yourself and not have some company create representation for you.",1
Well same goes to you. I was replying to your point actually and everything I said was in reply directly to your comment so I did in fact answer the question with my opinion and replied it accordingly to what you said. However you seem to think I missed the point when actuality you are missing my point so we clearly can't see eye-to-eye on this topic. Therefore we have to agree to disagree.,1
">And yes there is forced representation and it's not necessary or necessarily healthy either.   In what way is it forced?

What kinds of prejudice are healthy?   >And actually I do know why its supposedly important to people but I ask for people to look beyond that false crusade.  Again, if you actually knew you wouldn't think it was ""supposedly"" important to people when it is important to people. And again, this isn't a case of ""I can't relate to people who aren't like me"", not being able to see yourself represented in media, politics and advertising makes you feel inherently odd and disassociated from society at large, a lack of representation is harmful.   >realised that it's more important to be an individual and represent yourself   It's very important to do this, but it's difficult for people to be comfortable with themselves when they feel on a subconscious level that they are weird or different.",0
"Superman is an alien living among humans. He doesn't need to feel represented to feel like he belongs. He just is. He just does it. He doesn't care about that. He cares about about being the best he can be.  I've been the odd man out before and yeah it's not fun. But you know what, I dont care or didnt care enough to force people to think the way I think. I just moved on. Any friends I made were welcomed to stay.  And you are essentially saying the same thing in that paragraph about ""I'm can't relate to people like me."" Doesn't matter what it is. Someone represents you as a person. Not as a color. I'm someone's friend because they are able to connect to me and vice versa. Not because me and them have the same color.   You're looking at things at too complex of a situation. It's really simple when you look at it.  I have had a learning disability but that doesnt make me feel better when I see people with other disabilities represented in shows or movies. Doesn't make a difference at all.

">I've been the odd man out before and yeah it's not fun  Im sorry to hear that, but it's basically what my points are about, if different demographics are represented more often and more widely, overtime societal consciousness shifts and less and less people feel like they're the odd man out on a subconscious level. People feel more comfortable with who they are.   >I have had a learning disability but that doesnt make me feel better when I see people with other disabilities represented in shows or movies.

"See, there you go agoan with your condescending attitude. I don't need to ""read up on it"" I know how it works.

I'm afraid of nothing like that. That's just silly and once again belittling of my opinion. You have to realise that there are people that have other opinions than your own.

Why does using an applicable meme make me a bad debater. Bad debating would be be saying your points are wrong *because* you are a boomer.  I'd be a bad debater if I threw a hissy fit because I got called a word I didn't like.  >The debate is over and you lost.   Yes, because the party that storms off after denying reality for lofty emotional reasons is the party that won.   Seriously, I really hope you actually do some research as you really sound like a bit of a closeted bigot.",0
I only told you to fuck off because the fact that you were starting the aggression by being condescending and belittling anything I said and any opinion I gave. I was only pointing out my age because the fact that you were treating me as if I was a child who needed to learn things on and subject matter that you probably are only beginning to understand. I wanted to actually educate you just like how you were trying to educate me on something that you didn't understand. So sorry if you didn't like a taste of your own medicine. Oh I'm not storming off by the way understanding the debate and declaring that I won because you lost all relevance by referring to me as a boomer and by going and declaring that my opinion is wrong. The whole point of the debate is to express opinions so say my opinion is wrong automatically makes you the loser in this debate because you cannot accept my opinion was different than yours. Actually I'm not a closeted bigoted. If anything you sound like a closeted bigoted to anyone that doesn't share the exact same opinion as you. That makes you sound like an absolute of fascist and I have to have the exact same level of empathy as you. One model of empathy is probably much stronger than yours because I can actually understand the fact that other people have different opinions than my own I'm going to accept that but I won't go and claim other people's opinions are raw. That's the beauty of football freestyle. As someone that should be supposedly open-minded you should understand that level of expression. Unless you want to say that I'm wrong and continue to show your narrow-minded view on what all right opinion is versus the wrong opinion. Which by the way is a very narrow-minded bigoted mindset.,1
">I only told you to fuck off because the fact that you were starting the aggression by being condescending and belittling anything I said and any opinion I gave.  But still, telling me to fuck off is pretty childish. Or we can be grown adults and not get mad when someone calls is a word we don't like.   >I was only pointing out my age because the fact that you were treating me as if I was a child who needed to learn things on and subject matter that you probably are only beginning to understand.   You clearly do need to be educated on the matter as you believe the opposite of what the evidence says. That's why I say your opinion is wrong, because it ignores reality by ignoring evidence.   If you actually did the research you would know that positive representation does help as simply googling ""the effects of representation"" comes up with dozens of studies that you can read.   >I wanted to actually educate you just like how you were trying to educate me on something that you didn't understand.   What about it do I not understand? If you are truly trying to educate me, please explain where I am wrong on this, please explain to me how positive representation is actually harmful?  >Oh I'm not storming off by the way understanding the debate and declaring that I won because you lost all relevance by referring to me as a boomer and by going and declaring that my opinion is wrong.   You disregarded my points and claimed you had won because I called you a word you didn't like.   How is calling your opinion wrong, wrong? Opinions are informed by evidence, and if your opinion is not backed by evidence, it's wrong.   Is the opinion that the earth is flat, wrong? Please tell me.    >so say my opinion is wrong automatically makes you the loser in this debate because you cannot accept my opinion was different than yours.  I can accept opinions that are different to me, as long as they are backed up by evidence, again, I'm not going to accept someone's opinion that vaccines cause autism because it is demonstrably true that they don't. Just like it's demonstrable that positive representation is a good thing.   Can you please show me why it's not a good thing?  >Actually I'm not a closeted bigoted.  Says the person who uses bigoted talking points like ""forced diversity""  >If anything you sound like a closeted bigoted to anyone that doesn't share the exact same opinion as you.  That's not being bigoted, I am open minded, I'm not intolerant of you simply because you hold a different belief to my own, but that doesn't mean I have to accept or respect your opinion as it's not based on evidence.   >That makes you sound like an absolute of fascist   Thanks for calling me a fascist, you clearly don't understand what that word means.   >because I can actually understand the fact that other people have different opinions than my own  I know people have different opinions than my own. Some are wrong because they're not backed by evidence. And some are purely subjective, like the quality of art.   >Unless you want to say that I'm wrong and continue to show your narrow-minded view on what all right opinion is versus the wrong opinion  You are wrong because your opinion doesn't hold up to scrutiny, you don't have any evidence for your opinions outside of lofty emotional reasons.   >Which by the way is a very narrow-minded bigoted mindset.  It's not, being open minded means that you are willing to change your beliefs and opinions when given good reason to do so.",0
You're getting waaaaaay too ahead of yourself!,3
"We just got a standalone *Joker* film with no solid information regarding the status of Leto's version. We're also getting a new Batman film series with a hype cast and no indication of how it will connect with other films, if at all.  Yeah, I think we'll be okay.",3
"No. General audiences aren't high on Batfleck. I know most people here loved him, but it's the truth. The box office performance of his two movies should be an indicator. There was a poll done (an actual scientific poll) conducted by THR and Morning Consultant, where his Batman came in last place among all portrayals. This is bad, considering that he is the most recent Batman and recency bias alone should have saw him finish higher. [Here is a link, it's a good read.](https://morningconsult.com/2019/06/18/as-pattinson-answers-bat-signal-bale-and-keaton-top-fan-favorites/)  > Among the different Caped Crusaders, Christian Bale of the ‚ÄúDark Knight‚Äù trilogy and Michael Keaton of ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù and ‚ÄúBatman Returns‚Äù were the most favored Batman actors with a net favorability of 60 points and 59 points, respectively. **Ben Affleck‚Äôs portrayal of Batman in 2016‚Äôs ‚ÄúBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice‚Äù and 2017‚Äôs ‚ÄúJustice League‚Äù had the lowest net favorability at 18 points**.",2
"Batfleck DCEU faithful fan here. I‚Äôll be happy to move on to Reeves‚Äô version. The more iterations of these characters, the better. You get to see different takes and the creative process from these talented individuals. I just want to see the Snyder Cut.",2
">Won‚Äôt a lot of vocal fans just beg for a full Affleck ‚ÄúThe Batman‚Äù movie? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts about this DC faithful.   They shouldn't as playing batman was clearly a strain on Afflecks mental health, even before JL's reshoots. He's also said that he wasn't able to crack the script.   I'd love an Affleck solo movie, but it just wasn't meant to be unfortunately",1
It will have the same effect that the Nolan films not starring Keaton did: none.,1
What fans demand at this point for Ben‚Äôs Batman is irrelevant. It‚Äôs best if they just start getting used to Pattinson.,2
"It doesn't matter because the SnYdEr CuT will not be released anytime soon if ever, and no amount of Twitter hashtags will change that.",1
"It shouldnt be a problem considering pattinson is a better actor than Affleck and has a larger fan base,plus affleck isnt that popular with general audiences, THR did a survey with people most beloved batman and affleck was at the bottom, he is nowhere as popular as keaton or bale in the role, if the batman is good pattinson will already be more popular than him",1
Yes. That's what I am wondering and I am beginning to wonder if the anti Snyder cut stuff is some infighting style from other directors working on their projects. People that haven't worked with Zack.,0
That's one of the reasons I think the Snyder Cut is not going to be released. Because it's going to complicate things unnecessarily for all other directors that work on DC projects right now.,0
"Difference is, that movie was successful and they didnt cut down a bunch of scenes of Joaquins Joker. They did that with Leto who was then criticized for not being a good Joker. Ben was critically lauded as Batman by most people and even the detractors leading to people being upset when Ben was rumored to leave and then announced it. Just saying",0
"Right. I don‚Äôt consider Affleck the gold standard now. The GA probably doesn‚Äôt too. Bale is the most recent Batman they remember, I think Pattinson is safe.",2
What is a small demographic of people that they were using. Specifically within an age range that were mostly associated or Flan's of those particular versions. They didn't get a wider demographic during that poll. It's widely considered by many people that bat Fleck is one of the top Batman. That pull your siding is just of a small narrow demographic of people when it's not actually fully representing the wide demographic of people that I've seen Batman movies. They only one with certain age ranges. Because if you remember when people had to choose between Nicholas Hoult or Robert Pattinson people chose Robert Pattinson but was within a certain age range to. If you do a wider variety of people most people are going to go with that Ben Affleck,0
Good perspective I just can‚Äôt imagine the open ended nature of Darkseid and the Apokolips future/flash back follow up film will be something fans can ignore easily.,0
I think what he's getting at is the fact that the fans are the ones that do watch these movies in a fan interest is being shown for one product and not the other that's something that needs to be addressed or at least look that because at the end of the day you want to make sure you guarantee a certain group of people to go and see your movie cuz otherwise if you can't even get the demographic of people that are most likely to watch a film then you're screwed.,0
Never Say Never.,1
This. I honestly think WB has always profited so much off of Batman on film it really hurts them to show how bad ass Snyder continued his take on Affleck‚Äôs Batman and weakens the interest of the hardcore fans in Pattinson when Ben could‚Äôve stayed for many more appearances.,0
How could it not. Of course WB has proven they don‚Äôt need to only focus DC large connected big budget epics...but if the Snyder Cut shows a very great large scale beginning to the Justice League then the fan outcry alone would be nearly impossible to ignore from a business stand point.,1
"Exactly. The guy arguing with me is in denial of that. Batfleck is clearly not the most remembered big screen Batman, which is bad because he was the most recent. People should remember him more, almost by default. The fact that Bale and Keaton are more remembered/highly regarded should tell you everything you need to know.",2
"The poll was of 2,201 U.S. adults. That's not a ""small demographic"" of people at all. That's a standard size sample, that is used for political polling all the time.  Also you are straight up making things up lol. The poll results are literally broken down by age range. Batfleck came in last place among all age groups. He came only one point ahead of Clooney among young people, age 18 to 29.",2
This is absolutely true and I can see that being an issue with some fans. Who knows what the future will hold if the Snyder Cut actually does come out and is reviewed more favorably than the version we got?,1
">I think what he's getting at is the fact that the fans are the ones that do watch these movies  No, general audiences watch them, some of whom happen to be fans. Fans have not nor have they ever been the driving box office force for superhero movies.",1
"Exactly and the more we see form the Snyder cut and his version of Batman again, the less relevant that Pattinson becomes. I mean, Ben tweeted just one thing saying release the Snyder cut and it has almost 6 thousand people replying to it. If you combine all of Reeves recent tweets and casting reveals, all the comments wouldn't be close.",1
">Of course WB has proven they don‚Äôt need to only focus DC large connected big budget epics  They are making low budget films like Joker but also Aquaman 2, Wonder Woman 1984, New Gods, Black Adam and (hopefully) Flash. All these films are big budget films that are going to expand to universe much more than the Snyder's cut.",1
Bale had 3 standalone Batman films and Keaton had 2. Ben Affleck had none.,1
Anyway being the most remembered doesn‚Äôt exactly have anything to do with how accurate or good his performance was.,1
"I was happy for Affleck's casting, even before seeing his Batman, mainly because, we have  an American Bruce Wayne again, thank god. But that's his biggest plus, for me.",1
"Small demographic. Comparative to the hundreds of thousands of people that enjoyed Batman on BvS, regardless of if they liked the movie or not. That's how strong his batman was. Considered the best.",0
That's a total lie.,0
"Batfleck has fans of his iteration. Battinson only has fans that are excited based on concept, when his film comes out there will new be people who are fans of his batman as well. Pattinson will be more than fine, hes the future of DC films batman, Batfleck is the past (with the possible exception of snyder cut but that's set in the past as well). Also you're counting comments, which is gonna be skewed because so many of the comments of afflecks post as releasethesnydercut  hashtags repeats over and over.",1
"You doing the equivalent of ""na na na na boo boo, I can't hear you"" right now. You keep claiming things are not what they are, simply because it's not what you want to believe.   > Comparative to the hundreds of thousands of people that enjoyed Batman on BvS  Yes, because hundreds of thousands of people did not enjoy the Dark Knight or Dark Knight Rises. C'mon man. And the Keaton Batman films are iconic, and both set box office records when they were released.   I understand that you love Batfleck, but you are in denial about how other people perceive the character, and you're also in denial about how people perceive the prior Batmen, clearly.",1
"No, it isn't. Comic book fans are a small sliver of the general audience. Movies that gross over a billion dollars at the box office don't do so because of ""fans,"" they do so because they appealed to the broadest cross section of people possible.",1
"Can't believe this guy is trying to compare Affleck's (an A-list celeb) twitter to Matt Reeves. Reeves is a director who barely anybody outside of hardcore fans know, while Affleck is a mainstream, popular celeb with 3 million followers, lol. Reeve's has less than 100,000 followers. Not really sure what his point is.",1
False to everything you have said.,0
Nope totally misunderstanding my words.,0
"As well as the people that do repeat viewings, most of which are the fans of the franchise or series.",0
"He doesn't have a valid point or the one hes trying to make is completely skewed and biased and when I addressed that, he hit me up with the equivalent of ""K"" at the end of the text message",1
"Hmmm interesting response there, I can really see where you're coming from. I'm glad you expressed you're viewpoints in a way that took mine into consideration and allows for a further conversation.",1
"Or people who just liked the movie enough to see it multiple times, lol. In fact, if you're talking solely about the fans deciding the fate of the new Batman (they won't), Batfleck is not a good example anyway since BVS and Justice League both underperformed at the box office (with the former having very poor legs).   If we're talking pure dollars and cents, both Batman 89 and the two Nolan sequels were much more popular with ""the fans"" by that logic.",1
Better to get straight to the point,0
"No, its actually better to get to the point and expand to have a conversation. But you're either incapable of it or can't be bothered, so feel free to not waste my time replying with nonsense again. Also you were 'straight to point' yet your point was objectively wrong. Because what I said can't be ""false"" to everything since half of it was literal facts.",1
"Facts hurt, I guess.",2
"No. Everything you said wasn't facts. Pattinson is only popular because he's grabbing a certain demographic of people that will only fade away and won't have the longevity of following a series like the comic book fans that actually follow the series and who are the majority of people that are driving these sales. Also Ben Affleck is considered a very accurate and if not one of the best Batman interpretations of all time so you already setting a high standard there plus we were led to believe that we were going to continuation of that Batman only till recently to learn that Warner Brothers had been lying to us for 2 years when we originally were kind of left in the dark about the situation. So you've already have a split fan base cuz people are still fresh off of the batfleck train and that series of him hasn't been resolved and now we're expected to all the time Jump on another Batman reboot? Now you're only getting a small Art House demographic of people that enjoy those kind of movies as well as Pattinson the movies like the pseudo-intellectuals that think they know everything or actual fans of Batman in actuality they're not going to be interested in the long run like people that actually enjoy these franchises and go further with a character as well as the comic book fans who are also the ones that follow these franchises. Most of these people are either the trendy Twitter crowd that only listen to the latest and greatest movie and since Pattinson is a young popular actor right now and it's scored beeff points especially with the art house crowd, he's the demographic they're looking for where in actuality he really doesn't have the legs to carry out a franchise. He's also not even sure how long he's going to be even doing these movies. They're hoping that with a society of Joker that they can go and make every movie a non comic book style pseudo intellectual Arts house style of comic book movies and go back to the Nolan are of movies where the Mystique and even Mythic characters and yes even Batman's world is now sucked away because they want to create this semi overtly realistic version of a fake fictional Fantastical comic book character",0
"No. Your facts are inaccurate. The only accurate thing is that Batman 89, adjusted for inflation, has made more money. You dont release that BvS has made a profit and has made more money from DvD and Bluray sales alone then Aquaman. Fans carry the interest.",0
">No. Everything you said wasn't facts.  I didnt say everything. I said ""half"". I used that word because I originally gave facts and my opinions and you said ""false to everything"". You completely read that wrong. Everything I said can't be wrong because it included facts like my very first statement: ""Batfleck has fans of his iteration"", and they also included my opinion, which are what you are free to disagree with. Thanks for the wall of text with your stance on it but you've very much soured this conversation with your immediate dismissive attitude at the start of it. So its not going to be something I'm interested in continuing. Have a god day/ night",1
"> Your facts are inaccurate.  They are not. Everything I just stated is verifiable. Like I said, either fans don't carry the audience for these films, or BVS's underperformance at the box office suggests that ""the fans"" aren't all that crazy about Affleck's Batman being the bestest ever if it came in well below the Keaton and Bale versions in terms of ticket sales.  That's the whole problem here. You personally love BVS and Affleck's portrayal of Batman, which is fine, but you're massively exaggerating how invested in it the majority of the audience is.   As I said before: if the Batman could successfully continue despite much more popular and positively received entries eventually giving way to new actors, there's literally no reason to think that won't happen for a new Batman. Again, this is a fact that is verifiable by looking at the box office history of the franchise.",1
"Actually I was not dismissive, only when you began insulting my stance on the situation as well as peoples preferences for something versus something else. Sorry, nice try. Have a nice day!",1
I've exaggerated nothing and you clearly misunderstood my point about fans carry the franchise through consistency and relevance. So I will end this conversation. You clearly underestimate the points I am making.,0
>only when you began insulting my stance on the situation as well as peoples preferences for something versus something else    Show me proof of this please. Where is the insult? Don't go around making accusation.,1
"> I've exaggerated nothing   Sure you have, because I just stated why using facts and figures to illustrate it. The entire premise of your argument is flawed. If fans truly carry the franchises then that means nothing about Affleck's films having a negative impact on Pattinson's since, as I already stated, despite the claim that Ben is the most popular Batman ever, his movies made considerably less at the box office (not even counting poor reviews) than Keaton's first film or Bale's second and third.   Like I said, it's fine if you like Ben. I like him and feel he got a bum deal. But to pretend he's some sort of mega-popular portrayal that will kill the new Batman in its cradle because audiences won't accept anyone else in the role is an utter fantasy and not supported by the actual evidence we have on hand.",1
By saying multiple times that I am sour about batfleck not being batman and that I an in denial. Very rude and inaccurate.,1
Inaccurate.,0
"Incorrect again. Show me proof. Don't make up fake statements. Quote me any part of my original comment to you where I insulted you. Take as long as you need to realise I didnt. You were dismissive in you're very first response to me where you said "" false to everything you said"" with no further explanation. So please find the proof in my original comment of me insulting you",0
"Accurate. In fact, I'm confident enough to say that the new Batman movie will outgross BVS and Justice League if the reviews and word of mouth are good.",1
That is not true.,0
"Maybe Justice League. Not BVS. But I could be wrong. Reboot is too soon man. Also, unnecessary.",0
"Find proof and change your name to ""lieandjusticeUSA"", whilst you're at it.",1
"It will. If it has good word of mouth, it'll have strong repeat viewing (which is what ultimately chopped off BVS' legs). And given the director's critical track record, it'll likely be well received.",1
I am only speak Truth and Justice and you decide to twist my words and convey that I have lied. That is not justice me friend. Take a step back.,1
"I don't think it will. Probably won't. I could be wrong but probably wont. Keep in mind a fee of Matt Reeves movie scores have gotten C's on cinema score. Lower than any of Zack's Films. Plus, I've seen his stuff, he is not exactly the best director.",0
Show me proof.,1
"Probably will. Reeves is an acclaimed director. This'll be a big hit, and like I already showed using evidence, Batfleck won't harm the film.",1
"My opinion is my opinion, so that is me being truthful to myself. And your is your opinion so it is truthful to yourself. To claim that I am sour about this and in denial is a blatant lie and not true to how I am expressing my opinions.",1
Your evidence is inaccurate and a false one sided view. Reeves had a few lucky hits but he is an overrated director who can't stay relevant beyond the initial month of the release of his movies.,0
"False again. You said I insulted you, so give me proof. Where are the quotes. Where did I say you were sour or in denial in my original post. It's less then 100 words, should be easy to find.",1
"I love you trying to counter evidence by claiming it's an opinion by responding with an opinion, lol.  That's the good thing about facts, though. They don't care about bias!  So as I said, betting right now: this will do better than BVS because most of the audience has already moved on. We shall see. Oh, this will be fun come the launch!",1
"If you can't look at your own comments and see when you did that, then I feel sorry for your self awareness. I am giving you examples of what you said and you refuse to listen.",1
I'm not being biased. And there are facts that refute your claims too. So don't go and spout off facts when you you're only looking at the one end of it all.,0
"I feel sorry for your inability to admit when you've been exposed as a moron, yet here we are with your accusations and inability to prove me wrong whatsoever. I guess weve both got things to be sorry for",1
"> I'm not being biased.  Yes, you are. That's the crux of your entire argument. But not to worry! Like I said, we will have definitive proof of who is right come the opening! Fun fun fun!  RemindMe! to revisit this bet in 2021!",1
You literally said I was in denial. You can't deny that. I think you are the one in denial. I am sorry for thinking you could have a rational conversation.,0

True and same with you too btw on being biased. And yes we will see.,0
"I'm surprised you didnt get the role in the new Joker film, you've got the clown act nailed perfectly",1
"Oh, I'm not. That's why I've used facts. But like I said, this will be born out by more facts in the end, so it's moot. And Remind Me Bot has been activated.   Here. We. Go!",1
I'm surprise you didn't get the role of Lex Luthor because you're good at bullshitting your way through a conversation.,0
"Oh you are too because you are only using facts on one side. As am I, i use facts as well. So clearly we will have to wait and see.",0
Nope. Facts be facts. And we shall! Fun!,1
"Oh, and before you respond, I shall be blocking/muting you now. But I will undo it come the big day in 2021. See ya then!",1
"It could be possible than WB are moving TSS to some point towards the end of 2020, maybe a new release date could be announced at CCXP?, filming will be over in around a month, it's not vfx heavy movie so between finishing filming and the current release date is around 20 months, it's possible WB and Gunn decided to move it to something like October 2020 so Gunn can then go and make GOTG3.",3
There‚Äôs a full on WB panel before the Wonder Woman one so crossing fingers.,3
Senpai noticed me!... I'll see myself out.,2
"If they present anything, it would be nice if it was just a photo. I'm not expecting a teaser or footage of any sort just yet, but something similar to the first photo of the whole squad from David Ayer's Suicide Squad would be really cool. It would be awesome to see everyone in costume together finally.",2
ih rapaz. Last time he was at CCXP he freaked out with the crowd. No surprise if he wants to show something so much,1
Joker had a make up test clip. Birds of Prey had a smal  clip featuring all actors in their costumes.  I hope we get one similar to BoP with actors in their costumes.,0
"I love your idea my friend, Gunn said Suicide Squad will be finished for february 2020 but I don't think they will move it, he said we cannot expect a trailer for a year or more, so end of 2020 for a trailer, confirming the 2021 release",2
Yeah it's what I think too,1
"Yeah I don't expect a teaser but a photo of the cast in costume will be really cool, and this will help to build the anticipation for the movie",1
I hope too but why do we have nothing at this time ? The shooting has started in september.,1
Isn't The Batman suit going to be revealed too?,1
"This isn't an official poster is it? I've never seen it called ""Zack Snyder's Justice League""",3
Great poster.  It's just missing Green Lantern and Shazam,3
This should be the Snyder Cut Blu-ray cover if it ever gets released,3
This poster was one of if not the only good thing to come out of JL,3
"I am sorry to bum you out...but as much as I would like this pic in 4K, the conversion of low res pics to higher res does not usually give you the desired result. Mostly, the algorithm is just converting nearby pixels to form a bloated image and the result is far from perfect.",3
You could use the letsenhance.io website,1
I just wish this poster was less orange and looked more like Snyder's color palate,1
Well I have some of the original photoshop files for the chinese marketing campaign so I can try make one later.,1
"This should help: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKHpEZ6WsAAvuIo?format=jpg&name=4096x4096](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKHpEZ6WsAAvuIo?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)  Try [yandex](https://yandex.com/images/search?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FEFzsnoSXUAAR-7l.jpg&text=justice%20league%20with%20superman&rpt=imageview&cbir_id=1586165%2FnoMi7HSm7Fe-hii2LoOeTA) to search for images, since google images sux now.",2
THIS close to perfection...,1
I've said it before and I'll say it again. That flash suit would be so much better without the wires going around it.,1
They all look so dope in this pic!,1
The Snyder above the title is very lame. The Justice League doesn‚Äôt need any director to be above there name.,0
"those costumes look so horrible. Maybe batman and superman are okay, but everyone else especially flash, looks like their cgi was done by a child",0
The poster itself is official but the ‚ÄúZack Snyder‚Äôs‚Äù was added in,3
I don't believe so. I'd never seen that either.,2
"It‚Äôs all fan made, no official poster for Justice League ever had that particular layout",2
I imagine they would have been there in the sequel if things went as planned..üò≠,3
this is my blu ray cover already. minus the zach snyder name on it. special edition that was sold here in germany,2
I'd definitely be cool with that üëå,1
Agreed! I actually never saw this exact version until a few days ago on Twitter.,2
And the 'Heroes' trailer. It is my fav part about the movie.,1
"I specifically was about to type this, best thing to ever come of the film",1
"You did it in a nice way, so I appreciate that üòÅü§ô",2
"Ah crap üò£ Well, you bummed me out!",1
Holy shit! That worked wonderfully. Thanks so much for your help!,1
That'd be awesome!,1
"I mean, I like the Donner Cut logo with his name.",1
To each their own...,1
I got a copy in NZ as well,1
In iceland? That's where aquaman was hanging out in the bar.  So there was another extended fight scene?,3
[Source](https://twitter.com/bigmonkeyluvr25/status/1198357299972075522?s=21),3
Y'all remember that epic chase sequence with the Amazons?  We would have gotten the same thing but with Atlanteans.  :(,3
It‚Äôs just incredible to see the amount of stuff that was cut.,3
I hate to say it... but I think I prefer the Snyder Atlantean armour to the Aquaman Atlantean armour.,3
This all HAS to mean something.           My head is going to fucking explode when it's officially announced.,3
This is all so damn juicy,2
I like to think that one day all this unused footage will be repurposed for a future movie.,1
"What the fuck, WB? Why did they fuck it all up?",3
"The entire Atlantian part of the film was trimmed. Like Steppenwolf invading Themascyria, he would have invaded Atlantis the same way. The theatrical cut even has dead Parademons floating in the water, a remnant of this cut plot point, even though only Steppenwolf invades.  It shows why they were so defensive of the Mother Box, they had already warded off an invasion, one that caused the fisherman to get attacked and made Aquaman go to Atlantis in the first place.  Strange that Whedon reshot part of the scene so Aquaman would find the green slime, yet cut out the Parademon invasion that literally caused it.  A pre-viz even features Mera using her water absorbing technique on a BvS-era Steppenwolf model which would have contrasted with her using the ability to help in the Aquaman solo.",3
Zack: So remember that epic sequence with the Amazons? Let's fucking do that underwater!,3
"I actually wonder if the Troops guarding the mother box were from Xebel. They have the same gold armor as the soldiers here, and it kind of makes sense that Mera would have been leading them, since she is their princess, and she wasn‚Äôt married to Orm at the time.",3
It's Xebellian armor. You can see it in Aquaman.  The white armor is mainstream Atlantean military armor.,3
Why do you hate to say it...,3
"I didn't like the white plastic Apple product look the Atlantean troopers had. Plastic armors are the norm in CBMs, but they seldom look so obviously plastic.",3
"When the Snydercut comes out, if the Atlanteans don't enter the scene with an explosion then I'm gonna take the Aquaman atlanteans over JL.",2
"More of a rustic artisan look, more realistic. The newer films have all but gone away with that.",2
"Snyder bowed out after his daughter's tragedy, then WB brought in Joss Whedon to finish the movie.  He then rewrote it to be as trash as all of his other projects, so blame him, not WB. They had a release date to uphold.",0
"So there are 2 Aquaman in sea sequences?  - One with saving the Mariner.  - The other one where he joins the fight against Steppenwolf, couldn't stop him and talks to Mera.   Or is it a continuous sequence?  - Arthur saving the Mariner from Parademons - Underwater scene where he finds dead bodies of Atlantean guards - Fighting Steppenwolf -Talking to Mera - Bringing the  Mariner to bar, Drinks Vodka and swims to Wayne Hangar?",3
"> It wasn‚Äôt Atlantis. I spoke with Zack [Snyder, director of Justice League,] early on, and Zack mentioned that the location that Aquaman swims to in Justice League is an outpost. So when he told me that was his idea, I was like, 'Oh great, then I can actually have Arthur go to Atlantis for the first time.' That‚Äôs very important for me, because he can go into it and have a wide-eyed approach to Atlantis and be in awe of it. I think that‚Äôs very important from a storytelling standpoint because the audience gets to experience Atlantis for the first time along with the character.",2
He might have reshot the scene before WB's 2 hour mandate.,1
They are xebelians,2
It's confirmed to be an outpost and the armor is that of Xebel   Plus they probably have some ties to whoever the King in the flashbacks was (Was that Atlan?),1
"You have to be cautious when praising Snyder.  Always make sure to add the old *""I know it's just my opinion...""* or *""I understand that most of you disagree...""*.  You have to make sure that other's are aware of how little you think of your own opinion. If you don't others will do it for you.",2
Because that would mean the armor in aquaman was inferior and it was a pretty good movie..,3
"It resembles what guardians of an ancient relic might wear as per tradition, whereas by Aquaman solo they have modern style on the current guards.  The Mother Box location was kept secret, so it's likely a series of families inheriting armour over generations, whereas the rest of Atlantis, like IRL, wear modern tech. It's like the Queen's Guard in the UK. Maybe not the absolute best but you can't beat tradition.",3
"No they did not have a release date to uphold. They could have pushed it back but they wanted to keep the release date so they could get a bonus. So they not only had Whedon screw with Snyder‚Äôs vision, they only gave him a few months. So yes, blame WB.",3
As trash as his other projects? Really? I get not liking his work but that doesn't seem a little irrationally angry to you?,2
> He then rewrote it to be as trash as all of his other projects  His extremely popular and well received projects. I get that popular doesn't always indicate quality but it's not like he's only had a few hits in his career.   WB could have easily pushed the release without issue. Especially with a genuine reason like Snyder's situation.,2
I read that he was being pushed out because WB had given up on his vision. Either way I really wish we got to see it come to fruition.,1
"Maybe two; Arthur is supposed to be receiving coaching from Vulko in secret, setting up Vulko for Aquaman. Either he then goes to the Mother Box to deal with Steppenwolf and the Parademons due to invasion, Vulko staying behind to maintain secrecy, or Aquaman does training and at a later portion saves the diver which prompts him to go to Atlantis.  The dead guards were CGI'd by Whedon over Aquaman finding the dead king, a plot point rewritten by Aquaman solo.  Basically, we likely saw Aquaman training with Vulko separately, something he'd do drunk, and then the Fisherman prompts him to check out Atlantis later on, OR Vulko training gets interrupted by the invasion.",3
So basically my headcanon is right  Nice,1
"That sounds like a good analogy. But there's more. The newer films don a different aesthetic. Compare the underwater scenes in JL to AM. You go from textured/clouded to clear/vibrant. The underwater physics go from more resistance to less resistance. The vibrant modern look isn't just about in-universe uniforms. In the next WW film Diana is about to wear the American flag. It's gone from antique brass to orange to red.  So, there are several things going on here.",2
Interesting.  This is the first time I'm hearing about Vulko training Arthur. I always thought Vulko was reserved for the tail end of film where he accompanies Mera before Arthur rejects them and goes to see his dad.,2
"Well, it was *likely* the plan. Wan did make changes for Aquaman he thought were necessary but did try to respect Snyder.",1
"He was supposed to be training in secret, introducing us to Arthur who hates being Atlantean yet still loves one of his people and wants to learn his own ways, even if he has no direction, just to establish Aquaman's combat training. Then Aquaman would have delved into their past, itself why Arthur sounds so cheery to see Vulko again, we were supposed to have seen them together already.  Since it was cut out, we just assume Aquaman was always a skilled badass until his solo gives us his origin. Snyder had thought to at least show why Aquaman is a fighter, whereas the theatrical cut now makes it seem like he gets trained only when he loses the first fight against Steppenwolf.  Necessary building blocks were shaved off. Ares's original design in WW before it was changed heavily resembles the ancient Ares armour of the 5000 years ago battle. Snyder had *introduced* us with world building but was gonna let the solo directors do their thing. But due to the aversion to Snyder, all of the buildup was changed. Vulko was removed entirely, same with Iris (presumably setting up the Flash movie headed by Rick Famuyiwa).  Basically, #ReleaseTheSnyderCut",2
"Oh without a doubt that was the plan. Kinda hard to hide that fact, lol. And Zack definitely supports James' vision, as he's shown on social media.  I'm not saying one is better than the other here, just merely pointing out the clear aesthetic path the ""new"" DCEU is demonstrably taking.",1
I believe.  And I believe you deserve upvotes!,3
ReleaseTheBoyScoutSuperman,3
You'll believe a man can shave.,2
This is what the next superman movie needs to be,3
"I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised a small group of people don‚Äôt want the ‚ÄúBoy Scout‚Äù Superman back.  To me , the people who say that don‚Äôt get Superman‚Äôs character at all and won‚Äôt care enough to learn about what he stands for. He isn‚Äôt supposed to be gritty and emo. Superman isn‚Äôt designed to be relatable, he‚Äôs supposed to be inspiring. He‚Äôs supposed to be the bright light that inspires people and gives them hope for a better future.",3
Man what I wouldn't have given to see Henry play THIS Superman..,1
Well he's not a man so....,1
"Y0uLl BeLiEvE a MaN cAn FlY  We did, in Man of Steel...  It's as if this wording is trying to suggest Zacks vision never happened. The flight scene composed by Zimmer is one of the greatest scenes in Superhero movie history, so yeah we believe thank you very much.",0
"Do (some) people actually want boyscout Superman back? Why we can‚Äôt me move past the Reeve films? I mean, they were great (the first two and the Donner Cut at least) but those were products of their time, the late 70‚Äôs and early 80‚Äôs.  I understand the darker and serious tone of Man of Steel and BvS wasn‚Äôt for everyone but at least they gave us a new take on the character, even if some/many didn‚Äôt like it.  Besides, we already went to that well with Superman Returns and didn‚Äôt work. Sure, it wasn‚Äôt a bad film but it failed to re-introduce Superman because it was to busy with ‚Äúfamily drama‚Äù and a rehashed plot from the first film.",0
C'mon already JJ!. I need to see him save a cat from a tree!!.,2
Way too bright  MoS was perfect,0
Idk. The ultra bright pastal approach doesn't really work now. A sharper more tempered image seems to be what works.,0
Okay dude... That's great n' all and I love Man of Steel but the wording is a throw back to the original superman poster from 1978. https://i.imgur.com/W9g7KVR.jpg,2
"boyscout =/= Reeves movies.         I recommend either the Superman comics post Infinite Crisis or the Rebirth era, where it shows how he can still be a boyscout and be interesting and modern",3
Lots of trees in Metropolis. Know what that means? Lots of cats in those trees.,1
Lol do you even superman bro? He's supposed to be bright.,3
really wasn't. I really like MoS but I always thought that movie was needlessly dark in terms of the coloring.,2
MoS was cold and lifeless.,0
I wouldn't call this pastel. It's just vibrant. The new Star Trek movies are bright like this and nobody complains that they should be greyer. Can his costume be the same color blue as Spok's shirt?,2
Says who? I bet a movie like that will be better recieved by critics and fans than Snyder‚Äôs movies.,2
I get that and I‚Äôd love what you‚Äôre saying. But a considerable percentage of movie-goers don‚Äôt read comics but do relate Superman to Christopher Reeve.,0
Oh em gee!!. A true DC fan can only hope for this!.,1
It's not like he gets power from the sun or anything /s,2
Read the comics bro!  This poster looks like this shit movie superman returns.   MoS was perfect,1
"Idk, I'd say Into Darkness is still closer to MoS than this, which just looks overly bright. Hell, even Donner's Superman feels less distractingly bright than this picture (Mainly because it has a softer image. Which I personally wouldn't be against, but after people raged about the 4K release of Superman 1 being too soft and grainy I don't think it'll be well received). Honestly I had no problem with MoS' palette, it had a nice range from darks to lights. It actually looked like a real city rather than the overly lit green screen New York Avengers 1 had (Which is why I'm glad the Russo movies have a more tempered palette similar to MoS).",0
"From a visual standpoint, the softer pastel style just doesn't jive with modern generations. The 4K release of Superman 1 got criticized a ton for it, even though that was always part of the movie. Higher resolutions just don't do softer images any favors. And when you use ultra bright colors in a sharper movie, you get Neon Garbage like Josstice League.  The visuals weren't what people disliked about MoS and BvS, hell the visuals are the most praised parts of them. Just adding brighter colors wouldn't make people like the movies more. Hell, look at most of the Russo Marvel movies. They aren't hyper bright for the most part, they have very similar colors to MoS (BvS happens to mostly take place at night so that's irrelevant).  Suggesting that you can make people like it more just by turning up brightness is ridiculous. The problem people had with MoS is simply that the timing was horrible for a slow-building deconstructionist Post-Crisis approach to Superman, and BvS' problems with the GA were mostly from the awful Theatrical Cut. Am I saying the GA was wrong for the former? Not really. I'll swallow my pride and say that with how sick of the 2000s edgy CBMs people were at that point, a darker take on Superman never would be accepted (Even though MoS is better than 90% of those 2000s edgefests). Thing is, that would've ended by JL anyways, that was the whole point. If they had just stuck to their guns for JL, changing some things AFTER that movie to a different general direction, it would've flowed much better since Superman was always being built to be more optimistic. It's the Classical Greek Hero's Journey:  Challenging Beginning - Ultimate Test - Death (Sometimes Metaphorical, in this case literal) - Rebirth (Ditto) - Optimism brought to the land. But we didn't get any optimism. We got cringe. Death is itchy apparently. Ugh.",0
I‚Äôm saying that the source material itself shows him as a boyscout-ish character and shows that this can and does work in modern day Superman stories,3
The best thing is Cavill wants this....,1
And the worst thing is that alot of people will not go and watch that....,1
Actually I think it did change how big budget movies are made. Everything (besides actual superheroes) is trying to be Dark Knight now.,2
"Poor Rob. You made the mistake of assuming that everyone who has access to a multi-million dollar tentpole is really deserving of such a vast, rewarding opportunity.",0
Not saying you're wrong but what are some things you'd say are trying to be Dark Knight?,1
This was years ago though so his opinion and mindset has probably changed,1
"Phrased that a little poorly, I mean tonally. Lots of movies have taken on gritty forms post-Nolan.  Man of Steel and Robin Hood 2018 were what immediately came to mind.",1
You're good I didnt mean to sound like I was interrogating you haha.  But you're right that robin hood wanted to be batman haha. I remember amazing spider-man felt like it was trying to be grittier as well.,1
Amazing Spider-Man is a great example. Not so much TASM2 though.,1
Hollywood hates gingers.,3
"How about Erin Kellyman? She played Enfys Nest (The pirate lord revealed to be a biracial ginger girl) in Solo: A Starwars Story. She played a convincing badass, could pass for Jeffrey wrights daughter and is a ginger.",2
Not a bad pick in any way.,3
I'd kinda prefer anyone else but her if I'm being honest. And no this isn't about hating her. Its just she appears like shes the go to black girl in Hollywood. Its not her fault but I would want someone else to be given a chance.,3
Jane Levy should be Batgirl,3
She'd be great,1
Why can we just have an original comic book looking character be casted for her :(,3
"Good pick! Just dye her hair red. There are red-headed black people, you know.",1
"Although I'd personally prefer a redhead, I'll trust whoever Reeves casts to do a fine job.",2
üòë,1
Helena Howard if his daughter. Elle Fanning if Niece.,1
I would have Jim Gordon having a vasectomy for opening scene.,0
They already hired someone who is likely his daughter.,0
Amandla Stenberg is wonderful in T.H.U.G. She would be fantastic.,0
Yeah fuck gingers.,0
Seriously. Who‚Äôs cereal did they piss in to get replaced so much like this? It definitely feels like it‚Äôs being done on purpose at this point. What is it about redheads that make Hollywood go ‚ÄúFuck that noise! He/she NEEDS to be black!‚Äù,3
Not when Grace Randolph‚Äôs arch nemesis has been cast in like every movie since 2015.,0
"Me too ,I don‚Äôt hate her either but for Barbara Gordon she is an awful pick",1
I mean if James Gordon is black it‚Äôs kind of hard for her to be a ginger.,3
Hollywood hates redheads apparently.,1
"Lol ,I agree",0
"No, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs an original character. That‚Äôs what i09 and IGN say anyway. Plus, there‚Äôs not really any reason to keep a character like Barbra Gordon under wraps and I don‚Äôt think Reeves would want to ‚Äúre-invent‚Äù a character that‚Äôs on been on the big screen I think once in a shitty movie.  Black girl does not equal BatGirl (you know it‚Äôs true, because it rhymes)  Unless your saying she‚Äôs is an original daughter character for Gordon who isn‚Äôt Barbra",2
It's becoming a fucking circus at this point. First Starfire (Titans) & now Babs lmao  PS: Casting a Latina as Starfire would've been more than acceptable.,1
You know what‚Äôs disgusting right now?  **You.**,3
I assume you've had the same repulsed reaction to every casting of Alfred so far.,2
Why‚Äôs it disgusting?,2
"Well its not impossible though. I knew a guy, mother white father black, he was pale as the moon, frackles and red hair. He had many defining features of his father for sure, but well,  pigment disorder  is  pigment disorder",3
"I more so meant overall looking like the character but none the less if it has to suit Jim Gordan, Starfire from titans, although her hair is dyed it looks pretty real.",1
"Two words: ""I'm adopted.""",1
Adoption and biracial are a thing you know...,1
"No, I09 and IGN are just speculating based on nothing but assumption. There are 1,000 reasons to keep it under wraps. She's a new actor without much experience and they don't want to reveal the inner working of the film yet as it's still far away.",0
You know who can‚Äôt stand a person having his own opinions?  You.,0
"No,alfreds casting is weird,Gordon is horrible,this is disgustingly bad",0
Deadline or whoever broke who shes playing and its not Babs,2
"Nope. You don‚Äôt have to approve of this suggestion, or even of casting a black/mixed Batgirl, but how you present your so called ‚Äúopinions‚Äù matter.   And you presented yours in a disgusting way. So you‚Äôre being disgusting.",2
Racism isn't an *opinion* that gets a seat at the table.,1
You're pathetic dude.,2
Sucks for you then I guess. :p,3
Fuck outta here champ,2
"With some civility, perhaps.   But it appears that whole concept is lost on you.",2
Because your opinions are racist and u need to be open to to new things. I do apologise for my harsh language,1
How ? Write the comment that should I wrote with civility,1
"I don‚Äôt get paid to teach you some basic human decency, so no",2
"In my opinion,the casting is disgusting-I didn‚Äôt said anything else",0
Never even considered him for it. But he'd be an awesome Jay Garrick. Sign me up. He's probably the best actor alive right now and could pull it off easily.,3
Run.. Forrest.. Run!,3
Tom Hanks playing the coolest old guy ever? I'd be here for it.,3
Either as Jay Garrick or Kent Nelson. I just want him as a superhero!,3
Idk I think Bruce Campbell would make a good Jay Garrick. I'd rather see Tom Hanks as Kingdom Come Hal Jordan,3
"I‚Äôd be down. Truthfully, I‚Äôd love to have Tom Hanks anywhere in the DCEU.",3
This would be godly !,2
Wasn‚Äôt that a rumor once that Tom Hanks was going to play Lex Luthor before Jesse Eisenberg a few years back?,2
"The man is probably the greatest actor alive right now, and he‚Äôs been wanting to be a superhero for a while.   This would be the best role to give at his age.   (Though I really want Bruce Greenwood for Jay, you can‚Äôt turn down the Hanks)",2
Jay Garrick is one of those characters gives that feeling of the golden age of comics. That feeling you get when you look at an Alex Ross portrait of the league. Tom Hanks could help bring that to the character in live action,2
I never knew I wanted this so bad until this very moment.,2
I'm actually down for that,2
Ooooooh shit. Maybe better than my dream of George Clooney.,2
Always thought Ted Danson would be s great choice.,1
"He would be cool but I would love any Jay Garrick roles to be filled by the one from the flash, he is so perfect and the og flash.",1
Bloody Awesome. Ed Norton for Thawne?,1
Been my fan cast since 2016,1
Should have been Lex Luthor!,1
Bruce Campbell comes to mind for me,1
"Idk if I‚Äôd be able to get the woody voice outta my head if he was Jay I feel like he‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lightning in my boot!‚Äù",1
Which comic is the comic panel from?,1
Had the same exact thought!,1
He‚Äôs actually said he wants a superhero role too (not a Nick Fury or Alfred type but an actual hero) but no one has offered him anything. Jay Garrick would be so perfect for him.,3
"I might be imagining things, but I feel like in an interview, he actually said he‚Äôd like to be The Flash... which was funny because there are references to The Flash in his movie Catch Me if You Can.",3
Didn‚Äôt know I needed it until I saw it. He‚Äôs perfect!,2
"""The night Superman died, it went off like Christmas"" ... because Lex told Apokolips Earth had no defenders, likely, ergo the movie would show us another POV of the ending. I bet anything Lex witnessed Supes death or had a way of knowing.  I remember, the new 52 launched with Lex in cahoots with Brainiac. I was of the opinion opening night that Lex got an in with Apokolips, opened the door and wanted to be cushy in a cell away from the mess. In doing so, Lex orchestrates Supes death, triggers Batman's quest to find defenders and ultimately, breaks out of prison when his plan succeeded. He takes out multiple threats, earns catharsis, and is in zero fear of danger.  The only hitch? Batman sent him to Arkham, a broken down shithole, ergo in the Snyder Cut, Lex likely hired Deathstroke as payback; thus, the Batman v Deathstroke premise of Batfleck Solo... but the changing of Snyder's story as well as Batman's in SS and JL, meant there was no way to tie into Affleck's passion project. Affleck likely stepped down because he knew the build up to his Batman's greatest outing had its groundwork rewritten and reshot for the Legion of Doom.",3
"Great way to open it, I think. A couple more shots of a grieving world wouldn‚Äôt hurt either.",3
Well that does seem reasonable.,3
"I hate articles like this. Unless I‚Äôm missing something there is no rumour here, it‚Äôs all just conjecture.   > A potential moment of Superman's sacrifice transitioning to scene of Steppenwolf letting Darkseid know that time to strike is now would be an epic, and thematically concise way to continue the Zack Snyder DC saga.",3
Of course it does it‚Äôs all caught on some 9 year olds camcorder. He interviews Darkseid who has a CGI lower lip and he comes to Earth to get Superman‚Äôs upper lip so he could have both lips. The union of the mother lips gives Darkseid complete dominion over Mother Earth or maybe that‚Äôs how I heard Whedon‚Äôs JL complete cut was gonna be. I can‚Äôt remember.,3
The theatrical cut of Justice League opened with the death of my enthusiasm for the rest of the movie.,3
It‚Äôs not a rumor. Snyder said so on Vero and posted pre-viz screen caps of the opening.    https://imgur.com/a/UvlrPvd,2
"They should "" Deadpool "" the SC alternate opening  In other words.... "" leak "" it ^unless^it's^already^on^it's^way",1
"gddmn that would have immediately pulled you in. The entire tone of the movie changes. That's some serious shit, filled with myth and lore. Your mindset just expands tenfold.  Look I feel bad but I'll be honest, I feel worse for DC comic book ~~fans~~ lifers. You guys might have to wait a decade for JJ Abrams to give you hardcore JL lore.",2
Snyder has such a great vision,1
"Hum... The problem for me is, it still let the same questions of Justice League, of why didn't Apokolips attack four years ago, when Superman was not around. And why they would even attack the Earth in the first place? I'm not sure people how people would react to a baddie wanting to attack Earth because bad guy.",1
Sounds cool until you realize Zack Snyder is in charge.,0
"- Superman's Resurrection - Deathstroke breaking Lex out of prison.   These are the ones that most of the RTSC supporters including me have absolutely no clue about.  There is no leaked images, no confirmations.   Jesse Eisenberg said he had 2-3 scenes that didnt make into the theatrical cut.  But the details are unknown.   If it's real, I have a feeling that the Prison scene might be the most talked about scene just like the Warehouse fight in BvS.",3
"That line felt like a Joss Whedon continuity error. Since the full line goes:  ""It was shelved, until the night Superman died. Then she lit up like Christmas. They brought it to STAR Labs... where my father recognized it... as a perpetual energy matrix.""  Except Cyborg was made by the Box before Superman died.",3
How did Batman's story change in SS?,2
Reading this makes me wish they would've just told Joss whedon to fuck off and waited for Snyder,3
"That's correct.  It's insane what media has come to.  There has been some guy on Twitter posing as an employee of Hot Toys who somehow saw the original Justice League Part One, and Steppenwolf's original alien design was almost finished.    You can't make this stuff up.  Well, actually you can.",3
Zack confirmed on Vero  Edit: but you are right article is shit.,1
Don't forget they find that the source of all human hope is the Monitor's car keys. And they use them drive the Russian Family away.,3
This sounds better than Whedon‚Äôs actual cut.,2
This is still better than the theatrical cut.,3
"""There he is! Darkseid! Darksei~"" BITCH SLAP, camera falls to ground as Darkseid's boots walk away.",1
i didn't read article but justice league is direct sequel to suicide squad,1
Snyder would have absolutely shown Deathstroke unhinged. I'm still mad the original method for Parademon transformation was cut out.,3
">These are the only ones that most of the RTSC supporters including me have absolutely no clue about.  >There is no leaked images, no confirmations.  > >Jesse Eisenberg said he had 2-3 scenes that didnt make into the theatrical cut.  >But the details are unknown.    One thing you have to bear in mind is that (and these are absolute fact):  - Lex had to have some introduction to Deathstroke in the film (so that the boat isn't the first time they meet, which is a bit odd in isolation).  - Lex had to get out of Arkham's secure unit somehow.   - Lex had some (but only a couple of) scenes filmed that weren't shown.   So even with absolutely no proper evidence, I'd say there's a very, very strong body of circumstantial evidence to suggest that Deathstroke busted him out. Otherwise, what are the scenes that introduce him to Deathstroke, and how does he get free?",3
"Thankful ""fan"" backlash caused WB to ""correct"" the course.",3
Deathstroke breaking Lex was from a leak which got little else right.  Also I thought Steppenwolf's axe could transform people as well in Snyder's Cut?,1
Yup. It doesn't make any sense. And I don't believe Snyder wouldn't remember that.,2
"*sigh* This makes no sense.  Whedon didn't worm his way into the possition. WB DIDN'T WANT SNYDER on the film anymore. After he left to attend to his personal matters, WB used the opportunity to axe Snyder and hire Whedon.",3
What makes me sad is that casual fans praise Joss Whedon for bringing the hopeful Superman back.   Actually it's pretty easy to find which superman scenes/frames were shot by Snyder.,3
only the idiots are believing that guy,2
He didn't claim to see the whole movie. Just a reel of specific scenes that would be used for their toy development.,1
What was the original method for parademon transformation?,3
"Wouldn‚Äôt the original parademon work? It worked for the animated kid‚Äôs cartoon, where people are dragged by them and transformed into the monsters. What is the problem?  Also, it is not that scary. Ex: Second Predator and bodies without the skin around. Sure, it is R rated, but cocoons are less explicit, and it would be no means be ‚Äúscary‚Äù.",2
Didn't Whedon reshoot the post credit scene too?  I read that they shot it 2 weeks before the premiere or something.   Snyder wanted Lex to meet DeathStroke and give him contract to kill Batman?  Whedon changed it to setup a Legion of Doom film?,1
Bet they're incredibly annoyed that people listened to the insane blogger fanboys that told them how they thought this film universe should go.,2
"Plus, I mean, Whedon completely redid Cyborg's origin. In BvS he was pretty much a stump missing half his head, and in JL he's basically only missing his legs.",2
I still wish they would have told whedon to fuck off . They should've realized mid process that hiring another director to re write and re shoot another directors vision wasn't gonna work out . Especially when it's like half the movie. I mean what were they expecting avengers v.2. fuck WB they should've waited for Snyder to come back and finish the movie id rather wait longer for a great movie than get a rushed rehashing of a an established franchise. My two sense on things.,0
I heard whedon rewrote like 80 pages of Snyder's original cut. If that's true then Jesus fuck we truly do need a Snyder cut. I just can't help but think about an edgy batfleck taking on a merciless Deathstroke. If Snyder's Batman was anything like that warehouse scene OMG.,3
https://batman-news.com/2018/10/11/zack-snyder-justice-league-parademon-too-scary/,3
"I think the original Parademon transformation was really scary.  There are concept arts which showcased scarier Steppenwolf, Hell-ish Apocalyptic designs, Parademon cocoons hanging from ceiling which Batman investigates.   It all changed as soon as BvS released.  Snyder himself said that they were kind of insecure at that time and changed alot of stuff.   Initial BvS reception had great impact on JL.  The studio should have waited for the Ultimate Edition to be released before making changes.  UE was well received by fans and made a lot of sense story-wise.",2
"Man  , I really wanna see Cyborg's origin in the Snyder Cut",1
Why would they tell the guy THEY HIRED to fuck off?,3
Odds are you'd simply be waiting longer for a different bad movie.,1
"There is an article written by Jon Arryn Garza on ReelAnarchy website.  He went deep into the theatrical cut, leaked scenes, and trailer shots and found out that only around 42% of JL belonged to Snyder.   You ca  also check his Youtube channel - Jon Arryn Garza.  He made a few videos titled history/periodic lesson(?).   Very well made videos on the changes and reshoots.  More people should watch it.  Hope we get Snyder Cut ASAP.",3
"Agreed. Also, enemies being scary is a good thing for the superhero movie.",1
I mean we pretty much saw it in BvS.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1zK30zV508,1
"Maybe when the guy THEY HIRED starting doing massive rewrites to a story that's already been halfway finished and thought out. I heard whedon was like this with Marvel, it's the reason we didn't get Ed Norton hulk, whedon wanted complete creative control other than feige when it came down to the creative process and Norton wanted to be a part of the writing/directing. I imagine DC faced a similar situation with him they should've just told him to fuck off with the rewrites and finish the story.",0
Didn't mean it like that man. It's just my anger speaking. I meant like they should've fired him and told him to fuck off,0
That's always possible too lol.,1
"I‚Äôm curious though, if that‚Äôs the case then why did Joss get only a writing credit instead of Director‚Äôs?",1
">There is an article written by Jon Arryn Garza on ReelAnarchy website.  >He went deep into the theatrical cut, leaked scenes, and trailer shots and found out that only around 42% of JL belonged to Snyder.   Interesting.  Most people have been guesstimating for the last year and a half or so that I thought about 40% was Snyder's (but obviously altered / changed, like the Memorial Park fight being put in the day rather than at night, etc). So interesting to know that gels with what that dude calculated.  Also, with 40% of the theatrical being Snyder's, that supports the idea that if his Director Cut is 214 mins long, then we have only seen just over 20% of it.",1
> Maybe when the guy THEY HIRED starting doing massive rewrites to a story that's already been halfway finished and thought out.  That's the reason why THEY HIRED him in the first place.,3
"Lol...you people really bend over backwards to hate Whedon.   Do you people have concept of how this works? What, you think WB hired Whedon and he just hijacked the production and fucked around doing whatever and WB just stood there?  No, that's not how it works. WB signed off on every fucking thing Whedon did.    The dude was hired by WB to do a job. He did the job THEY WANTED HIM TO DO. What is so hard to understand about that?",3
Let's not blame Whedon. He was doing a job he was hired to do. Some of it was ok. A lot of it felt hokie. But its studio interference not Whedon. WB are the ones who wanted an Avengers League. He did what he was hired to do.,2
You‚Äôre totally contradicting yourself,2
"Yes, yes. FUCK OFF JOSS WHEDON! BYEEEEEEE",0
"I'm not familiar with WGA rules, but I've been wondering for 2 years how WB managed to get away with changing the film that much and still stamping Snyder's name on it for him to take the blame. It's bizarre.  Maybe if he'd insisted on his name being removed, he'd have forefeited his right to a director cut? That's all I can imagine.",1
Well they shouldnt have done that is what im trying to say. Rewriting half the movie at the stage they were at is obviously a bad idea. Whedon fucked the script with that Bs avengers league. Again most of the blame on WB . I feel like my biased hate towards whedon in general is a factor for me being hard on him but yea.,1
I simply don't like whedon in general. Obviously WB is at fault that's not disputed but I just can't help but imagine a finished justice league with Snyder's vision.Whedon as a director should've at least been somewhat original you can't sit there and tell me that he didn't at least have some creative control when he rewrote 80+ pages. Again WB is at fault. I simply absolutely hate whedons justice league and you can't change my hate for him bc I just don't like his work in general as a director and writer.,0
> He did the job THEY WANTED HIM TO DO. What is so hard to understand about that?  He did a terrible half assed job and should have never accepted it in the first place. This isn't a hard concept to understand.,0
Like I said before. WB is to blame as well.,2
I see it now my bad . Fail on me .,2
Lmao touche.,2
I see it this way:  WB loses confidence on Snyder due to BvS.  They use a tragic moment in his life to fire him on the most cruel way posible proving they are pieces of shit.  They are aware that JL builds up a lot for future movies they now don't want to make.  They hire Whedon to make JL have less build up for the future since they don't want to continue this arc.  They let him such a low time because if they delay the movie AT&T buys Warner before the movie is released and the executives lose money.  And that's in my mind how that JL came to be.,1
I'm with you. Never liked any of his work. Avengers 1 included. Once you're past the first viewing you realize what a shitty  film it is.,0
"For the record, I upvoted your comment.",0
I respect you owning it,1
Truly a work of someone under the Anti-Life equation.  This movie needs justice.,1
I disagree avengers is arguably one of the best action movies in the last decade,1
"I misinterpreted my bad. But yea you're right, the studio really shit the bed on this one .",1
Had to man . Integrity over bs.,2
That's cool  I can respect a different opinion.,1
I love that,0
"HBO Max is coming out in May, so if it‚Äôs getting released you‚Äôd assume it‚Äôd be a launch title.",3
"All we really know is that the event was a success at a time when it mattered. Assuming there's movement internally, one can imagine discussions to maximize the impact of its release. There have been hints that Andy Muschietti will be composing a super cut of his *IT* films for HBO Max. A theoretical *Justice League: Ultimate Edition* would blend right in as a launch exclusive on the service.",3
"Maybe around the holidays as a kind of Christmas present they will announce the Snyder cut but with a special package for HBO Max to incentivize early subscription for around something like 3 months, or 6 months that offers a special edition disk set of director's cuts of MoS, BvS, and of course JL.   I realize Snyder has said that he feels good about MoS in its current form. But he has also said that there are longer versions of some scenes. Is there any doubt but that fans would want to see that? So maybe call it an extended edition, whatever. And while I have read some say that Snyder has commented on Vero, and/or stated at the so-called Snyder-con last March, that he considers BvS UE his ""director's cut"" of that movie, it is not so-named and no one has ever provided a link to substantiate it (to me anyway). And there is another hour of footage that he shot in the assembly cut. I know I would love to see a 3:15-30-ish cut of BvS. Including the scene Snyder has mention mentioned of Superman using his super hearing to search for Martha that the studio felt was too disturbing, etc.   The wild card, though, is whether a 3:34 movie such as this gets a theater release. First, that runtime reduces the number of IMAX showings. Second, imo honestly this is advisable if and only if this version of the film really does kick ass. There's a tremendous amount of hype built up now, and the movie has some very high expectations to meet. If it's going to be regarded as a mediocre film or worse by the mainstream then personally I would prefer to see it offered only via streaming and disk.  As we all know, on IMDb the April 3, 2020 slot that was once listed for Cyborg is now displayed as ""unknown DC Film"" with its status is described as ""completed."" If WB goes full open throttle with this and the Snyder cut gets a theater release, it would roughly correspond to launch of HBO Max. The pitch for HBO Max subscribers would be that you'll get this on streaming after the theater run, and exclusively at HBO Max, etc.",2
"I'm thinking WB don't want anything to distract from the upcoming teleases (BoP and WW84), so my guess is the ""dead period"" between WW84 and The Batman. That's like 12 months where nothing's happening.",2
"Apparently, IMDb still shows that WB has retained April 3rd of 2020 for an ""Untitled DC film"" that was supposed to have been the release date of the Cyborg solo film.  If they really release the Snyder cut of Justice League, i want to see it in theatres.  REPEAT  I WANT TO SEE IT IN THEATRES.  Besides, HBO Max is not going to be available in India, where I'm from. So that's going to be a problem if i want to watch it.",3
Closer to the release of HBO max I would imagine.,2
HBO Max launch is the best and most likely opportunity.,1
Maybe Christmas,1
Probably Max (It makes no sense doing anything else),1
"I mean, if the hashtag got over 700k tweets, guess how many #CancelHBOmax could get if it isn‚Äôt a launch title....  The fans have campaigned hard and peacefully. Imagine the feel of betrayal if they don‚Äôt release it. Fans have an opportunity to hit them in the wallet and trend that hashtag on launch day.  Do they want to risk that hashtag trending when streaming wars are at an all time high? If they release it they not only reduce risk but will he on the positive trending side which pays for any additional effort the Snyder Cut needs.",2
"I think it‚Äòll depend on AT&T. If the head of WarnerMedia (who has ultimate say over all Warner companies) sees an opportunity to capitalize on DC fandom, then he might go over Toby Emmerich‚Äô head and mandate it be completed and released. Remember, Emmerich was one of the main architects of the theatrical cut. He and Tsujihara mandates the film release date not be pushed back, because they wanted their year-end bonuses. That‚Äôs a matter of public record. Emmerich has no pragmatic reason to want to release this cut. He was one of the guys shouting the loudest to get rid of Snyder to begin with. The article says loud and clear that Hamada is one of Emmerich‚Äôs top lieutenants, so he‚Äôs not gonna be championing for a Snyder cut. Don‚Äôt want to anger your boss and mentor.",1
If we don't hear something official by christmas I think we should all drop it and never speak of it again.,0
"I hope whoever is head of marketing for it would be savvy enough to call it ‚ÄúJustice League: The Snyder Cut‚Äù. The fans are the only reason it‚Äôd be getting released, and that‚Äôd be a cool little tip of the hat to them.",3
God I hope so. I'd get Max in a heartbeat to see the Cut. I'm not holding my breath for the supposed 4 hour cut but I'd love it if we got the 3 hour cut that may have originally made it to theaters.,3
Will it include the child gangbang?,0
">As we all know, on IMDb the April 3, 2020 slot that was once listed for Cyborg is now displayed as ""unknown DC Film"" with its status is described as ""completed.""

The pitch for HBO Max subscribers would be that you'll get this on streaming after the theater run, and exclusively at HBO Max, etc.  Didn't Snyder say Cyborg was the heart of JL in his version? If we get the Snyder cut in April then It will be a Cyborg movie in a way.",1
Isn‚Äôt Black Adam coming out then?,1
"Id kill to see it in a cinema. We know Zack shot it with an IMAX resolution, and I never saw it in theaters the first time around as I was waiting for the director's cut, so I want to go very much.  It would be perfect, timing wise if they put it in theaters and then released it on Blu-ray and HBOMax shortly afterwards. Maybe give it 6 months of HBOMax exclusivity if they want to, as long as it's available in other countries.",2
There‚Äôs zero chance it‚Äôs getting released in theatres.,3
"Why would they feel betrayed when HBO Max, WB or Warner Media have said nothing about debuting the Snyder Cut on HBO Max? HBO Max literally just had a media day for investors weeks ago listing their upcoming slate and a director's cut of JL wasn't mentioned even though they had a DC segment. Creating a hashtag telling people to cancel a service because you didn't get a movie that was never stated to be released is the definition of fanboy entitlement.",3
"Not trying to put down the movement or anything, but I doubt a good majority of would-be HBO Max subscribers care about the Snyder Cut. Snyder fans are a niche audience. People are subscribing for more than just the DC content.",3
HBOMax was never on my radar until this new push of the Snyder Cut movement and I'd happily start a subscription if the cut was included or was said to be coming to it.   I'm sure there are others who would do the same. And if there is another push I wonder if it'd be worth tagging hbomax as well alongside RTSC.,2
Also why would you think trying to cancel an entire streaming service because you didn't get a product is fair?  It's honestly a petty and dickish mood,1
Meh it's not looking that way at all unless something was specifically said about it today.   Let's both check back here in a few months and we'll see if it's official or not yet.,0
Go for it man. Drop it and move on with your life. Let other people do what they want.,3
"Why? It's not like the SC hurts anyone. The Donner Cut took way more work than the SC would need, and that was completed in about a year from when WB decided to do it (2005-2006).",3
"Yeah, good luck on that one. Going stronger and stronger for two years and you seriously expect it to pop like a bubble day to day?",2
We ain't stopping,2
"You're more than welcome to keep crying, because the movement isn't going to stop.",1
"The Richard Donner cut took literally 25 years. The Final Cut of Blade Runner took years as well. In fact almost every ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry for fucking up the original‚Äù cut has taken years or even decades. Shit, Waterworld just got its director‚Äôs cut after over 25 years, and that was one of the biggest film disasters ever.",1
"Donner's Superman was called ""Donner Cut""  They should follow that IMO",2
"214 is supposed to be the fullest running time. The Twitter campaign had a goal of 214,000 tweets.",3
We've got a problem over here...,1
"This, i can agree with.",1
Nothing wrong in hoping something!,2
"This. People who are thinking of subscribing are wanting to because of what they know they would get, not something tha hasn‚Äôt even been teased by WB.",3
"I get where you‚Äôre coming from, but as last week showed, the SC community is still a considerable number of people (hence a considerable number of subscribers)  so choosing the option that results in more people subscribing doesn‚Äôt seem too outlandish business wise.",1
"Also, as someone that very much wants to see the Director Cut of JL (not a ""Snyder fan"" but very much like his DC movies and feel he deserves to be judged on his JL, not someone else's), I don't want it on HBO as I want the best quality possible and want a disc release to go with my other DCEU film releases.  I feel if it gets dumped to HBO Max, people valuing streamed media less means more piracy. Also, I'm in the UK, and if it's an HBO Max exclusive and I can't get HBO Max, I will be pirating it until it comes out on blu-ray. (Or in theaters, but that's much less likely.)",1
"Yeah, agreed.   ""Oh, enough people have told us to move on. Guess we'd better do it now. Pack up everyone, it's over.""",2
Well damn they quadrupled that. I'd be so fucking happy with 214 minutes. Especially when compared to what we got. 119 minutes of what is essentially trash.,2
To be fair that was the OG Director's Cut which we're not likely to get   The OG Theatrical seems to be cheaper to finish and at 2:45 hours it's not bad,1
"Dude it's a joke.... y'all know about IT right? Stephen King wrote in a child gangbang so that they could ""bond""",1
"If anything, it'll be a limited imax release.",1
For every person here that claims they would subscribe for the Synder cut there's another 9 that outright aren't even pretending they would or are flat out lying by saying they will subscribe and are actually just going to watch the movie online for free when it inevitably gets leaked.  It really isn't the business decision people here want to think it is.,0
"And yet another article came out saying a cut exists requiring very little spending to see it released.   IDK why people on the sub feel the need to shit on this for those who have some hope for the cut or are excited. So you do you. And in a few months when there is more concrete news I'll come back to your comment and either say you were right, or you were wrong.",1
"I shit you not, I think that‚Äôs *exactly* what goes through the ‚ÄúMoVe On‚Äù people‚Äôs minds when they say those two words.",1
3 1/2 hours. Im good with that!,1
"That‚Äôs an interesting uhm, ‚Äústatistic‚Äù you got there. Gonna need some source for it, possibly not originating from your rectum.   Also quite bold of you to talk about what ‚Äúpeople want to think‚Äù while using suppositions based on personal belief as factual arguments.",1
"It's not a statistic, it's hyperbole.  Why don't I flip your logic onto you then?  What exactly are you basing your personal belief on that all these people from the Snyder Cut movement actually plan on subscribing and staying subscribed for a single movie?  What are you basing it on to say a significant portion on the people in the movement aren't going to subscribe either way, meaning there really isn't any loss for them to *not* release it?  What makes you think the cost of finishing and releasing the cut is greater than the amount they project to take in strictly from ""Snyder Cut Only"" subscribers?  You're talking about business decisions and not even considering the actual financial critical thinking that goes into these decisions.",1
"You‚Äôre right, a big hyperbole at that.  What exactly are you basing your personal belief on that all these people from the Snyder Cut movement actually plan on watching a leaked or pirated version instead of the real thing?   I‚Äôm talking about business decisions because like it or not, faux pessimism or not, the hashtag trended like crazy last Sunday. There is clearly a big interest and desire for it, not to mention a lot more hype built around it than any other future DC film. A smart studio would definitely want to capitalize on the  current ‚Äúmost talked about superhero movie‚Äù.",1
"> What exactly are you basing your personal belief on that all these people from the Snyder Cut movement actually plan on watching a leaked or pirated version instead of the real thing?  I am basing it on the reality that, for people who *aren't already paying for an HBO service*, HBO Max is basically offering them a single finite product they want, and once they see that single finite product, paying $15 a month for it is pretty unlikely.  (Yes obviously someone could want repeat viewings but I find it hard to believe the Snyder cut is good enough to justify paying $15 a month for to watch)  You're looking at this decision like HBO Max doesn't already have a ton of subscribers.  It comes with an HBO subscription, and I believe HBO Now and Go are being rolled into it, or something along those lines.  There's a good chance a lot of the people supporting the Snyder cut already have HBO lol.  It's in like 36 million households.  >I‚Äôm talking about business decisions because like it or not, faux pessimism or not, the hashtag trended like crazy last Sunday. There is clearly a big interest and desire for it, not to mention a lot more hype built around it than any other future DC film. A smart studio would definitely want to capitalize on the current ‚Äúmost talked about superhero movie‚Äù.  Yes, I'm not disputing any of this.  But you need to understand, from a cost benefit standpoint, funding it's completion has a poor outlook.  I know no one knows the official number, but a lot of people keep saying it's at least $10 mil and likely more.  So, to be generous, I'll say $15 mil.  At $15 a month for the service, HBO would need *1 million new HBO subscribers* who are *only* subscribing for the Snyder cut and *would not* subscribe without it for the funding of the project to be worth it.  Now yes, anyone who stays longer than a month reduces that number from 1 million.  But again, from a logical standpoint, why would anyone from *this specific* group of new Snyder Cut Only subscribers stay?  Are they getting more Snyder content down the line?  If they do it sure as hell isn't going to be DC related, right?  It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a business standpoint.  It would be like if you and your girl were both cheating on each other and both knew the relationship probably isn't going to last, and decide to get married.",0
"I‚Äôm glad you expressed your point a lot more clearly in this last comment, thanks.  It‚Äôs still built up on suppositions and guess though, and that last analogy is particularly nonsensical.",1
What about the analogy is nonsensical?  Snyder cut only subscribers joining is a relationship doomed to fail.  HBO has no interest in giving them more of what they want.  They literally destroyed the movie in question to show how much they don‚Äôt plan on giving more content like it.  They‚Äôre literally better off just releasing the thing as it‚Äôs own thing for more money.  Making it part of a subscription when the subscription will not be giving them continuous content of it makes no sense.  Look at Netflix for example.  If they sign someone it‚Äôs almost always multi picture (ie Adam Sandler).  It‚Äôs just logical to operate that way as a subscription service.,0
"**GUIDEPOST:** This site has a substantial track record of unearthing complete track/cue lists for scores by Hans Zimmer and his associated composers. Most consumer releases of film scores are incomplete, which makes this site an essential resource for fans of this musical collective. Their coverage includes most of the DC Films scores as of this writing.",1
OK This is weird. Mainly as Steven Price is David Ayers go to composer since Fury. Why would they bring JXL in? Either way the score was sidelined for the jukebox soundtrack they ultimately went for. So ultimately both Price and JXL Would‚Äôve been screwed over either way.,3
"It's in the first comment thread at the top of the page here:  ""Hybrid Soldier	2019-11-24 22:58:53 The studio killed Suicide Squad AND Justice League. That's exactly why we want a Snyder Cut. **Oh and Junkie wrote a whole score for Suicide Squad, btw. As a back-up. Price's score got better test screenings... Would be interesting to hear !**""  So, some context as this comes across as total bullshit. Hybrid Soldier -- the one who commented this -- is known for having connections in RCP. They commonly update the Hans-Zimmer.com site with tracklistings and credits of scores, which is considered the go-to source for RCP insider info. Hans Zimmer's personal account is in their official group on Facebook as well as a few other RCP composers. Comes across as hearsay but, as I'm sure anybody who knows what H-Z is can similarly say, they're absolutely legitimate.  Edit: This just made me realise that Junkie has worked on just over half of all DCEU films, lol -- Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, and now Justice League. Tough break.",3
Holy. What the -   I need this.,2
This isn't that far fetched. Remember Age of Ultron?,3
Did all of these movies have 2 versions and we just saw the most ‚Äúmass friendly‚Äù focus group tested one?,2
What?! Oh please release them both! Junkie and Snyder would make my heart burst with joy.,1
"Semi-related, but can anyone explain if there is a way to download scores from this site? I'm particularly interested in the Batman Begins expanded score, but I'm not sure how to find a download (from here or elsewhere).",1
a back up score. lol.,0
So theres three scores? Doubt it.,0
"Fully correct, just wanted to clarify what constitutes an acceptable score on Hans-Zimmer.com for anybody curious. Essentially, the site is dedicated to Remote Control Productions, Hans Zimmer's score company. Any composer in this company, and any score they compose, will be posted on Hans-Zimmer.com. RCP is a large organisation, and they're thus everywhere in Hollywod. The DCEU is therefore quite heavily represented here. So far, Suicide Squad (Steven Price), Birds of Prey (Daniel Pemberton), and The Batman (Michael Giacchino) will be / are the only DCEU scores left off of the site:   * Hans Zimmer - Man of Steel   * Hans Zimmer & Junkie XL - Batman v Superman   * Rupert Gregson-Williams - Wonder Woman   * Geoff Zanelli & T.J. Lindgren (Additional composers) - Justice League   * Rupert Gregson-Williams - Aquaman   * Benjamin Wallfisch - Shazam   * Hans Zimmer - Wonder Woman 1984  More specifically, the big part of this site is unreleased scores. Hybrid Soldier pieces together cues from performance rights organisations like ASCAP & GEMA and combines them with their sources to detail unreleased scores. [This is the complete tracklisting to Aquaman, for example](http://www.hans-zimmer.com/index.php?rub=disco&id=1709). It's how we learn what the unreleased scores are like before they actually release.",2
"It never gets mentioned, but I actually liked Price's score for Suicide Squad lol! I'm a bit confused as to how this came about too, but there's no way it isn't legit.",3
Indeed. Hybrid and the website are both legitimate and credible.,3
I thought it was just Hans Zimmer on Man of Steel.,1
"I doubt it's circulating and it for sure won't get an official release, so I wouldn't hold my breath we'll hear it anytime soon.",1
"They actually do go into Age of Ultron a bit in the linked thread. That was an interesting score too, lol. The leaked recording sessions are eyeopening as to how much of Tyler's score was really on the cutting room floor.   Whedon bringing on Elfman went substantially worse for the DCEU as the MCU had little in the way of score continuity preceding AoU. It's a shame.",3
what happened with Age of Ultron?,2
"If so, they should always release the B version of the score, even if they retitle it to avoid audience confusion.  Like much of Steven Price's SS score was unused, IIRC, but the whole thing got released.   At least that way we can hear it, the studio and the artist can make some money, and faneditors can reintegrate if the test audiences were wrong and it's better.",1
"No, it's not a piracy site. I can direct you where to download them if you PM me, though.",1
"Backup is probably bad wording on Hybrid's part, but I wanted to be specific to their wording. Rejected scores aren't an uncommon occurrence: http://web.archive.org/web/20160615041707/http://rejectedfilmscores.150m.com:80/list.html",2
"Where are you getting three scores from? There's one released and, from this, a second unreleased one by Holkenborg.   Hybrid is legit regardless. I don't expect people to believe otherwise without knowing the site's history, though.",1
Price's score is great. It's a shame they didn't use most of it. His Harley and Joker piece is particularly fitting.,3
"My man, cheers for the support. Was worried there'd be a shit ton of comments decrying this as obviously fake.",3
"Pretty much all of Zimmer's scores employ additional composers. Man of Steel was worked on by Zimmer, Andrew Kawczynski, Junkie XL, and Steve Mazarro.  Batman v Superman was Zimmer, Steve Mazzaro, Andrew Kawczynski, Junkie XL, and Benjamin Wallfisch  Wonder Woman was Rupert Gregson-Williams, Andrew Kawczynski, Paul Mounsey, Tom Howe, Thomas Farnon, Evan Jolly, Halli Cauthery, and David Buckley   Justice League was Danny Elfman, Geoff Zanelli, Pinar Toprak, and T.J. Lindgren  Aquaman was Rupert Gregson-Williams, Andrew Kawczynski, Evan Jolly, Tony Clarke, Steve Mazzaro, Forest Christenson, and Sven Faulconer",2
"True. Even though I find Tyler's score to be more interesting than Elfman's (Ironically though I'm kinda mad they kept using the Avengers 1 theme instead of the one Elfman made which is easily the best track he made for that score).  Yeah. It's just not very interesting to just hear the Batman and Superman scores from the old movies here. Especially when I think both of Zimmer's Batman themes were better than Elfman's honestly (Which is great, but I find it better as a song outside a movie than as part of the score). And I still don't get why they used Williams' Superman theme when ""Flight"" is so underused. Because it's iconic? So was the 90s X-Men theme and none of the X-Men movies had to rely on that to sell themselves.  It's almost like WB thought they could just get people to see the movie on nostalgic pandering or something.",3
"I imagine he's referring to the fact that Brian Tyler composed the entire film, only to get bumped off and have the bulk of it replaced by Danny Elfman. It's more similar to Justice League than it is to Suicide Squad imo, but regardless, rejected scores (Tyler's AoU score still had parts used, so not really fully rejected) are sadly not too uncommon.  Edit: [Here's the tracklisting of the leaked recording sessions](https://i.imgur.com/nBREjUW.png). That's 3 and a half hours of score for a 2 hour and 20 minute long film, so the score was a bit of a shitshow. According to Hybrid's comments, Elfman was in the process of replacing all of Tyler's prior work.",3
"Oh, I see. I didn't think it would be considered piracy as I figured maybe Hans Zimmer released the albums personally or something. Thanks for clearing that up!",1
"I'm assuming he thinks you mean JL, and hence he thinks there are three, the third being the Elfman one.",1
"Aye, the Joker / Harley & Deadshot cues are all great. I'm quite intrigued to hear who Gunn picks up for The Suicide Squad. I'm betting Tyler Bates, which I'm all for: both Guardians of the Galaxy films had excellent scores.",3
"Been keeping tabs on the site since MOS (huge fan of Zimmer's work and film scores in general), so I came by Hybrid's contributions honestly. Cheers!",2
"Love Tyler's score for it a lot. I kind of go back and forth between disliking it and thinking it's better than all of the Silvestri Avengers scores sans Endgame. People tend to trash it over on the Marvel Studios subreddit, but I really think it's the only Avengers score (again, sans Endgame) that was really that cohesive.   Elfman and Williams' themes are both fantastic, but wholly unsuited to the tone of the DCEU. Motifs belong to their own depictions, and you get this weird tonal backlash when paired with the contemporary ones. Granted Justice League did try and do a 180 with the actual tone of the DCEU, it's still strikingly odd. The 89' Batman and the Reeve Superman themes are not selling points, so why go out of your way to shaft things further? Granted, Joss Whedon is the absolute last person that should be handling scores. He was the one who specified Elfman resurrect those themes.",2
"Oh nah, essentially the owner / admins just compiles information on RCP scores. Since they have official sources in RCP -- meaning they know Zimmer and other RCP composers -- they're also a source of unreleased information themselves.   How they release is entirely separate to Hans-Zimmer.com. They're essentially sold and traded in a ""score black market"", which are then leaked on the internet when they lose enough value in said circles.",1
Nah. I mean Suicide Squad.,1
Bates also scored *300* and *Watchmen* for Zack Snyder.  Gunn is the current king of blockbuster-tuned licensed soundtracks (the trailer editors who took over SS could only attempt to imitate his skill) and Bates is an accomplished composer in the CBM space and beyond. Win-win all around.,2
"The site is honestly a god send for leaked scores and keeping up to date with RCP releases. As far as credits and such go, it's absolutely pertinent for me. I'm interested in hearing if Hybrid will glean anymore information about Justice League. The Suicide Squad tidbit caught me by surprise, would have absolutely never guessed Junkie wrote a score for it.   On the topic of credits, did you know that Elfman actually had Geoff Zanelli (Pirates of the Caribbean & regular RCP additional) as well as Pinar Toprak (Captain Marvel) doing additional music on Justice League? I was similarly shocked to hear both of them had a tiny bit to do with the League.",2
"It boggles my mind why WB specifically dumped a completed score just to spend more money on a score that didn't even fit the movie at all. JL wasn't nearly grand enough for Williams' score, didn't have the gothic darkness needed for Elfman's Batman theme (Lest we forget that Batman Returns is still by far the darkest Batman movie?), and in every other track was forgettable. They even ruined Diana's theme. That guitar riff was awesome and they ditched it for a generic Elfman violin. Ugh.",1
"Junkie revealing he finished his JL score was HUGE. We already knew from the production timeline and a few telling remarks that he was well into the scoring process, but learning he finished it was a bombshell for many fans.  It truly is. I remember when such information was far less centralized and alternate and complete scores/cues were largely hearsay and fan dreams. We have had absolutely zero indication elsewhere that Junkie scored SS in parallel with Price.  Didn't know of their involvement in JL, but it doesn't surprise me. The eleventh hour nature of Elfman's involvement cannot be understated. It was an unenviable position, and I'm sure he needed the help to make the deadline.",2
"I mentioned this further down the thread, but Justice League and Age of Ultron both mirror each other perfectly in how much Whedon fucked their scores. I almost feel bad for Elfman getting caught between Whedon and the public, as I feel he tends to catch all of the blame for it. He's absolutely responsible for how the scores ended up, but people really overlook just how much of a part Whedon had to play in how it unfolded.   There isn't a single track I'd say is actually good in Justice League. The only part that comes close is the heist scene with the  Wonder Woman reprisal, but it'd be liberal to say ""good"" for that, lol. It's annoying how we now know there's a complete score that'll almost definitively use all of the DCEU themes just sitting there collecting dust.",1
"> I remember when such information was far less centralized and alternate and complete scores/cues were largely hearsay and fan dreams.  Are you familiar of a fairly infamous leak site starting with F? It went ""down"" the other day and attempts to automatically download malware now. I'm quite concerned to see how leaks operate going forward, as that'll decentralise the community quite substantially. In general, I can't say I'm a fan of how scores work. OSTs tend to be preened, people are forced to pirate just to listen to large portions of the music, and entire scores collect dust. It's a shitty way for music to be released, and it's irksome that there's not enough interest in scores to warrant proper releases for 99.99% of scores.  > I'm sure he needed the help to make the deadline.  For sure. Age of Ultron and Justice League are eerily similar in how their scores were handled. Whedon had finished scores ready to go, and instead chose to bring in Elfman at the last minute to rewrite the entire thing. Even if he did use Zimmer's themes, I can't imagine that the end result would have been too good. A lot of famous composers nowadays employ additionals too, and the amount Elfman used wasn't egregious at all. The first Pirates of the Caribbean was actually completed in 3 weeks with a team of 9 composers.",1
"Damn, is that a coincidence or an M.O. of his?   Collaborative scoring is nothing new to DC fans. The joint Zimmer-Junkie credit precluded their MOS and BvS scores from major awards considerations, after all.  Can't say I am, but I hear you on the woes of being a scorehound. Despite the endless opportunities provided by digital distribution, official releases are still constrained by what fits onto a CD. It's a real shame.",2
"> Damn, is that a coincidence or an M.O. of his?  I'm not personally confident in calling it an M.O as it's ""only"" two films, but it's still pretty substantial, and just as annoying.   > Collaborative scoring is nothing new to DC fans.   Aye, RCP scores tend to include quite a few additionals. I've seen a good few people outside of the RCP circles take issue with it, but I feel modern film composing trends towards it in general. A good number of major composers do it nowadays. Performance rights organisations are where a lot of credits are sourced from, which is reliant on the composer actually crediting their additionals. People should be taking less issue with composers like Zimmer, and focus on ones like Brian Tyler: that dude doesn't credit *any* of his additionals, which means they receive no royalties.   > Can't say I am, but I hear you on the woes of being a scorehound.   Ah, said site is where all of the DCEU scores have leaked. In fact, I'd wager that it's where 99.99% of score leaks have occurred. There was actually a discussion about how unreleased scores drop on /r/DCEUleaks the other day, but they're essentially traded & sold until they lose enough value to be dumped online -- on that site. I wouldn't be surprised if it's recovered, but the owner has been MIA for years. Would be a big hit to decentralise the leaking community.",1
"Appreciate your thoughtfulness and knowledge in these matters. It's sadly rare to encounter someone more invested in facts than a position.  >but they're essentially traded & sold until they lose enough value to be dumped online  Could you elaborate more on this, here or in private? I have always wondered what the process has been from guarded recordings to the eventual emergence of these complete scores on sites like YouTube.",1
I can't believe anyone let that into a movie. Just awful.,3
That‚Äôs cruel.,3
Don‚Äôt you dare,3
"‚ÄúHope is like your car keys.....‚Äù   I don‚Äôt care what version of Superman you prefer, that line is fucking awful lmfao",3
In the words of GlaDOS:  *You Monster...*,2
BLASPHEMOUS!,2
Why is John Travis playing Superman?,2
Gonna tell my kids this is The Polar Express.,2
"I'll never forget seeing this. Hell, the anticipation and curiosity of seeing it.   There I was, excited, yet nervous over what I was about to see. Knowing everything about the reshoots and CGI mustache rumors.  And then THERE IT WAS. In the first fucking scene! Set the tone for the rest of the train wreck hahaha",1
"Gonna tell my kids Joss whedon did this...  ...oh wait,",1
I fail to see the humor.,1
Everyone makes fun of the cgi bit I literally can‚Äôt even tell the difference,1
And its the fucking opening scene. Way to set the mood.,3
"They thought they could just rip off the MCU ‚Äúformula‚Äù but didn‚Äôt realize that the secret to the MCU is that it‚Äôs actually created with passion and effort, and its directors are actually allowed to carry out their visions for the art that they were hired to create‚Ä¶",2
I wasn‚Äôt even aware of that much of the BTS drama. I still thought it was gonna be like the trailers :( I was so sad and disappointed that day. I just felt empty,1
Whedon? He‚Äôs just a fall guy. WB was the brains of the organization,2
It‚Äôs a popular meme format going around right now. ‚ÄúGonna tell my kids X is Y.‚Äù The joke is that X is not Y. It‚Äôs stupid so it‚Äôs not for everyone,1
"Perhaps they were fooled that they thought it would work after it kind of worked already (Suicide Squad), financially anyways.",2
"Ermmm not entirely true. MCU writers are not exactly passionate and often conflict with what the directors want. i.e. civil war, endgame.",0
"Fret not, my friend. Time will tell but it sure is looking like we'll get to see exactly what we wanted from the trailers :)",1
"You mean?, He didn't write this scene in or Geoff Johns????. It was Kevin Tsujihara all on his own??...wooow, thanks man.",0
"I think Infinity War was written almost perfectly. Every single character interaction and first meeting goes down exactly how you would expect it to. IW blew me away with how well it was a crossover between ten different sub-franchises, and how well it blended together all the different characters and the styles that had been established for them in their own movies  I don‚Äôt remember any big problems with the writing in Civil War. I think Civil War did a much better job than BvS of making two heroes (two groups of heroes) fight each other in a way that didn‚Äôt require either hero or group to be unheroic like Batman is in BvS  Every time I listen to Feige, the directors, or the actors talk about the movies, they mostly come across as smart, genuine people who are passionate about the art that they‚Äôre creating",1
Yeah I know. Just trying not to set myself up for any more disappointment. This post was actually made in the hopes that I‚Äôll actually get to show my potential kids the real Snyder cut :),1
"I think WB was the biggest problem. They restricted the runtime to two hours and didn‚Äôt delay the movie. I think Joss probably tried to do the best he could with the time he had, and I feel like WB probably wanted him to try to make an Avengers clone. I don‚Äôt really see a reason to vilify him when WB was clearly the bigger issue. His other movies I‚Äôve seen are great",1
"ENDGAME not infinity war E N D G A M E. Inifnity was great, no doubt.  No problems with civil war?.  - the avengers were fooled by a guy in a rubber mask posing as Bucky, even with all that facial recognition tech and clearly would have been fake it fooled them?. Dumb  - BP constantly popping out of nowhere, dumb.  The ending was the worst way to develop it, having a security camera in the middle of nowhere in 1993, when before you can see there is literally nothing in the surrounding area, it was like a last minute addition before it went to cinema. It was an outrageous sequence. It was one the cheesiest marvel has done.  The character logic is stupid, vision can pick up Thor's hammer but can't apprehend a single avenger going against him, like Hawkeye, falcon, or even ant Man. Hell, he just take them all on and hold bucky. It's the most ridiculous concept execution marvel has done. But hey, it 'looks cool' riiiiight??.",0
I've tried to remain pretty optimistic with the mindset that anything they release will likely be better than what we got hahaha. Fingers crossed!!,1
"I doubt he was happy with this, and he was pushed to this direction by Geoff Johns and KT. Everyone else who was apart of that Warner Bros. team no longer works there.",1
And we‚Äôve already seen a massive step up in quality and have hope for the future again,1
"And what movies are those considered as a step up?. Joker, yes, I'm with you. I don't see muchof a difference to any other superhero movies that aquaman or Shazam bought to the table?.",1
"I disagree. Aquaman was a unique visual spectacle I‚Äôd never seen anything quite like in live-action before, it had an awesome soundtrack, and it felt heroic, inspiring, and triumphant, even if it was basic or cheesy. It‚Äôs about on the level of MoS and WW to me. This is a massive step up from JL. Shazam! was an extremely heartwarming story. It was lower-budget but still had cool visuals, action sequences, and music. Extremely enjoyable IMO. Again, a big step up from JL. Both movies felt like they had way more passion put into them by the cast and crew than JL",1
I can't argue with that one. Fair enough man.,1
"I miss these ads, they make me feel nostalgic. My favorite one is probably the Dark Knight one with Bale‚Äôs Batman",3
Good ol cow juice.,2
"Holy shit, I haven't seen this I was in elementary school. Thanks for the nostalgic rush.",1
What are the chances of Joker surpassing TDKR's box office?,3
Hopefully it can knock down Aladdin. It has 15 million more to go.,2
"We did it, you guys. We killed the minions.",1
"""We won't do R-Rated movies because they don't make money""",1
TDKR Box Office is 1.085b,3
"Probably not without a re-release or some kind of expansion (expansion seems unlikely tbh, but a rerelease if it gets Oscar noms could push it past that mark. It‚Äôll likely finish around 1.05 -1.065B otherwise).",2
slim,2
Movies about genies where people make wishes can go fuck themselves.,1
"I would see Joker finish around 1,07B and 1,1B after the Oscars season. But whatever, below or above DKR, these numbers are fucking insane for an R Rated (and legendary without China)",2

"Poison Ivy isn't in BoP from what we know. Hopefully in Gotham City Sirens whenever that happens. Given DC uses any excuse it can to have a lesbian couple (Arrowverse. There's more lesbian couplings than any other), it seems like the move they'd make, and I'd like to see it happen. To me they make more sense for a damaged-but-affectionate couple than what they tried with Leto in SS.",2
"I seem to remember seeing somewhere where one of Harley's tattoos which was simply the words ""HQ üíö TJ"" has the TJ crossed off and ""PI"" written next to it.",1
Meehhhh how about no love interest?,1
They decided to make their friendship completely platonic on the new animated series for some reason.,1
"DC just likes to tease these two toguether but never deliver on actual canon  See the Harley Quinn animated series, they are just close friends again and Ivy apparently has a boyfriend.",1
"I never got the passion for this pairing in a romantic way. Whats wrong with them being friends?! Also isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúshe was in a bad relationship with a guy and then becomes a lesbian‚Äù kind of a cliche and borderline offensive trope?   I really have no interest in this and before people scream I‚Äôm anti LGBTQ, let me tell you that Batwoman is my favorite female superhero ever.",0
u/jacemandaspaceman1 hehe thoughts?,1
True haha DC has a big lesbian boner,1
It would really tie her character journey off in a good way. Having Harley in a better relationship by the third movie.,1
gah i want Ivy in the batman movies. I hate that the Harleyverse is separate from what Reeves is doing.,0
"Really? I remember a moment in the teaser trailer where Harley falls on top of Ivy, and their faces end up really close to each other. Now they‚Äôre platonic?",0
Bruh that‚Äôs what I was hoping to see the series explore,1
"Hello! this comment has 69 words in it so i alphabetized this comment: ~~~~  Also Batwoman I I I‚Äôm LGBTQ, What a a a a a and and and anti bad becomes before being borderline cliche ever. favorite female for friends?! got guy have in in in interest is isn‚Äôt kind lesbian‚Äù let me my never no of offensive pairing passion people really relationship romantic scream superhero tell that the the then then this this trope? was way. with with wrong you ‚Äúshe  ~~~~",1
"Then again, who doesn't?     I'll leave now.",1
"There's too much of it right now. Every second scene on Black Lightning, Supergirl, Batwoman and to an extent LoT is about women talking of their feelings about and to other women. If you need to be inclusive, you need to be all inclusive. Feminism and women empowerment seem to be synonymous with lesbian/man-hater. It seems so unnecessarily forced as opposed to it coming naturally. Shudder to think that the Barry/Iris and Olicity moments were a walk in the park compared to what it right now.",1
Yeah all reviews say it‚Äôs not even hinted at in the first season or first 13 episodes. Poison Ivy develops a relationship with Kiteman.,2
Kaley and Lake also flat out spoiled that in one of the first BTS videos from Harley Quinn   I assume it's in the back 13 episodes that will be released in the summer maybe?,1
Me too...i'll give the series a try but my expectations are low now.,1
Some like it hot.,1
"Yeah and the writers don't seem to know how relationships work. Its like ""these two characters have the same sexuality, if they meet they fuck"".",2
Hell yeah?,1
"Well, that fucking sucks. Oh well, rest of it looks fun.",1
"Hmm, thanks for sharing!",1
Sweet! Was just wondering when this would drop.,1
Been needing this! :D,1

"I gotta say I REALLY hated the redesign choice for The New Batman Adventures. Actually, I wasn't too thrilled with a lot of the redesigns for that show, like how they made Catwoman and Poison Ivy look younger than BtAS.",1
Phoenix > Ledger > Hamil > Nicholson > Romero > What we've seen of Leto so far (I can't definitely say Leto is at the bottom considering 90% of his performance was cut out).,3
Cameron Monaghan ?,2
Phoenix shouldn't be smiling.,2
"I cant read the DAMAGED, so I dont know if he is damaged",1
I like the 6th and last 2 lol,2
The second looks awesome. Phoenix's one too! Great art aniway,1
Noice! Dope you kept leto too,1
Why does the one from 2004 looks like beetlejuice,1
"Leto is my favourite. I loved the direction they were going with him, such a shame we didn't see more.",1
Top three for me would be:  1. Phoenix  2. Nicholson  3. Ledger,2
I like the fact that Leto's Joker just had squiggle marks on his forehead lol,1
Where is LEGO Joker wtf,1
'92 Joker over there looking like Klarion.,1
Love the inkblot/rubberhose style inspiration here. My favorite style.,1
The new Batman version joker looks lit,1
I can‚Äôt decide between 1992 to 2009,1
Ahw cute!,1
"I feel like the three biggest omissions would be the versions from *Gotham*, *Batman: The Brave and the Bold*, and *The LEGO Batman Movie*.

Nice. You should have added birds of prey joker.,1
It always saddens me when people refuse to add Cameron Monaghan...,1

"**Joker in other media**  The Joker, the archenemy of the fictional superhero Batman, has appeared in various media. WorldCat (a catalogue of libraries in 170 countries) records over 250 productions featuring the Joker as a subject, including films, television series, books, and video games. Live-action films featuring the character are typically the most successful.The Joker has been portrayed by Cesar Romero in the 1966 film Batman; Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman; Heath Ledger in the 2008 film The Dark Knight; Jared Leto in the 2016 film Suicide Squad; and Joaquin Phoenix in the 2019 solo origin story film Joker.

I actually like The Batman's design for joker.,1
"They legally can't call him Joker but anyone who has seen the show knows he is. And it's [Jeremiah](https://i.imgur.com/QqAsuRf.png) that eventually becomes the real Joker, not Jerome.",3

"Not that you'd wrong, but this is probably why people don't care",3
WB's restrictions are really dumb at times.,2
Why can‚Äôt they call him joker?,1
Utter shite is exactly how I'd describe that.,0
"Idk man The arkham Joker makes them seem like normal people,best version by far",2
"Part of the deal for making Gotham stipulated that they couldn't use certain names like Batman and Joker because the higher ups at DC wanted to reserve those for titles in the DCEU.            They didn't want the waters muddied, so to speak.              In fact, they couldn't even use Joker's green hair. The fact that Cameron gave such a fantastic performance while working within the confines of that agreement speaks to his extraordinary talent.",1
Your downvotes say otherwise,1
"Idk its kinda easy, you know? Like yeah he played hannibal and modern calendar man os inspired by him but it's just kinda meh to me.",3
It‚Äôs too on the nose. Calendar Man in The Long Halloween is essentially Hannibal Lector in The Silence of the Lambs. It‚Äôs perfect but just so obvious.,3
"He'd be great, this version of the character is based on Lecter after all, but I'd be worried he'd just phone in his performance like he does with a lot of his more recent roles",2
I mean it's right in his wheel house...would be awesome,1
"Hopkins can play whoever he wants and it'll turn out awesome regardless.   Let him play Batman, I won't mind. Hell, I bet he'd make a great Poison Ivy.",2
"Hopkins played hannibal lecter in silence of the lambs, and calendar man from the long halloween was based off of that role so it makes sense",1
Get Tim Blake Nelson in this movie.,1
Good but too old,1
Nah I'm gonna have to go with an inspired choice and say Tony Shalhoub,1
No and No cause he's already Odin and he eats people in real life,0
I'd go Woody Harrelson,1
He would have been a great Alfred. But now I wann see him as  Poison Ivy!,1
"I feel like Woody plays the ‚Äúcrazy psychopath‚Äù better than he plays the ‚Äúcalculating psychopath‚Äù role. I could see it, but I think someone else could be better.",1
"I can see him as an old wise Alfred that guides Bruce to become Batman.   If he's ever cast as Alfred, the movie should focus on him.",1

"Clearly you have low energy. Go meditate somewhere, kid.",0
It's literally a Joker reference you potato. I'd rather have low energy than a low IQ.,1
But what if I didn‚Äôt see the film or don‚Äôt remember every reference from the film? That means I have low IQ? You just proved how ignorant you are which means you literally just called yourself a hypocrite. You also just proved that you really do need to meditate.,0
"Right, nothing else to say. Never start what you can‚Äôt finish. You‚Äôre soft.",0
>But what if I didn‚Äôt see the film or don‚Äôt remember every reference from the film?    Then why are you commenting on a post about the movie?  Go take your meds.,1
Maybe you need to meditate if you expect a reply within the hour. Some of us actually have other things to do and don't keep refreshing the comments looking for a reply.  Based on your comments you're clearly mentally ill. Get help.,1
Maybe I wanted a reminder of what part of the film it‚Äôs from or maybe I simply wanted to know what it means. I didn‚Äôt know wondering or even asking something was a bad thing. Why are you worried about another mans comment? You made yourself a hypocrite once again. Keep making yourself looking stupid and ignorant.,1
But how do you know I kept refreshing the page? Looking dumb again. You continuously making yourself a hypocrite because clearly you need special attention. It‚Äôs easy to talk behind the internet isn‚Äôt it?,1
Expect something closer to Bale‚Äôs Batman than the hulking mass of Batfleck.,3
I don't know why people are expecting him to be roided out. He'll likely have a similar slimmed down physique to what he has now. Idk why batman has to be a gigantic mass monster.,3
"I‚Äôm expecting him to be lean, like Christian Bale in TDK.",3
"I‚Äôm gonna echo the Bale call here.  Frankly I don‚Äôt want him to be that built.  This Batman seems to be more of the detective and more of the stealthy type, and that just thematically works better as athletically built and agile, instead of a linebacker IMO.",3
I think he will be more leaner - like Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock in Daredevil.,3
Ripped? Absolutely.  Put on significant muscle mass? Nope.,3
"I mean it's no real indicator yet, an athlete or a career athlete would be noticeably bulking or cutting by now but celebrities live in a different universe, give it a month of extreme diets and trainers and you can completely change your body shape (obviously not very healthy or recommended)",1
I honestly think he‚Äôs fine as he is. I don‚Äôt really care as long as he doesn‚Äôt get as big as Affleck.,2
"Bale's BEGINS physique was on point. Especially in the training montage. Also, because of his suit and cowl design, his neck looked thick and made him look formidable as Batman even though he couldn't turn his neck.  TDK and TDKR suit might have made him agile and granted him flexibility, the same made him look leaner than BATMAN should be. Let's not talk about the amount of armor plating on that suit :-/",2
"He's probably not gonna be in Mr. O shape, so take out 2 and 3.",1
I just want to say I like the Arkham origins suit.,1
Maybe 20 lbs no more imo. I wouldnt like him too big,1
No push-over but def light on his feet + strong. Think swimmers build. Always been into Batman being the scrapy underestimated power-player.,1
A Neal Adams Batman look.,1
As big as he can get so he can look like this BvS suit mannequin when he wears the suit.   https://i.imgur.com/JgU1JK4.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/MruLytg.jpg,1
He considered PEDs but planned to do it natural.,1
"While I loved Ben's brutal brute batman, I would REALLY love to see an agile, fast ""ninja"" Batman who fights intelligently. A surgeon as opposed to a blunt instrument.",1
He looked pretty big when he was wacking off in the lighthouse üëÄ,1
I'm thinking that first one.,1
There's really no way to tell. Almost all the Superhero actors were rather slim before bulking up. I can see him going to a level close to Bale though as well. Batfleck was just Batman in Beast mode  ....Damn I miss Batfleck,1
Depends on what source material they'll be using,1
He's not gonna get ripped at all.,0
Of course. I mean The Dark Knight returns Batman was always bulk as F. He was no regular Batman.,3
"Bale was pretty big, much bigger than pattinson will ever be. Its just that his suite was very slim. Affleck was pretty huge, but his suite had alot of muscle patches integrated on top, which made him look like a beast.  If pattinson manages to pack on about 20 pounds of weight, with good distribution to its overall structure and about 10-15 pounds muscle, that would be amazing, but also extremely hard to achieve. But even with +20 pounds he is still pretty slim. And I think its totally fine to have a more athletic and less beastly Batman",2
Christian Bale and Ben Affleck were the same weight in Batman Begins and BvS.,0
"He literally joked about changing his steroid policy with his trainer.  I don‚Äôt expect him to get huge by any stretch of the imagination, but he‚Äôll probably bulk up noticeably.   Hoping for a bit more of the summer suit look though; I agree, no need to be a gigantic mass monster.  ...which is a fun phrase.",3
"I suppose this is an unpopular opinion around here but I‚Äôve always preferred the slimmer, agile Batman to Affleck‚Äôs hulking brawler look. Batman‚Äôs supposed to be an Olympic-level acrobat.",3
Bcoz have to hit bane.,2
> Idk why batman has to be a gigantic mass monster.  Cause he's huge and ridiculously strong,1
"I'm all for a lean Batman but Pattinson is not only lean right now, he's flat out skinny. Even if you conpare him to Ryan Reynolds who has a lean and muscular physique, Pattinson just looks lanky in comparison.",1
I think based in some depictions of him. A huge batman makes sense. For scenes like the warehouse fight where he explodes into a room and takes people down like a wrecking ball.   But a leaner kung fu and gadget batman is also compelling ! And I imagine we will get something like that.,1
"well the ""batman"" is supposed to resemble a monster. Idk I always thought that ideally batman would be intimidating af. He is supposed to be scaring people. A good way to do that is if he is twice your size",0
The thing is that Pattinson is not even athletically built righr now.,2
Bale actually was in really good shape for TDK/TDKR just his suit had no muscle padding so it made him look a lot skinnier than he actually was. His physique in those movies reminded me of Neal Adam‚Äôs Batman quite a bit,2
"Such a shame Affleck never looked like that in movies, it looks so much better here. Really makes the suit look better too",1
Yeah I mean the dark knight returns Batman is so muscular he could strangle a cow with his bare hands,2
"Bale definitely was huge in Begins. The suit, as awesome as it was didn't do him justice physically.",3
But their cut was completely different. Bale was all about definition and Affleck was all about mass and bulk.,3
"Highly doubt that. Ben is taller, and AT best Bale was the same build (and probably actually smaller)",2
The suits were completely different. Look at Affleck's massive gut in his suit lol.,0
"I personally think it depends on where he is in his career as Batman. I personally think he should start leaner and over time become a bit larger and more bulky, with the level of bulk in hush being the final stage.",3
Well Ben's Batman at certain points was really turning into fatman. You could tell in BVS nad JL when he was in shape and when they needed to reshoot his scenes.,3
> Batman‚Äôs supposed to be an Olympic-level acrobat.  He's also supposed to lift 1000 pounds so you won't do that looking like a stick. He should look as bulky as Evans.,1
This is him in [2018](http://cdn02.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2018/02/robert-pattinson-bares-ripped-body-while-shirtless-in-antigua.jpg). I don‚Äôt know what he looks like atm but if trainers can do what they did for Bale and Pratt I‚Äôm sure Pattinson will be just fine.,3
"Agreed, Pattinson would wound up being something closer to Neal Adam's is what I think.",1
Muscle weighs more than fat. It could be that affleck had a higher fat percentage and retained more water.  Bale was lean as fuck.,3
I don‚Äôt think Affleck had much fat during BvS.,0
I mean they CGI'D abs on to him during the training montage.,2
"I could definitely get behind a premise like this, however I have few changes that I wouldn't mind seeing.  First, there needs to be a Batman, you can't have the JL without the Bat, and whatever form that takes I'm down with, either we have Batman Beyond situation, personally wouldn't mind seeing Terry McGuinness on the big screen, or option two is do a Flashpoint movie first to explain the recasting of Batman.  I would like to see Zatanna  have a role in the movie, but with what you're going for I don't really see a spot for her.  The end credits of JL4 should tease the Monitor or Anti-Monitor in some form",2
"You need Superman and Batman to be huge part in the movie. Fucking Katana wouldn't fill this void...(and I don't think she should be in the team when u have HUGE DC characters  that are yet to be introduced to the team such as Green Arrow,Martian Manhunter,Blue Beetle,Hawkmam,Green Lantern,Firestorm,Black Canary). I think Atom should be Ray Palmer. Ryan Choi could be his intern as a nice easter egg/possible future down the line.  Part IV should be huge. Darkseid should not be the villain. Needs to be a threat to the greater DC Universe..something that'll include The JLA,JSA,JLD,Teen Titans..like Nekron/Trigon.",1
I'd love to see this!,1
Not bad though I still feel a mix between the Legion of Doom and the Cadmus Conspiracy from JLU would be amazing,1
"Not a fan of reducing Brainiac to the name of a ship, least of all for the Dominators.   Speaking of, the Arrowverse already did the dominator invasion thing. We don‚Äôt really need to see that again.",2
"I feel like if not even participating in the action, JL2 needs Ben Affleck to return and/or a replacement to Batman that makes logical sense (Nightwing).",1
Shuffling off Cyborg makes me uncomfortable especially since Katana is not a leaguer.,1
Honestly I would rather have Batman be recast with no explanation than to use Flashpoint early specially to explain a recasting situation. Recasting happen in the industry and if they‚Äôre accompanied by good storytelling people get behind it pretty quickly. Then we can have a great Flashpoint at some point that does r have the burden of trying to explain real world shenanigans.,2
> or option two is do a Flashpoint movie first to explain the recasting of Batman.  Why use an entire film just to explain a recasting?  Did Marvel have to make a multiverse story for you to accept Mark Ruffalo replacing Edward Norton as Banner?,2
I thought Mera looked way better in Justice League than she did in Aquaman. Hope she goes back to a similar look in future installments.,3
"If a man had done something similar to what Amber Heard did to Johnny Depp, he would have been publicly humiliated and fired from this franchise by now. I hope Amber gets her just desserts soon enough.",3
Yeah nobody can deny she looks good. But damn she leaves a bad taste. What she did to my boi was fucked. And she doesnt get penalized for it. Wish Mera was recasted tbh.  Edit: incoming white knights that are defending her just cuz she's hot when god forbid some of us want some justice and fairness in calling her out in the DC community,3
I would say nice but Amber is an abuser so,3
"What a shitty human being, all things aside",3
"For everyone asking:  ‚ÄúIn 2016, Amber Heard came out and said that Johnny Depp had abused her. She included photos of her face showing multiple bruises, and released a video of him drunk and angry, slamming cabinet doors around her, throwing glass bottles, etc.  However, straight from the get-go, her story was flimsy; the video she made was shown to be edited, taken out parts where she seemed to interrogate him and kinda mock him. The reason he was drunk and upset was because he had just found out his mother passed away. Multiple friends and other police officers said that the photos showing her bruises were nothing more than make-up.  Ten days ago, Johnny Depp filed a lawsuit against her. Today, the documents were released to the public.  In short, the documents alleged that Amber Heard lied about literally everything and instead, she was the abuser. There was a time where she apparently hit him so hard that a portion of his finger tore off, then she also allegedly said under oath that she was the one to constantly attack him and this whole thing wasn't for money but instead just to advance her acting career. Johnny Depp submitted 87 sets of surveillance footage of his house to the courts, which show that there wasn't a single case of abuse. There was apparently a few times where she punched and kicked him, with one time being said where he was late to her birthday party so she punched him in the face, etc. Those attacks were regularly seen by friends, security, etc.‚Äù  Edit:spelling",3
Don't like her lying ass,3
Amber the Abuser       \#ambertheabuser,3
Hate amber Heard the abuser,3
Screw her,3
Hard pass. Hope she gets recast going forward.,3

"Yeah she looks great, whatever. So would any other pretty actress in that outfit. She sucks and should be recast.",1
"Fuck her, I wish they recasted Mera. She wasn‚Äôt even decent in the role and people only like her now because she‚Äôs good looking despite her being a manipulative and abusive piece of shiitake mushrooms.",2
Wow so amazing.,2
Aquaman‚Äôs BvS suit > Aquaman‚Äôs JL suit & Aquaman Proper suit   Mera‚Äôs JL suit > Mera‚Äôs Aquaman suit,3
I'm yet to see Justice League,2
Her JL suit looked way better than Aquaman.,1
"Amber looks so beatiful as Mera, downright stunning.",1
"Nice to see people here not forgetting how much of a violent, manipulative, and lying cunt this woman is. They need to recast her ASAP",1
Boooooo!,1
It looks much better than her Aquaman suit. Also the hair.,0
Amber is perfect as Mera.,0
"I dunno, I‚Äôm not a big fan of the big bulky armor her and Arthur were wearing in this movie. I feel like if they used this tiara with the bodysuit from the solo movie it‚Äôd be the perfect comic look.",3
She won‚Äôt. That ship has sailed.,3
"Totally disagree. There‚Äôs way too much happening in this suit. The one in Aquaman is perfect. Simple, accurate and very pretty. Same with Aquaman‚Äôs.",3
I liked both suits in their respective films. My only visual criticism would be Mera's hair in *Aquaman* when she's in a dry environment. It had the obvious volume and saturation of a wig.,3
I definitely preferred her hair in Justice League at least. It felt far more natural than the super deep red in Aquaman.,2
"Lol no Zack did many great things but Mera and Aquaman suits were not among those, their suits in Aquaman Solo film as any other suit in that film were just perfect",2
"The only thing I didnt like about Aquaman was Mera's super bright red hair... All the other special effects in the Aquaman film were more realistic and immersive  than Mera's hair!  Aquaman was crazy entertaining though.  Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazam righted the ship... I loved Joker but I'm so disappointed it's a one-off.",2
"Yeah, agreed. She looked like the little mermaid in AM, like a cartoon character! The colours was just too damn bright, and that‚Äôs for everyone, the costumes was so off putting.   If you look at MoS, BvS, JL and WW, everyone looks normal with costume design and quite realistic, everyone looks quite militaristic which makes sense, but in AM, everything for me was too much like a comic book, that‚Äôs fine if everything else was the same, but if those characters turned up in MoS or BvS, they would look ridiculous",0
Zack gave us less clivage more fierceness. I knows how to do female characters,0
> I hope Amber gets her just desserts soon enough.  Lol yeah right women being punished for abusing men nice joke,1
Don't worry. God knows.,3
Oh god just stop with this,0
"Not to mention that all her costars in Aquaman banded around her and supported her even after everything that happened with Johnny. Fucked up, but that's Hollywood.",3
What did she do? And to whom?,3
She gets away with it because she's an attractive woman. What a joke.,3
"Seriously, how the fuck has she not been punished for this?!  Atleast recast her. Won't be hard to find another actor of her type for this role. I would personally try to get Anya Taylor-Joy in the role.",1
Who?  Zack Snyder?,0
"Nonsense. Whole case is still on court. Amber also gave her own proofs. Soo court will decide who is victim there, not you.",0
But it's still her ass \*\_\*,0
She is perfect as Mera.,0
"It's kinda interesting how they didn't settle on the Atlantian cultural style until Aquaman. In BvS it was influenced by Mamoa's Hawaiian roots. JL it's medieval/high fantasy. Aquaman it's full blown sci fi.  I personally prefer on what Wan went with, it's such a unique visual style, it really pops.",3
Wow really? Wait he had a suit in BvS ?,3
Wooaahhh nothing beats the og Aquaman suit,3
The BvS suit is next level I really want to see it in a proper scene,2
Don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a abomination,3
"I don't blame you, it hasn't released yet. 2 hour trailer has too many bad moment, don't try it.",2
No one but Zack Snyder and some of his close friends have seen Justice League.,2
There are parts that are obviously great since they were shot by Snyder but its painfully noticeable when it switches back and forth between both directors. The score is also in my opinion horrible and bland thanks to WB and the new composer( Danny elfman?) so overall I say skip it and wait for the Snyder cut. Even if it never comes out you won‚Äôt have the horrible taste left in your mouth from what could have been. Justice league was probably the biggest disappointment of the 2010-2020 decade.,0
"Your last IGNORANT sentence made my day lol  So now gothic, dark humor/black comedy is considered creepy and weird? Gtfo",2
So she should go unpunished for domestic abuse and then blaming the victim because she looks good as this character?,2
"I think it works for a ""get the big suit for the ultimate fight"" sort of thing, but prefer her in more comic accurate costume for the rest of the time.",3
You nailed it. This Tiara was really good but the actual costume was way too busy and overthought just like Arthur‚Äôs.,3
"Can either be considered bulky though? With both I think it's really just the shoulder guards, which I actually like on Mera's suit. Didn't like it on the Aquaman JL suit. But if you compare his suit in the solo and the suit in JL they are essentially the same but different design pattern and color. Same fit, one with shoulder guards one without, and the solo gauntlets have fins.",3
I certainly wouldn't say that the armor was big and bulky. It looks pretty streamlined to me. Lightweight and with mobility for armor.,1
"I disagree, the purpose in all the costume designs in MoS, BvS, WW and JL wasn‚Äôt to be ‚Äòaccurate‚Äôü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, they was to show ‚ÄòWarriors‚Äô and ‚ÄòRealism‚Äô  If anyone turned up in MoS or BvS dressed like the characters in AM, they would‚Äôve got laughed at  The DCU started out as a realistic approach but AM looks just like a cartoon in the designs! Just too much, if the rest of the universe looked the same, that‚Äôs fine but it‚Äôs way too far from everything else!",2
"I liked the one in AM but I dont think the Tiara fits at all. Would've prefer this suit or a different one in the throne scenes. Otherwise, the AM suit is great as casual attire.",1
"in aquaman, her suit show most cleavage so that's why you prefer that",1
A sequel is confirmed.,1
You‚Äôre right. Sexualizing isn‚Äôt always bad but if Mera ever willingly goes into battle in her cleavage costume I will kill someone.,0
Domestic abuse of Johnny Depp then lying about it,3
She's an abuser.,3
"That's life dude, you're gonna likely side with the person you know more. I promise you that you ain't perfect and that whoever was at blame in their relationship, both people did more than that share of convincing people to their side.",3

Domestic abuse to johnny depp,3
She's a nasty bed shitter for one.,3
Google would probably be faster for you my friend,2
"You, Frankenstein.",3
Amber Heard is a domestic abuser.,3
"All the people asking what happened in the this thread and **you** because you took the trouble to comment and whoever the person named ‚ÄúWho The F‚Äù is because like you said, they care :)",1
She's dragging Johnny Depp through the mud and its known that she lied about it and has a history of being abusive to her partners,3
Well she's a bed shitter.,2
"Wan called dibs on the golden scale armor, which is at least one reason why we didn't see it earlier. They really made it work in *Aquaman.*",2
"I think that‚Äôs because although Snyder had his vision, he wanted to leave it open to Wan since he was directing the main Aquaman film  Edit: I like Wan‚Äôs style, but I think I prefer the Snyder fantasy style more",2
"I think the one he used in the ring of fire fits the BvS one. In fact, even the orange one isn't that scifi. It's *everyone else*'s wardrobe that made it all seem sci fi.",1
"Just my opinion! Yes he has minimalistic armor in BvS. Tbh it looks better in behind the scenes pics, due to him only being in one scene and it being underwater",3
"Can‚Äôt lie, Momoa pulls it off. But I think it‚Äôs still cheesy.   I like Snyder‚Äôs / Momoa‚Äôs darker look more.",2
Would‚Äôve loved it in JL!,1
Haha I won't then.,1
"I will wait for the Synder cut. Maybe it comes out next year, we shall see.",1
Alleged abuse.,0
"having shoulder gaurds makes all suits bulky, and i freakin love it. Using shoulder guards would be great if a flashpoint movie happens.",2
"Then they did it wrong. You have a source material there‚Äôs zero point why you wouldn‚Äôt follow. Looking for total realism in these movies is Pretty silly.   But the suits didn‚Äôt go completely different though. What‚Äôs so different between those suits in the movies compared to the ones in the comics? The armoured Batman suit was basically the same from TDKR.   The suits were fantastic. Aquaman, Mera, Black Manta and Ocean Master were on point. As a fan from the Aquaman comics I was incredibly happy to see them being translated to the screen so perfectly. That‚Äôs everyone fanboy‚Äôs dreams.",2
How are you even sure about this? Just because some article you found in the internet said so?  There's no real truth to this. People are just jumping to conclusions.,1
Has she been found guilty yet or are people just assuming? I'm I'm the middle in till its confirmed.,3
Frankenstein is not a shitty human being,0
What did she do to him?,1
Oh man His design in BVS was definitely going for a realistic approach cause I can picture Aquaman looking like that if he existed in the real world.,2
There's like literally 80+ surveillance videos of the abuse.,1
Mera's my favorite character and her JL suit is way better. Maybe if they had added scales to her Aquaman suit like they did to Mamoa's then I would actually think it's good. But it looks cheap with the hexagons. In the comics they're actually scales. So far from perfect and being a fanboy's dream.,1
Ew white knight!!!,1
"The evidence is video surveillance footage so if she‚Äôs not yet guilty, theres something wrong with the justice system",3
I dont remember 100% but there were pics and proof,3
Yes he is. His monster is not.,1
"Her lies got him removed from Pirates of the Caribbean, so no more Captain Jack Sparrow because of her",3
Women ever getting convicted for domestic abuse lmao,3
Those the video surveillance was concrete evidence,3
There were also people shitting on Depp for a very long time and petitions to have him removed as Grindelwald. People even shit on JK Rowling for sticking up for him.,3
Dam what a hoe. Shes hot tho lol,2
"She‚Äôs a terrible person no doubt, but do we really want a 6th pirates of the Caribbean movie?",2
IKnowRight?,2
Yeah there's no doubt there lol,2
"Now, were getting a reboot.",1
I want it,2
It highlights the studios failures.,3
As much as people don‚Äôt want to here it the major con is that Warner Bros would be going back to Snyder‚Äôs vision. Warner has made it clear their trying to move on from the Snyder era.  Releasing the Snyder cut would be reigniting Snyder‚Äôs fans and likely cause fans to demand they resign him to direct more movies   If you love Snyder‚Äôs movies that‚Äôs great. If your WB and wanting to move away from Snyder‚Äôs DC vision then that‚Äôs not something you wanna do,3
The cliffhangers we will be left with that will likely never get fulfilled.,3
"The biggest reasons would probably be consumer confusion and money.   It could cause confusion among the GA, if you have two versions of JL that are quite different, people might get confused, especially when some people are already confused about what's happening with films like The Batman, etc.   And with money, WB might not want to put more money into a project that they lost money on, especially when a big reason it lost money was due to the hefty reshoots they did to specifically avoid releasing this version. That said, recent rumours suggest that it's mostly complete and that Snyder may have been completing parts in his own time, so if it is ready to go they could easily put it onto HBOMax at a minimal cost.",3
"It will take money to finish, even if all the scenes are shot there are still expensive editing to be done.  They might have to pay some of the actors again to release the movie.  It can really only be released on HBO max and they might worry about it branding their service as a place for behind the scenes and directors cuts as oppised to new high quality content.",2
"Great discussion.  Considering Batfleck is out, Cavill still a mystery. Releasing the Snydercut can be awkward as we‚Äôre in a sense seeing them reprise their roles when their future is unclear or nonexistent.  But they can roll with the punches considering Joker is a different universe, The Batman may be as well. Maybe they aren‚Äôt putting together a concrete universe which can be fine. As long as we get movies.",2
"1. Just because it's in watchable states as Momoa claim doesn't mean it's finished. There need to be a lot of editing, CGI and sound mixing not to mention the score might need change as well. These thing are not come free and it would cost a lot.   2. Snyder era already over and you guys need to accept and move on. DC are go with different direction and a lot of cut content in JL can contradict with their future release.  3. There are high chance Snyder cut gonna getting even more negative feedback and with DC slowly coming back. That is the last thing they want.  4. There are high possibility that JL Snyder cut is instead of give Snyder fan closure, it will spark another of their movement instead... like going back to Snyder direction or demand studio for Ayer cut. Which again not something studio like to bother with.",3
"They will not replenish the money they lost from the movie by dumping more money into it to finish it, no.",3
>	make a lot of money from this   No? Why on earth would they make a lot of money? A minority of a minority of people would care about it and the casual viewing audience wouldn‚Äôt even know the difference. So few people would purchase it that it‚Äôs absolutely not worth their time no matter if it improves that dumpster fire of a movie or not.,3
It will undermine everything they have planned for the future,3
"You run the risk of the Snyder cut being more critically maligned than the original theatrical release of JL, dragging the DC brand through the mud again (which could damage the good will that was earned with these past few releases).Which considering Snyder‚Äôs track record isn‚Äôt unfathomable.",3
The cost of completing it would be a significant con. If they wanted to use Junkie XLs score there'd be issues with music licencing.  Another potential con that a lot of people don't like to consider is that Snyder's cut could be even more poorly received than the theatrical cut was.  BvS was a deeply unpopular movie and the studio taking over the movie from Snyder and then eventually replacing him was their attempt to move away from BvS. Releasing the Snyder cut might dredge up anti DCEU sentiment they are trying to move away from. Unfortunately this is why they might not be too enthusiastic about Cavill donning the suit again too.,3
Prolly that it costs several million dollars,1
"It may be just as, if not more shite than the theatrical cut. People hate on BvS but at least the theatrical cut was short - the ultimate edition is just a longer mess.",1
"The only con would be if hypothetically speaking the film turned out to be ""the unwatchable mess"" Wb said it was, on wich case wb would now have to really bad JL movies instead of just one.  But I highly doubt that the snyder cut is bad",1
I guess it would potentially confuse a general audience to release what is essentially the same film (I mean obviously there‚Äôs massive changes but this is still the first story of the league forming as they take on Steppenwolf) and would further muddy what is already an unclear direction for DC films.,1
It sort of brings light to the studios missteps (I know missteps is a wild underscore) while also going to be a little disappointing as a lot of the threads will be unresolved,1
The movie would still be fucking garbage like BvS?,1
Probably nothing.   Casual Audience who watched the theatrical version will be surprised by the changes in SC and definitely say it is better than TC.  CBM Fans who knew how disastrous TC was will be eager to see this and will understand how reshoots affected the final product.  DC Fans who complained about Superman being broody will finally see a better version the hopeful  superman.  Snyder Cut supporters will be enjoying the moment as they see all the above people recognizing wbat they've been fighting for 2 years.  The only con is regarding the bloggers and people who denied the existence of SC despite all the evidences for reshoots were readily available to them and now they gotta take back their own words.,2
Wanting the 5 story arc,1
It shows that Warner was wrong for how they carelessly handled Zack Snyder‚Äôs film.,1
"There are none. This ""omg WB would never do it cuz it's like admitting failure!"" argument is stupid.   No. There is nothing negative that can't be buried and ignored by good marketing and fan praise.   If they make money and fans praise WB's grace for listening a releasing it, any poo-poo tossed at them won't really register.",0
"Releasing a Snyder's cut, the way the fans meant it, will interfere with the plans of all other directors working on DC projects right now. First of all, with Ava Duvernay and her New Gods, which is a high budget film, and also with the new Batman trilogy. The rest of the films and ok, but they have proven that they can survive on their own.",1
There is no con.  Allegedly it‚Äôs the idea that showing the Snyder Cut will somehow cause mass confusion (and hysteria) by creating a second continuity.  An idea that is beyond laughably stupid.,0
Nothing. The SC hurts nobody. Even WB could spin it as them learning from mistakes and getting better.     Literally nobody is hurt.,0
Nothing besides maybe hindering the hype for Pattinson‚Äôs Batman. I think the argument of WB not wanting to look bad by releasing it is false. I don‚Äôt think studios even care how they look as long as it‚Äôs at the expense of a quick buck.,0
Continuity.,0
They probably don't want to admit that they lied or dredge up their past mistakes. They've moved on successfully.,0
If it‚Äôs successful Snyder coming back to direct more movies,0
"Yep, this mainly.",3
"If they do release it they'll easily spin it as them being a caring company and listening to fans, like paramount and sonic's redesign",3
So there was a surge of support from the cast to release the cut on Twitter yesterday!   https://twitter.com/4eyedRaven/status/1198746091950239744?s=20,1
It's a shame.  I felt like this was going to bubble to the top.  :(,1
"I disagree,  but that doesn't mean I'm right. I loved Snyder's vision, and I really want the Snyder Cut. But I don't expect them to finish his vision, wouldn't be upset if they don't. I would hope most people understand they are going in a different direction.",2
"The thing is this.  WB wanted to move away from the Snyder era, under Geoff Johns.  They wanted to after the massive failure of JL.  But at the same time Aquaman hit a billion and Wonder Woman likely will do gangbusters as well.  What a lot of the Hollywood insiders are hearing at this point is WB saw what they could do with Joker and believe they can make films in and out of continuity and be successful.  So it comes down to if they release the Snydercut, and fans lose their minds loving it.    It is massively screened on HBO max.  Makes them a great return on investment.  Sells merchandise.  If all those things happen for it, then it would be absolutely a good business move to finish his work with the follow up JL movie they wanted (After he introduces fourth world and all of these characters we found out about)     Technically the Snyderverse goes strong anyways.  And there has been a lot of directors and actors who left because they were there for the Snyderverse and not the Geoff Johns Marvel copy verse.  In my opinion, especially when the MCU is really in a way going to be starting new, this is the best time for DC to set a precedence of having a movie universe kind of the same way they build a comic universe.",1
>resign him to direct more movies   Dear God no please...,2
We already have cliffhangers like that. Theatrical JL had the Legion of Doom thing.     So what's the difference?,2
I didn‚Äôt think it of this one!  Very true :(,1
"Dude, I think non-brain damaged people grasp that this is a movie and an alternate cut. Probably no mass suicides over the fact Silas is dead in this Cut or Darkseid is alive and known.",1
I'm praying for a second Alita!,1
"Zack shot it to end and not be a cliff hanger because he had already lost Part 2.  But the only thing would have been an introduction to Darkseid in the history lesson and at the end of the film.  Would have been as little as Thanos turning around in his seat.  Would just be one of those things that any future film could look to and say ""I want this character or these characters, and they're taking on Darkseid in this movie!""",0
"> It could cause confusion among the GA, if you have two versions of JL that are quite different, people might get confused, especially when some people are already confused about what's happening with films like The Batman, etc.  I think the talk is that it is likely only going to be finding itself on HBO max.    As they need exclusive content to sell the service especially at the price it's at.  So I don't think it would end up with too much confusion, unless it does great there and there is a limited theater run.  ANd considering the billions spent on Big Bang theory and friends, I think the 10-20 million needed to finish the film wouldn't be anything they'd question.  The number of 30-50 million has always been not only the VFX but likely legal fees and paying the hundreds of actors for screen time or roles, where their credited role was changed so they earned less or they weren't in the film at all, so they don't get residuals.  Just paid for their time on set.",1
">It could cause confusion among the GA   I mean we're already having a Joker film out here that has no relation to DCEU at all, so that doesn't seem like a real problem to me.",1
That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I want to see the Directors cut!,0
"> Just because it's in watchable states as Momoa claim doesn't mean it's finished. There need to be a lot of editing, CGI and sound mixing not to mention the score might need change as well. These thing are not come free and it would cost a lot.   There is no need for editing.  Many of the processes they've worked on from pictures shown by Snyder are only done with picture lock.  SO no, editing is finished.  Junkie XL recently again stated that before he was fired he did finish the score.  Pictures were shared of Gal Gadot in January doing ADR.  the only thing confirmed to not be done by the VFX supervisors for the film is that they said a great many  shots were complete and some were nearly complete.   >Snyder era already over and you guys need to accept and move on. DC are go with different direction and a lot of cut content in JL can contradict with their future release.  Except he is still a producer on films, meaning he has input and helps with production.  As is his wife.  All the DCEU movies will still follow his lead.   >There are high chance Snyder cut gonna getting even more negative feedback and with DC slowly coming back. That is the last thing they want.  Where does this ""high chance"" come from?  >There are high possibility that JL Snyder cut is instead of give Snyder fan closure, it will spark another of their movement instead... like going back to Snyder direction or demand studio for Ayer cut. Which again not something studio like to bother with  We will.  And if they do release the Snyder cut, it would lessen the bad look even more to release Ayer's cut.  Which is done anyway and would cost nothing for them.  We absolutely already plan to fight for Ayer's cut after we finally get Snyder's",0
"Well they'll make a profit. Snyder Blu Ray sales do really well, and compared to a minimal 5 mil to polish the movie thats fine.",0
Hmmm I am under the assumption it was near completion.  They put 30 million into reanimating Sonic!  They can put a million or two into this.,0
"So what you‚Äôre saying is, it‚Äôs never going to happen.  I wonder if they at least discussed it yet :-P",1
Nobody in the GA cares about continuity.,2
"what  if they call it the ""unofficial release"" :)",0
Disagree with your first and third points. The GA probably doesn‚Äôt know or care about this possible release and have moved on from it. Also who‚Äôs to say it doesn‚Äôt double down on what Snyder did with BvS and turn people off again like that film. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but didn‚Äôt we already see a more improved version of Superman in JL than in previous films?,3
">Casual Audience who watched the theatrical version will be surprised by the changes in SC and definitely say it is better than TC  But why would they? Why would they magically love Snyder's films all of a sudden? JL was more well received than BvS, it just lacked the gargantuan OW than BvS did.",3
>The only con is regarding the bloggers and people who denied the existence of SC despite all the evidences for reshoots were readily available to them and now they gotta take back their own words.   Either that or bash the Snyder Cut regardless of how it turns out. You KNOW there are some who are more than ready to do just that.,1
"It's not so much that the ""SC doesn't exist"" but rather it's discarded takes that have not completed editing and/or post processing so if you released the movie half of it would be in a different audio/visual Fidelity than the rest of the movie.  So you can either convince them to splice back in the unedited scenes (not likely as the finished product would not look professional or acceptable at all) or convince them to retouch / process the scenes which is very expensive so they would need a good financial reason to do so and it's unlikely to make enough money to warrant it.  At the end of the day they're still a business trying to make money and the amount of people interested in the SC just isn't really enough to warrant it.  So if you really want a con, it's ""WB will lose a lot of money appealing to a vocal minority and that hurts future DC film prospects""",1
I‚Äôm not looking forward to Pattinsons Batman and I loved the skinny animated Batman series lol,0
There is a lot of buzz atm mayyyybe they can put it straight to dvd!,1
"Paramount did listen to fans and changed the design, they did not bring another director on board and change the previous director's story and writing.",3
"Now tell me, did they change the story? Are the other Sonic characters that the fans love in it?",1
Fine WB. I'll take that. I'll be grateful that you heard the fans...,1
"They would do it if the film is successful.  As they do with any property, trying to make a follow up.  But it all depends on that fan response and money earned.  I don't think critics would even really be a factor this time around if it is just on HBO MAX.    Just times streamed and talk generated.",0
Get him a better writer thats all.,1
">Releasing the Snyder cut would be reigniting Snyder‚Äôs fans and likely cause fans to demand they resign him to direct more movies  If the Snyder Cut is good, why not?",0
That's a stinger/teaser. Not a cliffhanger.,0

People arent going to flock to buy a super duper directors cut of a flop from 3 years ago.,3
Yeah but sonic has yet to be released.,2
That was actually a rumor that got disproven. It actually took less than 5 hours to reanimate; apparently the footage from the first trailer was the only VFX completed.,2
Wasn't it about 5 million for the Sonic redesign?,1
No not saying it's not gonna happen. I haven't watched justice league so I can watch Snyder's cut with fresh eyes if they do release it. But you were asking what some of the cons would be.,2
I didn‚Äôt really say anything about continuity. GA will still get confused when they end up seeing adverts for something they watched two years ago. I still know of people who aren‚Äôt really invested in these films wondering why Christian Bale wasn‚Äôt in BvS.,1
I think that would be even more confusing than calling it the Director's Cut,3
"They aren‚Äôt discarded takes. The film was picture locked since January. We know he‚Äôs worked on VFX since pre production and he had months of post production. The score is complete. The only question is just how much of the VFX is left, those who worked on the film say it‚Äôs close to being done while recently Jason Momoa has implied that it IS done.",2
"HBO Max is worth a WHOLE lot more than home video.  This is another thing people are missing big picture for in the Pro category.  Getting a million people to subscribe for a year is worth farrrrr more than blu ray sales.  Domestically BvS sold 3.5 million units since 2016.(They haven't updated the data since late 2016.)  Clearly most of these folks liked what Snyder was doing enough to bring this movie home.  If 1 million people buy a year subscription for HBO Max it is worth 180 Million.  There is a great many people that would sign up solely to get their hands on the Snydercut.  Not to mention the other DC plans.  (I'm assuming they're going to grab DC universe into their library.)   I will buy the year sub just to thank them and there will likely be a buy a year deal.  Where people that just don't get around to cancelling their subscriptions will also end up giving more than the cost of a home release with just 2 months on the service.  Then they can sell it after it does the rounds on their service for a couple months to people on home video.  Which I will also buy.  But again these companies do their best from people just forgetting to unsubscribe.  Or people buying year subs and really barely using the service.  I have a bunch of these at this point.  I still bootleg just about everything I watch, as I would do with the Snydercut.  (But I still make sure to play the stream on the background when I want to support something, as I will constantly do with the Snydercut.  Make sure they know I'm subscribed for one thing.)",1
">Paramount did in and changed the design,  I know they did, and they did it because they listened to the backlash.  but what I'm saying is that WB changed JL under scummy circumstances and to avoid having to own up to the fact that they changed the film behind his back when he had to leave for a family tragedy, they'll just give off some lie that they're listening to fans and that they care about their fans so they're releasing the cut.",2
"Sonic fans can't agree on the other characters anyways. One second the narrative is ""Sonic needs to get rid of his stupid friends"", next it's ""what happened to the colorful cast of characters"".     I will never stop ragging on the Sonic fanbase.",1
"No, paramount didn't. But they've had a massive wave of positive press from changing the design.  What I'm saying is that if WB release the Snyder cut they'd want to spin it as something positive, as if they were doing something like Paramount did, as if they're doing something for fans",1
"The VFX artist working on it just said they had to go back and plug in their original design.  So whatever the movie was when that first trailer arrived, it was also the same when the new trailer arrived.",1
"Again, what's the difference? We're never gonna get the Legion of Doom, we're probably not gonna get Darkseid. Plus, JL did wrap up a lot in itself, otherwise it wouldn't have been a 214 minute movie. Even though Darkseid was teased, it's not like Infinity War where it's clearly just Part 1 of a 2-part contained story. JL1 was more like the third book in a 5-book series where most of its own story was self-contained with hints to the future.",2
Snyder is posting pre viz shots. Doesnt mean that those shots never were finished. Just means those are the images he has on hand.   And vfx being unfinished doesnt mean they need to edit the film whatsoever.   Like i said. The guys in charge of vfx said most was finished. Some shots werent. That henry shot was from the opening of the film. So likely finished.   The movie by mark hughes who works for a top publisher is said to be 90%+ complete.   Which may be 90% on what they initially wanted as a theatrical release.  2 hr 51 minutes. But still. No editing. Just vfx shots worked on,1
"They flocked to the Donner Cut. Hell, the BvsUE Blu Ray earned 22mil. The SC has even more hype built around it than either of those.",0
"How would they be confused?  ""Director's Cut/Extended Cut"" is pretty self-explanatory...",1
True!,1
"I actually think that they will spin it that way. And Twitter events were part of it. It will allow them to say, ok we listen to fans and Gal, Ben, etc and we're giving you the Snyder cut.",1
"Most of us don't care how it gets out, and WB trying to save face is A-ok with me for sure.  After all, just about everyone involved in those decisions were fired.  Fired in the way execs get fired, where there are contract extensions but you clean out your office and get the hell off the lot, but we also will give you a production company and a first look deal.",0
Superman 2 wasn‚Äôt a flop it was a well reviewed box office hit.,3
If anything that makes my case stronger. Nobody cared about a Donner Cut (Mainly because Donner didn't have a complete cut until he came back in 2001-2006. He only shot 70% of his film). JL was more disappointing and people are more ardent about getting the SC (Which is complete) than they ever were about the Donner Cut. There is simply more to be gained in improvement with the SC (Even though I argue the Donner Cut is vastly superior to the Lester Cut).,0
I love how one JL CGI mustache is shown in those compiled pictures.,3
"*Oh, it's beautiful.*",3
This only makes me love him more,2
"Mustache's are hard to pull off, but Cavil rocked the fuck out of his.",2
"Yeah I think Cage could have. No one thought Keaton could have either but the take was strong enough it worked. I think between Burton and Cage and the writer they‚Äôd have come up with something compelling. Cage is also a really great actor when he‚Äôs on, especially at that time.   I didn‚Äôt read the script but if they played Cage as a Clark who really struggled to be the kind of normal and invisible that Reeves one was, there‚Äôs something fitting and dramatic in that.",3
It would have been a special for sure!,2
god no,2
"He was Superman in a voice role for the [Teen Titans Go! To The Movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Titans_Go!_To_the_Movies) low-budget animation, and his son, Kal-El Cage, voiced a young Bruce Wayne.  I s'pose it would be interesting to see Nic Cage don the cape for the Arrow-verse Crisis event. Perfect opportunity for a live-action cameo.",2
"I think it would have been interesting to see a Tim Burton vision of the DC Universe. I liked his two Batman films, and I think Nicolas Cage as Superman could have been as intriguing as Michael Keaton as Batman was: Non-traditional but very compelling.  If you haven't seen Jon Schnepp's documentary about the Burton-Cage film, it's definitely worth watching.",2
"Back in the 90's Nic Cage was on top of the world. This Superman film would have come out right after Face/Off where he displayed great skills playing dual roles, showing he can do a more subdued down to Earth character too. Besides all that's surrounding Burton's film I think Nic Cage's portrayal of Superman would have been great and a positive addition to the character's cinematic history. He would have brought the more alien characteristics to the role, trying to figure out who he is, and where he comes from. A welcome reinvention after Reeve's movies. Too bad it never came to pass.",2
I think [he](https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/12999224_web1_cagenicholasweb.jpg) would play a good [Eradicator](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dcanimatedmovieuniverse/images/6/61/37118133_487300525015618_6415507939842326528_n.jpg),1
He would have  been great.,1
"No!!!!!  Seriously, people saying ‚Äúoh man it would‚Äôve been great in a weird way!‚Äù are just trying to be funny or ironic or whatever.   Superman Lives would‚Äôve been a fucking disaster.",1
"""The bees.. ! No, wait. What was the line again? Oh yeah.. Oh no, the kryptonite! Not the kryptonite!""",1
"He's too ugly to play Superman. Might sound silly, but it's true, lol. Supes has to be played by a handsome actor.",1
not in the slightest.,0
"I think the problem is that Nic Cage can‚Äôt do insecure Clark Kent, he would just do Nic Cage, he can‚Äôt play strong without being larger than life either, and Superman needs to be a hero for the people and be down to earth. Joe is similar but in that movie he was super dry, Superman needs to be a beam of positivity ya know.  Michael Keaton‚Äôs Bruce worked as a rich guy who is content with his life and enjoys his romantic life, that worked for the material he was given. I don‚Äôt personally think many styles would allow that iteration to work quite as good, yet for some reason I‚Äôm now thinking the way he played Bruce is so much better than the movies themselves.",0
Didn‚Äôt people say the same about Keaton?,2
"You're not famaliar with Cages earlier work are you? Hes legitimately a GOAT and could have easily pulled off Clark/Supes. It's just getting past the fact no matter what physical changes he makes, hes going to look like Nic Cage.",1
I'd say that argument still holds up against Keaton. Keaton only works in Burton's hyper idiosyncratic world.,0
At least with Keaton his face is covered most of the time.,1
"How far back?  Also, it‚Äôs 90s Nic Cage, it‚Äôs not exactly top tier",0
"Well considering it was to be Cage in Burton‚Äôs Superman I don‚Äôt really think that‚Äôs a point against Cage as Superman, unless the suggestion is Cage as a traditional adaptation of Superman.",1
"So basically Elfman knows *now*, what we knew back in May 2017. Close to nothing...",3
If that's true then why the hell is Snyder leading #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement?   I find it hard to believe he doesn't know anything about WB's meddling,3
It's also worth noting he said Whedon was brought in on days notice which contradicts WBs official statements,3
"He probably should have just not said anything.  Regardless of whether Snyder was fired or left on his own accord, the point is that the studio used his tragedy to completely overhaul his film in its entirety while lying and saying its still ‚ÄòZack‚Äôs Vision‚Äô.   They need to respect their director and let him come out with the movie he intended.  #releasethesnydercut",3
A man who came in and massively changed the existing work doesn't understand the issue with massively changing the existing work.  No vast surprise there.,3
"The problem isn‚Äôt that he was fired, Danny. It is that his work was fucked with real bad by the studio.",3
What Elfman did to the JL score was appalling. At least TRY to pretend to be part of an established universe.  Hearing the elfman and Williams scores pop up all of a sudden was so damn jarring.,3
Elfman does his best to further alienate himself from DC fans,2
Elfman disproved of Zacks movies anyways. He thought that you should never drop his themes from movies.   He feels his work was iconic,3
This guy made the worst score I‚Äôve heard in the past 10 years,3
He doesn‚Äôt quite understand giving Batman another theme when his theme is the correct and only one.,3
"Danny, you've made some of my favourite film scores of all time. However, you're just making me dislike you more and more. Please refrain from speaking about something you don't know much about.",2
"lol someone's misinformed. I still don't get how some people's argument against this movie is that the theatrical JL was bad. That's partially the point of people wanting the SnyderCut. Lol it's gonna be night and day. And if you didn't like MoS or BvS or any of Snyder's other work, than it's just not for you. Nobody's forcing anyone to see this.   And on a side note, when/if they release this, that should be the end of it. It'll end on cliffhangers and raise questions that will never go answered. WB/DC are moving forward in a brighter direction imo. No need to muddle the waters anymore. Just release it to appease fans and leave it at that.   As much as I enjoy MoS and BvS:UE, the movies still aren't all that good. If they're interested in Snyder making something, just make it a DC Black film and let him do his thing. No holds barred. Just don't spend $250M on it.   Affleck doesn't need to come back and I doubt that he wants too. Cavill wants too and if anyone can bring him into the fold, it's JJ and The Rock and Dany/Hiram Garcia. They're about to produce one of the three insanely intriguing DC films of 2021 and there's no way Black Adam won't be huge. That year, along with 2019 and 2020, is showcasing what DC/WB wants to do. DISTINCTION.",2
"He's just as clueless as the rest of us, but seemed to appear more dignified this time round.",2
Is he a moron?,2
"I don't believe Snyder was fired.  But I do think it got to the point where the studio let him know that the final product would be very different than what he originally envisioned, so he decided to walk away after the tragedy.",1
Is he lying or just ignorant?,2
I mean technically he was,1
https://media1.tenor.com/images/505de5fd52baa9a0db774a246dac8074/tenor.gif?itemid=9280717,1
Listen the end product sucked but WB owns everything Snyder filmed and that‚Äôs the way studios do business. Many films throughout history have always had large interference by the studio. It sucks but it‚Äôs not new.,1
"All due respect Danny, shut the fuck up you ignorant slut.",0
He was fired. Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves.,0
"After everything that's come out recently, 80 pages of new script etc., Momoa's input on it's level of completion, this has to be the most clueless input on the topic from someone involved with the project in a long, long time.",3
But he was fired.,3
People would have loved it if Snyder had done them. In fact this sub loved them being present when the movie released,0
Elfman is pretty arrogant,3
Preach. It was awful.,3
The composition wasn‚Äôt that bad. I enjoyed some of it. It was just where it sat in the mix. Can barely hear it at times.,2
"I think the problem was that it was a rush job, there‚Äôs no way he could‚Äôve made something good in that short amount of time. And the fact he didn‚Äôt have a finished version of that movie to score to, only story boards. It isn‚Äôt his fault tbh.",1
i was ok with his score.the batman score when he was on the roof was great in my opinion.,0
How does the guy who was hired to score the thing not know much about it? This is ridiculous.,1
"REleqsing it and shutting the fans up would be the sensible, simple solution.  But WB really are intent on being the biggest cunts possible.",2
Or he's telling the truth. Why is it people here think they know more than the people connected,0
Typical PR response,2
Technically he's just repeated what was released to us way back when. He'd hardly bash his own work and act like there was another movie (which there is apparently).,2
"And yet I wouldn't be surprised if it gets reported on more than anything else.    ""See? Elfman says there is no finished Snyder cut! I've been saying this for 2 years now!"" - John Campea among others \[likely\]",2
"His name is on the movie. They marketed it as his movie. If they wanted to man up, fire him, and change the movie, fine. You save yourself maybe 20% of a headache. The fervor derives in part from WB lying, using his stepping down due to personal tragedy as a cover, saying he picked Whedon to direct minimal scenes.",3
"Read my post again, slowly.",1
"I liked those moments in the score, sure, but I didn't like the way that Elfman shat on everyone who came after him.",1
"You're not wrong. It'd be ""I love how Snyder slipped in the original batman score there""",0
For good reason. But at the same time go ahead and fuck off and dont feel some type of way when people want to try something fresh. Something of their own design.,3
I mean for good reason. I don't care for JL but that was a very tight amount of time. Everything else he's done is pretty iconic,1
"We'll definitely see at least 5 clickbait articles for the same garbage ""news sites"" saying how this proves there's no Snyder cut and how everyone's just abusive and entitled.",2
"That's not how it works. I believe he was fired and in the movie industry no one says they fired a director, it's always like ""creative differences"" and such shit, in this case they used his daughter and since they are making a contract they can't even talk about it. Of course if it's a big thing that a director did they'd say they fired like when they did with James Gunn over pedo shit. But if the case is ""creative differences"" they don't say so the movie don't look bad, they need to do a good marketing. I wouldn't go to a movie which had a fired guy.",2
"His name being on the movie is more complicated. Credit arbitration is a weird thing, like Snyder could have asked for an Alan Smithee credit, but he'd have to go through a bunch of hoops to request it, and even then it could be rejected.",1
I know all this.,1
Outside of the Alfred line people loved the batman roof chase until they learned it was whedon,1
"This man is connected to the movie. It's entirely possible all mamoa seen was a original rough edit of the film. The person who is tasked with watching and scoring the film would be a lot more in the know of what was completed. (Other than Zack of course, but he conveniently has never Even said there is a full finished copy) Even if people here would rather shit on Danny, he knows more than we do.",1
"It certainly is a more complicated situation that we could ever know. No way on Earth is he requesting an anonymous credit in this day and age. It's not some straight to VHS movie from the 90s. WB could've Solo'd it, in retrospective. I imagine Zack even might prefer it, he went home and let them write their narrative in silence. They could've delayed it to the old Solo spot. For me it all comes back to WB messing up at every point.",1
"For real. There are so many threads on here that after I end up feeling like I'm in r/Snyder or something. It's ridiculous the blind faith people have.   But I guess it's fair, it's hope and that's what superman is about",1
"While I agree with your sentiment, I HIGHLY doubt Elfman saw anything from the original cut - For the most part, why would he in the first place? The original cut is completely wrong for his music, and they definitely didn't have his score before or during the reshoots, so there's not really any logical reason he'd have seen the original cut. He was ostensibly scoring a different movie.  Momoa's quote when quizzed on the cut really makes me believe otherwise, as well. He gets directly asked about it, with the interviewer mentioning that the Snyder cut wouldn't be finished and has plenty of CGI and Momoa basically starts grinning cheek to cheek   ""Oh you think, you think Zack couldn't finish his film"",   ""I don't know, you tell me""  ""Well, you know that's the question isn't it""  Then he goes on to joke he might be fired for even saying that.  Any more and he'd be breaking his NDA. No hate to Elfman, man has done amazing work that I love, but I don't really care about his opinion - his job was to make a soundtrack last minute for a heavily re-edited film, I really don't think he had enough insider info to be countering what basically every other source who actually worked on the cut we're discussing has said.",1
Fandral and Hogun have moved up in the world since last time they met Thor.,3
"To be completely honest i haven‚Äôt ever thought that Zack is bigger than Chris,i am surprised.",1
I don't see Christopher Lambert in there,1
"Holy shit, Shazam WAS Fandral, wasn't he??? Just now realizing this.",3
"I always thought that Hemsworth didn‚Äôt look huge in his appearances as Thor. I mean, he‚Äôs not small by any means, but he never looked like a huge dude to me.",2
Yeah he got that big frame,1
He was in Thor 2 or 3 I think? I remember that it wasn't Zach as Fandral in Thor 1,2
To me quite the contrary.his look in thor 3 can go toe to toe with Henry Cavill in the witchen.,1
"Both 2 and 3, although his appearance in 3 was quite short.",1
"He was going to play the part in Thor 1 but he had to film Chuck so Josh Dallas (David/Prince Charming in Once Upon a Time) played the role. Dallas had to film Once Upon a Time during Thor 2, so Levi played the role of Fandral.",1
"Damn yeah, the friends of Thor made a super quick appearance in Ragnarok...",2
I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôd watch Christoph Waltz play anyone.,3
That'd be _cool_,3
"We for sure need a mr freeze, and i am not against that pick.",3
"In a another world, he would made a perfect Joker",3
"I always thought Giancarlo Esposito would be a great Mr. Freeze. In Breaking Bad he plays cold and calculating really well, while also being gentle and understanding.",3
He‚Äôs not a bad choice at all   I‚Äôve always wanted to see Stanley Tucci or Michael Fassbender try the part.,3
So he can just freeze the stairs and waltz into the Batcave?,3
"He'd do great as a lot of Batman's villains, but this especially.",2
I actually think he should get a solo movie in the same style as Joker.  Truly a character with a tragic fall who we could all relate to.,2
Call me crazy but I‚Äôd like to see Arnold get another shot at it. I think in the right context it could really work without being campy. Cut the dialogue way back. Make him Austrian and have him speak to his frozen wife in his native tongue. A quiet genius. He‚Äôd be old but his physicality and desperation would make the character very threatening.,3
I'd watch him play cat woman. Dude can do anything.,2
I want Brian Cranston honestly.,1
"I really like the idea of villains having different accents than just American, so this intrigues me.",1
Depends. Inglorious Basterds waltz or specter waltz?,1
"Waltz is exemplary in every role he‚Äôs in, but I have a hard time imagining him as Mr Freeze.  Although, most of the cast in this movie is intentionally challenging the norm of these characters so I‚Äôd be open to his interpretation of this character.",1
Is Reeves getting a trilogy?,1
Werner Herzog!!!,1
Maybe a better one:  Christoph Waltz as Lionel Luthor. Lex did say in BvS that his father was born in East Germany.,1
"He'd be great.  There's a lot of great people who could play the role, but Waltz would be a hell of a choice.",1
That‚Äôs a bingoooo,1
I‚Äôd be happy even if Christoph Waltz was cast as Diana Prince,1
I said that on another post a week ago.,1
make him black you bigot,1
Yes. Someone needs to make this happen,1
"Yes because as far as acting is concerned, Christoph Waltz can do no wrong",1
Perfect cast,1
Waltz would be great. He can play anything with how versatile he is.  I've always wanted Ralph Fiennes for the role though.,1
"Waltz would be good, but I want Benedict Cumberbatch to be Mr. Freeze.",1
No. Keep him away.    I'd say go with /u/GovSchwarzenegger.,1
He will do a great riddler.,1
"You are aware of what they call me, yes? Ze bat Hunter.",1
I think he'd be a good  *Commissioner* James Gordon just grow out that mustache thicker and would be pretty close to him comic likeness .   With Jeffery Wright as either Lucius Fox or Crispus Allen & partner to Renee Montoya and especially if they move towards a Broken City storyline this could be great to see with Jeffery playing this role .,1
"Oooooooo, That's a bingo!",1
Waltz would be great. What does everyone think about Bryan Cranston though?,1
"I dunno, we all remember what happened last time an Austrian played Freeze...",1
"As much as I love that man, I think Christopher Heyerdahl would nail the role.",1
Always thought he'd make a great magneto,1
"Personally, I always saw Tobin Bell as the next live action version of Freeze.",1
Now when they cast someone else it‚Äôs gonna piss me off,1
This is how you know itll never happen,1
i honestly would shit myself if he was mr freeze. they both have the same energy lol.,1
My personal fan-cast for Mr Freeze is Michael Fassbender but now you've put the idea in my head I have no doubts that Christoph Waltz would kill it in the role and I would like to see that.,1
This is perfect.,1
"Yes, but my #1 choice is Bryan Cranston.",1
Can we just get this as an origin story and not crammed into an already packed Batman movie??,1
"This might get me a lot of downvotes, I don't know, but I've always thought he'd play an awesome Joker, lmao.",1
"I would want them to go a little younger Freeze for Pattinson's Batman, but it would have been awesome to see Affleck go up against Waltz as Freeze.",1
Na bring back Arnie ! WHAT KILLED THE DINOSAURS!!!!! ü¶ïü¶ñ,1
I never thought about this but it‚Äôs perfect,1
That would be perfect?,1
He‚Äôs so icy,1
"He‚Äôs awesome, love him, would be great",1
"I see your Christoph Waltz Mr. Freeze, and I raise you Christoph Waltz Dr. Doom ü§ìüòé",1
I‚Äôd think he‚Äôd be better as Brainiac.,1
I think Arnold Schwarzenegger would be the perfect choice.,1
"I actually had this idea in a class the other day. Glad to see others agree, ‚Äòcause it‚Äôd be amazing.",1
My second favorite German.,1
"yes, 100 percent  i could watch him act all day he‚Äôs so talented",1
"""Mr.Batman, You scale the mountains because you are not afraid of it, you slay the criminals because you are not afraid of it, and you cross through fire because it's worth it."" Mr. Freeze",1
I‚Äôd love it,1
This would be super good!! I feel like he can add the darkness of Mr. Freeze well while making it his own. Would love to see this!,1
could be cool. or fassbender maybe.,1
"I want Mr Freeze but I mean there have already been so many major comic book characters casted and now Carmine Falcon and this is only for the first movie, maybe in the 2nd or 3rd.",1
Nah. He always plays the same guy. I don‚Äôt want Hans Landa as Mr Freeze.,1
Sylvester Stallone is the only real choice.,0
He would be a great Ras Al Ghoul,0
Von freeze,0
horrible idea.  He is way too animated..  He would be better for a Riddler.   You need someone dark and cold to play Mr Freeze,0
"I don't understand the title of this post.  Fan-cast... so NOT cast at all, just some people on the internet,  now asking other people on the internet?  Whatever. I like him.",0
"Don't do this to me! Don't give me hope. Do you have any idea how fucking loud I was when screamed watching this? I legit thought he was casted and I just lost it.  Side note though: just having him in the movie would be bloody amazing. Till then, Ah Revoir!",0
WOulD yOu lIkE ThiS cAStInG. Christoph Waltz could be Batman with a German accent and I‚Äôd still like it.,0
I thought fan-casting posts were not allowed on this sub? They don‚Äôt serve any real purpose. When is the last time a fan-cast was actually accurate?,0
Christopher Waltz as Catwoman.,3
seriously hes one of those actors that improves any movie he is in.  I even enjoyed him as blofeld in Spectre,2
100% this. He has destroyed every role I have seen him play. He made the green hornet watchable and that says a lot.,1
Icy what you did there.,3
Very nICE,3
Hey everyone  #chill,1
*What killed the dinosaurs?*,1
That was my thought too. Or Harvey Dent if he was younger,3
Ooh he‚Äôd be really good,3
Hell yes that's good casting. I retract my other suggestion.,1
"I remember thinking that too! It could be a total flip on Fring's character- with Mr. Freeze being outwardly cold, while he has an internal warmth and love to him.",1
Oh man. Tucci would be incredible.,3
"Timothy Dalton, Jason Isaacs",2
"I agree with Tucci, he would be a better fit",1
Both of those would be fantastic choices but I think I‚Äôd have to lean toward [Tucci](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw5NG580rBk),1
"I have a similar opinion about George Clooney as batman. I thought Clooney could have been the best actor to play Bruce Wayne if put in the right situation. He was tall, handsome, had a great voice, and he could portray bruce in a way that didn‚Äôt come off as pompous. I thought he was as close as you could get to a real life version of the cartoons voiced by Kevin Conroy, which I love how Bruce Wayne is portrayed. It would be cool to see him reprise the role of Bruce but in batman beyond. Also, I think it would be cool if Terry McGinnis was played by asian guy. Obviously have to change his last name but I think that would be a bold choice.",3
Honestly Arnold is a much better actor than he gets credit for.,2
You‚Äôre crazy.,2
What killed the dinosaurs though?,2
Just a cold menacing brute,1
It was originally supposed to be Patrick Stewart apparently.,1
Alita Waltz ?,2
A black villain? Are you trying to imply african americans are evil? /s,2
Idris Elba as Freeze?,1
"Black Freeze? Black Ice. But nah for real, Freeze might be more effective as a pale narrow nose dude.  A white actor with Idris Elba skill. Like a Joel Edgerton or Tom Hiddleston. Anybody can be freeze though, as long as he inhabits the values. Johnny Depp has been my Go To after Black Mass.",1
"To be fair, he can be cast and it just locks him in for the future movie with like a cameo in this one.",1
yeah he is too animated and charming to be Mr Freeze,1
Yes. 10/10 would bang.,3
"""There's nothing gendered about a sexy cat.""",3
"it‚Äôs just christoph, btw.",1
"I loved him in spectre, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen him play a bad role, like you say he‚Äôs one of those that just instantly makes something better. Abit like Denzel imo.",1
Bloodnofsky.,1
_Chill_,3
THE ICE AGE,1
I think you give him a little hair dye and blammo perfect Harvey Dent,2
Those aren‚Äôt bad either. I‚Äôve wanted Isaacs or Oded Fehr to play Ra‚Äôs Al Ghul.,2
Half Asian Terry would be great and could still fit in with the JLU twist with Clooney as Batman. Also I wouldn‚Äôt rule out the existence of full Asian looking people with an Irish name in the not too distant future (source: am Asian have Scottish name),3
Clooney‚Äôs only problem was that he didn‚Äôt understand the divide between Batman and Bruce Wayne. He had the alter ego down but forgot to flip the switch when he suited up. You can partially blame the script because Batman and Bruce both had identical dialogue. Clooney didn‚Äôt have much to work with.,3
"I mean, given Terry‚Äôs later reveal I‚Äôd say that making half Asian with a white dad would probably be the better choice if they went that route, so he could probably keep the last name.",1
Clooney would be a great Falcone if he hadn't already been Batman once. John will kill it though.,1
He's a far better actor than Sylvester Stallone for sure.,2
"Here‚Äôs my number. Call me, maybe,",1
[Because you touch yourself at night](https://youtu.be/W23LKD9Z1hw),1
The Green Hornet Waltz.,1
I don‚Äôt speak Spanish.,0
are you trying to imply that I meant African Americans because they are the only black people worth mentioning? /s,1
I wanna see Johnny Depp as the riddler,1
But would he want to bang you ?,3
Charles Boyle as CatPerson!,1
Oded Fehr as Ra's Al Ghul? Hell yeah.,2
Isaacs as Ras is a solid pick,1
You prolly know this but Oded Fehr voices Ra‚Äôs in Young Justice,1
I definitely blame Joel Schumacher for that dumpster fire of a movie. The writer of the script was to blame as well. I don‚Äôt think you can put it on any of the actors in the movie. They have little control of things you mentioned.,2
Tbh the theme of Batman and Bruce Wayne finally sharing a life was the main idea of Forever. B&R was a spiritual sequel to that. Not in the least defending B&R tho.,1
He was really good in Dark Fate. You can tell he‚Äôs playing T2 T800 rather than Genysis.,1
Yup. And Isaacs played him in Under the Red Hood.   They both did a good job.,1
Schumacher had no control by the end of production,1
"Yes, I thought that was isaacs!  Agreed",1

Man Leto‚Äôs joker looks so good in white suits,3
#Releasetheayercut,3
Despite how awesome all the other cinematic iterations are of Joker. I really liked Leto's as well.,3
I unabashedly love this Joker.,3
Love how the ‚ÄúDamaged‚Äù tattoo is cropped out,2
Really hate the aesthetic of this movie,3
"Literally everything that could‚Äôve gone wrong when designing the Joker, did go wrong.",3
Stop teasing us like this and release the Ayer Cut.,1
"Man I respect going in a new direction, and feel as though Ayer got kinda screwed over not having the proper time to develop and interference and all that but, those are hideous costumes lol",3
clown and Queen,2
"They look great, so much potential wasted unfortunately.",3
I LOOOOOOVE that Joker design so much. Its so creepy and cool.   I dont get why people who hate it need to comment on it. I hated Shazam and I don‚Äôt even click on Shazam related posts. You guys have super boring lives that you need to focus on shit you did NOT like?!^^,3
Wow what a Power couple. Do they have a Instagram?,1
Leto's Joker has the best clothes hands down. He is like the typical modern day rapper + oldie gangsters vibes all in one!,0
More like the king and queen of my toilet,1
King and queen of Gotham. That is so stupid.,0
NOOO!!! You're giving me nightmares looking at that horrible Joker,0
Take away those tattoos and I honestly enjoyed the joker that we got (for a very short time) in there.,0
I‚Äôm da joker baby.,2
yo can u tell me why i can‚Äôt post on this sub? i sent u guys a message but none of the mods answered me. i need a post flair but then can‚Äôt choose one??,0
What a waste,3
√† la TDK Returns,1
"Also, the aesthetics was the least of it's problems.",2
Its so random. Watches on your upper arm? Come on.,3
His suits are on point,3
Eh. I would say the grill actually makes his teeth even more unnerving and stand out more,3
*damaged*,0
>I dont get why people who hate it need to comment on it.  Because thats what a comment section is for? To comment and give opinions..?,3
"I think the most concise way someone has summed up my opinion on Leto's Joker is when they were talking about Phoenix's Joker movie: ""Why didn't Joker have 'Mental Illness' tattooed on his forehead?""",3
"If you 'love this joker design' and 'hated Shazam', you may be from the dark alternative universe where everything is reverse and life is awful.",3
Same reason you need to comment on it.,2
You prob like to drink OJ after you brush your teeth too.,1

‚ÄúNegative Thoughts‚Äù in fancy cursive,3
It came up on my feed,2
Ok but why take the effort to customize the watches so they would be big enough to fit around your bicep? And then actually wear it?,3
That‚Äôs a necessary theory,1
"I mean, we're talking about Harley Quinn, here. Her fashion sense is... quirky. I guess a guy would just wear the watch normally; Harley's made them into bracelets.  For Joker and Harley in this movie, they took a lot of inspiration from real life Mexican cartel leaders and their gangs. Here's a quote from the costume designer:  >What kind of real-world research did you do, outside of referencing the comics? > >*We spent a lot of time looking up drug cartel auction websites, and Mexican drug lords were doing a lot on Instagram at that time. All of the guns and accessories very much came from that world.* > >How did that inspire you specifically? > >*There‚Äôs just such excess in this underground world, you wouldn‚Äôt believe the reality of some of it. There‚Äôs even a female gangster who had a pink machine gun. It‚Äôs kind of suburban, weirdly, but taken to extremes. I was at Warner Bros. working while the Mexican government was auctioning off all their Rolexes and guns and shit like that. And I said, ‚ÄúI have to bid on that!‚Äù  And of course Warner Bros. blocked me from bidding on any of it. So we made it instead.*    I'd guess the watches are like a status symbol thing, for intimidation or whatever - ""See how many gangsters I've whacked? You could be next, puddin'!""  There's a scene in the novelization of the film where Captain Boomerang steals a Rolex off one of Enchantress's minions after their first encounter with them (remember how they were all regular people who'd been transformed by her magic) and Harley asks if she can have it to add to her collection.",3
i thought they were those stretchy watches,1
"Which is why I hated this movie. Too much gangster inspired sht because of Ayer. They‚Äôre criminals, not gangsters.",2
"**Note:** Boss Logic was also the first to say Pattinson would be cast as Batman, and he's got friends in the industry. Coincidence or perhaps something more than pure coincidence?",3
"A man can dream, but I'm not getting my hopes up",3
I do really like Cavill as Superman though I haven't seen Justice League. I like him as Superman and I like him as an actor. Want to see him stay in the role.,3
Can‚Äôt wait to hear what ja rule thinks,3
"Do you know what the ""S"" stands for?",1
"On my world, it means hope.",2
He doesn't know anything,2
Henry is not leaving.,1
It amazes me how a Photoshop Fan-Edit dude now has friends in Hollywood and inside scoop.,1
"I have a cousin who works at Endeavor and I asked him bluntly, Is Cavil out as MoS and his answer was ""LOL yea right, their is a reason why the head of WB got sacked one of them is his sex scandal the other one is Dany Garcia...",0
"BossLogic made an edit of Pattinson as Batman earlier this year, in like February. [Here's a link](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtbDv6RA8v3/). He said that he was ""hearing some background chatter"" about Pattinson being looked at for the part. So he didn't say that he absolutely *would* get the part, but it definitely gives credence to him possibly having industry sources. I hope this comment from today is based on stuff he is hearing. I want MoS 2.",3
It‚Äôs very interesting,2
He doesn‚Äôt know.,3

I need some answers Ja just can‚Äôt give me right now!,2
So you know BossLogic huh???,0
WHAT?????,2
"Imo, he definetly has sources.Actually...not sources. Acquaintances. Colleagues. Or Clients idk. But he is still the guy that worked with Jim Lee to make a teaser image for Black Adam which was first shared by The Rock. So chances are he talked with Jim Lee, The Rock And The Rock‚Äôs team, which is also Henry‚Äôs team.",3
I dont want to dance im scared to death!,1
Well considering he's never broken any news ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,3
Does bosslogic really know anything lol,2
[Weeeeellll...](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtbDv6RA8v3/),2
He knows how to make some pretty awesome fan-posters,1
Everyone had Pattinson as the favorite when the shortlist was announced,0
He also makes official content for studios   I think he made some MCU posters and definitely knows people on the industry,2
He was cast on May iirc and the post is from february,1
Look at the month,1
"Not even close. He's commissioned just like any other independent graphic artist would be. As far as I'm aware was only brought on to do a one-off for Marvel one time. He doesn't know inside information outside of whatever assets he's given when doing design work that would potentially be spoilers for everyone else, and even then there could be some kind of NDA.  He doesn't have access to some deep information that some of you think he does.  90% of his work is mediocre at best and doesn't reflect the skill most professionals have in their portfolio after the same amount of time he's been at this. Big reason why you're not seeing him do more ""official content for studios"". All he's doing and continues to do is fan art. Bring mentioned by celebrities here and there doesn't mean he knows people in the ""industry"". If he did, he would be much further ahead than he is.",0
"Calm down, jealous tough guy.",1
"I'm not sure where or when he confirmed it, but I believe Zack Snyder himself said that Superman never wore the black suit in the movie.",3
Looks like it‚Äôs just a tribute to the suit using BvS models.,3
"It's a BvS toy and is likely just a repaint so they can make more money for the mold they've used, I doubt this has anything to do with the SC",3
"Jesus, that suit is majestic",2
This is not a Snyder Cut toy. This already came out months ago and you can find them on Ebay right now. This post is very misleading.,1
Great find! That suit is beyond awesome! I'd love to see something like that in one of the films someday.,2
Lol they are selling the Superman jl hot toys for 600 bucks. What kind of website is this?,1
"Although the Snyder Cut doesn't include the black suit, it likely was supposed to originally.  I mean, there's no reason for Cavill to tease that photo of it if it's not part of the resurrection plot somehow.  I don't think he would just do that to be a dick.    I still believe however, that the original plan for JL (before BvS came out) was to bring Superman back evil in the first place.  Hence Geoff ""Snake"" Johns saying we ""accelerated the story to get to the hope and optimism faster.""",1
Michael Wilkinson is the one that confirmed that the black suit was scrapped during production.,3
Kind of. IIRC He almost chooses to wear the black suit but then decides to keep wearing the brighter colors.  [yeah he turns away from it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWgQtaVQn7w),2
Incorrect. Kevin Smith interviewed someone who watched Zack's cut in March or April who said either steppenwolf or darkseid try to use the anti life force to turn Superman. Supermans suit turns black as he almost comes under the influence of the anti life but he resist to snap out of it. So the black suit from man of steel returned briefly in that moment.,3
"Not my intention to mislead, I just found the figure and seem the release date. Thanks for letting me know. Love your work u/WhiplashDynamo",1
Maybe we will.ü§ûü§û,2
Fine by me. That evil Superman idea sucked from the start,1
Didn't Kevin say it was Green Lantern Alfred met despite it being Supes,1
"Thank you! Appreciate the kind words. Hopefully a real line of figures based on Snyder's JL does come out. Knightmare Flash, Battle Mode Cyborg w/multiple arms and the BvS Steppenwolf",1
"I like the contrast between the bat emblem and the suit.  If I have one nitpick about Affleck's Batsuit is that the bat emblem is barely darker than the suit, it doesn't allow this kind of contrast between them.",3
Looks good,2
"Wow, I like, REALLY like this. I‚Äôve never been a fan of the undies, but they actually look good here. It just fits the suit. The cowl is cool, the blue and grey looks fantastic, the logo is new and nice looking. Great job man! I would love to see something like this in the film",2
I think the lenses need to be a bit more angular. I don't like the idea of something that looks like white contacts. It should be an angular design akin to the comics.,1
Looks great. Trunks are gonna be a tough sell though.,2
I‚Äôd rather he be Solomon Grundy,3
"I want a Latino Bane. Why do people just cast a big guy as Bane, he‚Äôs not naturally big he‚Äôs big because he‚Äôs amped up off Venom.",3
The problem is he can't act. We need someone who can pull of being and intelligent villain not just be huge,3
"I would like a big guy or CGI for Venom Bane. And then have either Pedro PAscal, Oscar Issac or Javier Bardem to voice and play non venom bane",2
I want an Arkham Origins Bane,2
"Physically, sure. If he's going to keep the mask on, he should be dubbed over by someone Latin (or who can at least do a Hispanic accent.)  Personally, I think he'd make a better Solomon Grundy. We haven't seen that villain in movies yet.",3
This guy could do a great physical role with someone else doing the voice (Ala Darth Vader)   Honestly with all we've heard on The Batman though i think it'd be fun to see him as Grundy  He's got the build and the accent can still make it work,2
"Getting tired of this ""he has to be a Latino"" thing.  He is the son of an english man, born in a ficticious jail, in a ficticious country.",2
Bane isn't white,2
Really wanted to see Batfleck vs BaneBj√∂rn,1
"Thats a horrible choice :D  ‚Äúlets get a giant bodybuilder who can‚Äôt act for Bane!‚Äù Shows that most of u you people don‚Äôt really get Bane. Its not about size, its about menace and intelligence. Tom Hardy nailed the part and is only 5‚Äô10, but looked huge in the film.",1
Physically ? martin ford is much better but you gotta have an actor as in someone who can act,1
*cough* Dave Bautista *cough*,1
That guy who played Viktor Drago in Creed 2 would be a perfect Bane,1
"If they did something like they did with Armie and the Winklevoss' I could see it working - in my head Bane is at peak athletic condition, the venom pushes him into superhuman strength and durability - and Bjornsson's body type.",0
"The film won't come out until 2021, this shut turns me insane. If the DCEU started well at the start, we would've gotten something like the batman before 2020 for Ben, but no fuck this shit.",0
"His accent could be a good take on grundy, I‚Äôm all for it",3
"Depends on the the writer but there are plenty of times where he is just a naturally huge dude. Plus there will probably be a scene where he gets amped up, easier to CGI muscles on to an already muscle-y dude.",3
Dave Bautista is too perfect for the role,3
"Well, Bane does wear a mask 9.5/10 of the time. They could hire this big ass bro and have Javier Bardem or Benicio Del Toro voice him.  Hell, probably Hector Elizondo since I love his voicework on Bane from Mystery of the Batwoman. Maybe Danny Trejo who did a good job on Young Justice.",1
"I have to disagree, when given the chance he did a lot better than expected in Game of Thrones, and he was fantastic in a role in 'Operation Ragnarok' a short film.",0
"I was thinking a voice over from Pedro Pascal, but he is already in WW84 :(",2
"There was another comment thread where we were talking abt potential voices: Pedro Pascal, Javier Bardem.   I think The Batman will not use Grundy, but I agree it‚Äôd be really cool to see him do Grundy",2
"Seriously. I‚Äôm Hispanic and I really couldn‚Äôt care less. I didn‚Äôt relate to him or feel any happier when I saw him in TAS and heard his accent. Shit, I know of no Hispanics that felt offended that Hardy was Bane. But maybe some people do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2
He's dressed as a Luchador and he hails from *Santa Prisca*. White washing him does a disservice to the many themes of the character,1
Someone better tell Tom Hardy,3
"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs definitive.   He‚Äôs born in a and raised in a Latin country, but IIRC we only know the identity of his father, and he was Caucasian.   With that said, I do think he should be Latino, as his overall appearance and upbringing suggests that.",2
"His dad is white, he could easily take after him.",2
"r/iamverysmart much? How about my reasoning is ‚Äòhe is a huge guy who fits Banes body type and has promising acting skills. With some proper coachiand guidance he would make a fantastic Bane. Also I would argue that Bane is a two pronged threat, he is extremely intelligent and hard to outwit, and is an immensely skilled fighter with superhuman strength. That‚Äôs why it is more of a difficult task to defeat him. Just like brawn, brains isn‚Äôt everything.",1
"Tom is 5'9""",1
"yeah I agree, but it was a different mindset back in 2014-ish. MCU was still on the up and not quite the juggernaut it is now, so by the time DC had already started turning the wheels on their 'catch-up' plan it was too late. But atleast they are trying to make something out of the rubble instead of entirely abandoning everything, also a change of management helps",1
"Actually no  In the comics Bane is just naturally huge (Venom just amped his strength, it didn't Hulk him out) although that seems to be added in a bit  Plus he's the exact height Hafthor is funnily enough",3
"Not latino, but great actor",1
The guy barely speaks English and in GoT was mostly a physical presence.,3
That's not an issue. Patrick Wilson voiced POTUS in BVS and also played Ocean Master and Djimon Hounsou played The Wizard in Shazam and King Ricou in Aquaman.,3
Javier Bardem,2
Yes.  This right here.,1
Well if we go by Halloween we may see him  But yeah those voices are good bets (Would love Bardem as Darkseid as well),1
"Same here. We don't need ""representation"". We have our own world of TV shows, Movies and culture. Why would we give a shit about a ficticious country being represented hahaha",1
"I'm Latino and was pretty bothered that Nolan white washed Batman's few ethnic villains (Ra's included). I loved Hardy in that rendition since it's fiction and it doesn't have to be completely accurate, especially with Nolan's take. However, now that we're being more inclusive in casting nowadays, accurate representation matters. He's dressed as a damn Luchador, make him Latino",1
"Santa Prisca doesn't exist, amigo mio. You can't white wash him. He is white.",1
It was white washing then too.,2
Bane was whitewash in the tdkr,0
"I constantly hear the ""they could still take after their white parent!"" argument, but people never seem to use it correctly. Basically, this actor is white and not mixed at all. If ""The Mountain"" were mixed, like Bane, then your point would be valid.",1
Hopefully everything works out well and we manage to get a proper justice league film before 2023.,1
"I have only ever seen him as huge in the comics, but I also like to look at other forms of media, because filmmakers take from so many sources.  Keeping that in mind, he is a small guy in The Batman (2004) and in Batman and Robin (1997) But yeah I‚Äôve never seen him small in the comics",1
"Yeah sure, he was mostly a physical threat sure, but still had his moments, also idk where you are getting that his English is bad, he is very fluent, also he hid his accent very well in GoT",0
"I suppose if one role is visual and the other is entirely auditory, then it wouldn't be, thank you friend you've given me hope (also didn't know Pat was the POTUS in BVS)",3
Javier as Darkseid tho,2
"This, I like this",1
"I really think TLH is gonna be even more than just inspiration. However with that in mind, I think that a lot of the villains are going to be different, I think someone may replace Grundy (or just omit his small role from the story). I still would like a live action Grundy in the DCEU, maybe as a small villain in multiple movies, with a redemption story a la Justice League Unlimited.    Also as much as I would love to see Bardem take on Darkseid, I think Darkseid technically already has a voice actor, I do not remember his name though.",1
"I assume you have problems with James Gordon being black, then? And why not Selina Kyle being played by a hispanic?",1
"If the Luchador getup isn‚Äôt reason enough for people, then there‚Äôs no convincing anyone haha ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1
"Too be fair Tom Hardy was portraying a Bane who was not meant to be Latino but rather be of Middle Eastern descent, so I believe in the case of TDKR he was meant to be Levant",2
"not really, he was meant to be middle eastern not Latin America, so he was most likely Levantine",1
"Yes, this. Casting a white actor for a non-white role is white-washing, even if one is using the ‚Äúthey could be white-passing‚Äù argument.",1
But then I constantly hear that ‚ÄúBane should be Latino!‚Äù. So it‚Äôs ok to cast a Latino actor but not a white one and they suddenly forget that he‚Äôs mixed.,0
"I think it would be a little later, I think building the universe more, and focusing on alot more characters is the way to go. Marvel has to rely alot on their crossovers because they don‚Äôt have the vast bank of interesting characters and stories that DC has, I‚Äôm fine with a wait for JL if weget more great solo films like AM and WW",1
I‚Äôm not sure referencing Batman and Robin is a good way to make a point in any comic book argument.,2
He's huge in the Arkham and Telltale games as well but yeah they went more with the Hulk thing,1
>he hid his accent very well in GoT  I mean he's essentially mute,2
[Hope] It's all some people have.,1
Ray Porter was meant to be him in the Snyder Cut  Granted I doubt he'll actually do the role unless we get the Cut  Also you just reminded me of how much I loved Grundy in the DCAU,1
"Gordon‚Äôs character isn‚Äôt defined by his whiteness, so I don‚Äôt really have a problem with it. Hugo Strange in Gotham was Asian and he killed that role, I loved it. Bane‚Äôs iconography is heavily pulled from Luchadors, in dress, movement, and demeanor. It‚Äôs an iconic figure in Mexican culture that is a huge part of Bane‚Äôs character. It would‚Äôve been cool to see Selina be Latina, but again her ethnic/cultural background isn‚Äôt really essential to her character and her development so Zoe is great casting in my book.",1
Tom hardy isn't middle eastern so it's still whitewashing,1
"What about casting a non-white actor for a traditionally white role? Not trying to argue your point, white-washing is a problem, but Bane is Latin American, roughly 1/3 of people in Latin America identify as white. My point is White and LA are not mutually exclusive",1
"Yeah sounds much better. I'd love to see a shazam 2, green lantern, doctor date and solo flash film.",1
He spoke quite a bit before Strong   But yeah guy can do some acting,2
"Grundy was so much fun in every appearance, then that two part send off was just such a treat. I wish they would continue some of the old shows w/ their show runners on the streaming service. They all really loved the worlds and characters. anyway...  I am pretty sure we will get the cut sooner or later, however I think that the cut as well as a lot of stuff from the early DCEU will be void with a sort of universe wide 'soft reboot'.",1
But this dude is European. Nothing about him is going to look or sound Latin American.,1
"It depends. There are some traditionally white characters that can‚Äôt/shouldn‚Äôt be changed, but most non-white characters and non-European ethnic groups have much more explicit ties to their backgrounds than guys such as Johnny Storm.   But example, Bane‚Äôs ethnicity is somewhat ambiguous, but he‚Äôs associated with Latino culture. So even if Latinos can be white, casting a non-Hispanic white person would still be a form of white-washing.   It‚Äôs a lot trickier with Latinos and Hispanics, for sure, as there is no strict ties to a specific race.",1
"Well good news is all of those are in production (except DrFate, who is supposed to make an appearance in Black Adam, so expect a Fate solo film)",1
"You and I have different definitions of quite a bit. He asks ""Who am I fighting?"" and then says ""I raped her, I killed her and I murdered her children."" Outside of that, I'm not sure what else he says. That's not quite a bit.",1
Yeah (I can see some elements being there but yeah a lot of it is gonna be retconned or ignored),1
"like I said white (or in this case Icelandic) and LA are not mutually exclusive, he is good at hiding his accent, plus I imagine a mask on Bane is the way to go",0
"I disagree on saying that it is still a form of white-washing. If we were to apply that same logic, then one could say that casting Gerard Butler as Leonidas is white-washing, they are both white yes, but they are from different cultures (Scottish & Greek). I think we agree that when casting someone of a certain race/ethnicity for a role that revolves around a certain race/ethnicity it should remain pretty 1 for 1. For instance casting Simu Liu as Shang Chi.",0
I did say a bit,1
"The only stuff I can see getting retconned are some stuff from Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Justice League, I think most peoples Origins are gonna be more or less the same, with Batman being the biggest change, we just have to wait and see what they do with the Flash movie",1
Find me an Icelandic guy who is also Latin American and speaks with a Spanish accent,1
>He spoke quite a **bit** before Strong  Yes,1
Definitely yeah I feel JL's event are gonna be played with broad strokes but that's it,1
I guarantee you there is atleast one out there,1
No shit. Doesn‚Äôt make this good casting,1
"I agree. Overall, the Shazam! score is very underrated.",2
"*SHAZAM!* distinguished itself for me by harkening back to a time when a family film could contain a great deal of adversity alongside a large heart. While I found the main theme a bit lacking, I loved the atmospherics of Wallfisch's work, which I knew to expect coming off of his excellent music for New Line/WB's *IT.*",2
"He‚Äôs at the top of my list for any casting decision, tbh.",3
It could make for a VERY VERY refreshing take on Scarecrow,3
I'd prefer Domnhall Gleeson for Scarecrow,3
"He's a grear actor, Scarecrow would be a great fit. Victor Zasz would be right up his alley too",3
He would have been a great choice for Riddler.  Scarecrow though would be a really interesting choice though,3
He has a great face. I wouldn't want to put him under a mask for most of the film.,2
"i want cillian murphy again, his scarecrow didnt get enough attention",2
Adam Driver for me,2
He would be a good Firefly,1
That‚Äôs a cartoons though,1
"I'm out of this subreddit, I am so exhausted with these ""wouldn't actor x be a great x""."" Then whenever someone like me (who actually respects the source material) retorts with the blatantly obvious response, ""but that individual looks nothing like the character you want them to play."" There is a fucking woke dog pile, you people are either just trying to troll those of us with common sense and respect for the canon or you actually ascribe to the woke nonsense of identitarianism, in which case I genuinely worry for your mental health. Regardless I can't stand any more of this PC nonsense littering my Reddit feed.",1
Daniel Day Lewis would make a great scarecrow,1
Hes my choice for Reverse Flash.,1
No thanks. They've racebent enough characters already.,0
"Hear me out, Tom Hiddleston.",0
"he ruined the character of L, hate got think what he's gonna do with scarecrow without good direction",0
"He‚Äôs at the top of several people‚Äôs lists apparently. That guy is in everything lately.  That may be a bit of an exaggeration, but he definitely deserves it. He‚Äôs very talented",2
I think it fits with the type of casting we‚Äôve already seen .Who would‚Äôve imagined John Turturro in a Batman film,2
He‚Äôs great in Bojack Horseman and he‚Äôs a buffalo in that I think,2
Umm okay,1
This is hilarious thank you for such a horrible comment.,1
I mean his race doesn‚Äôt really define the character and he‚Äôll probably wear a mask most of the time that he‚Äôs on screen but ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2
Cuz everybody knows the most important characteristic of Dr. Johnathan Crane/Scarecrow is the color of his skin.   /s,3
Lakeith Stanfield as L was one of two good things about the Netflix Death Note.,1
I get your POV but most actors would do bad under bad direction and a bad script. If you never heard of death note beforehand and just saw the movie you might‚Äôve just been indifferent to his performance because he did well with what he was told to do.,1
FUCK   God damn it I'm mad I didnt notice,1

that was not L,1
Madlad gave 2 stars for fant4stic in his review.,3
He did get his movie destroyed by the studio too and I'd like to his cut.,3
#ReleaseTheSnyderCut  #ReleaseTheAyerCut  #ReleaseTheTrankCut  Fuck it...  #ReleaseTheLordandMillerCut,3
"The first two acts of Fant4stic Four is actually really good. The third act, beginning with ""one year later"" is clearly by another director's hand. And it's... not good. My guess is it was Simon Kinberg.",3
People are so easily triggered lol. Poor guys getting dragged in his own replies for calling Snyder legendary and iconic.,3
Fantastic 4 was actually really good for half the movie . It totally went south after that . Like REALLY REALLY SOUTH .,3
"If it's all the same to Fox & Warner, I'm in full support the Trank cut. I love what he was trying to do with that movie.",3
#releasethetrankcut,2
I'd love to see the Trank cut. The studio cut of the film showed a lot of promise.,2
Everyone supports Snyder.,1
Is there more to this?,2
Where can I read the rest of this?,1
"..cave, with a box of scraps",1
I love Trank. Both ironically and non-ironically.,1
üòÇüòÇüòÇ he said ICONIC and LEGENDARY filmmaker lol what movie did he direct that was iconic and legendary based on his directing skills?? I'll wait.,0
Agreed. There was promising moments/storylines that were present in the TC - would love to see the TrankCut,3
Maybe but from what I read his movie was never really The Fantastic Four. More like I'm gonna use this budget to sneak in Chronical II. Plus dude was a dick on set. Snyder is not that,2
And The Kinberg Cut,2
"I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again: the first 2/3‚Äôs of Fant4stic are part of a, pardon my pun, fantastic movie. As soon as that time jump happens, it just all falls apart. Sadly, people only seem to remember that part.  Edit: And the trailers support this. If we can get the Snyder Cut released, we can get the Trank Cut as well.",3
"Personally, I think that if the movie had a different third act and wasn't supposed to be a Fantastic Four movie, if, say, it was an independent sequel to Chronicle (like Split was for Unbreakable), it could have been amazing.",2
"No. Simon wasn't directing anything until Dark Phoenix, and Fox fucked him over there. Dark Phoenix was going to be a two-movie epic. But it was forced to be one two hour movie (THAT sounds familiar doesn't it?). Simon helped write First Class, DOFP, had a much better script for Last Stand before the studio shoehorned in the Cure arc with other writers, etc. Simon had about as much to do with Fant4stic as Nolan had to do with JL. His name's technically there, but he had no real impact.",2
"‚ÄúReally good‚Äù give me a break.  They were 25-35 year olds playing high schools. It was so cheesy, heavy handed and nonsensical it hurt",1
He stated his opinion and people responded. That's what you get when you post on social media.,2
I don‚Äôt agree with that but I didn‚Äôt feel the need to plaster my opinions here.,0
I have no idea how you could see any good in that movie. It‚Äôs horrible.,0
His letterboxd review of fant4stic.,2
On letterboxd. His review of Fan4stic.,2
"Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen",2
I share the sentiments. Everyone here thinks Snyder is way better than he actually is.   He coined a stellar shooting style and then outside of 300 it just feels wrong.   300 excelled because it's minimal story with a lot of action. So when he moved on to other movies that were more intuitive he falls behind.,1
Agreed. There were some good ideas in there. I for one really liked that Reed had constructed a suit to help keep himself together and that he could mimic other people‚Äôs faces.   Man. I do hope we get a really good Fantastic Four movie or series at some point. The characters are so great and Dr. Doom is one of the best villains imo. I always thought after Thanos Dr. Doom should be the next big threat.,3
"I don‚Äôt know, from the rumors and leaks it seemed fairly faithful to the Ultimate Fantastic Four, it‚Äôs just that the main Fantastic Four story is so iconic that making an ultimate FF story before a decent regular FF movie was made was probably a bad idea.   I‚Äôm interested to see Trank‚Äôs Al Capone movie with Tom Hardy coming out soon to see if he just had a thought break or he was just lucky with Chronicle",2
"I would like to see the TrankCut, but I'd doubt Disney would ever release a director's cut of a superhero movie, especially now, considering that the F4 is coming to the MCU.",3
It was said that kinberg came in and shot the entire third act,2
"If not Kinberg... and that was just a guess, as I said... who do you think might have been brought in to reshoot the third act of Fant4stic Four? Because it sure doesn't look like Trank .",1
"I guess you didn't like it, heh! I enjoyed seeing the younger versions. I never read the comic book run that did that it's them being young adults (""Ultimate "" something or other). But I liked the Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B Jordan, Jamie Bell versions. It was something fresh. For me, that is. I liked it.",1
dr doom has great scene on that lab unlike mcu movie. its also looks scarier too than any mcu scenes,1
Kinda annoying how no one is posting the link:  [https://letterboxd.com/joshuatrank/film/fantastic-four/](https://letterboxd.com/joshuatrank/film/fantastic-four/)   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,0
"300??? Really??? 300 is a legendary and iconic movie? üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Watchmen was almost frame by frame out of the comic book, even then he threw some supernatural fighting in there which wasn't comic book accurate. So Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore are the ones to thank for Watchmen.",0
"Exactly! He went from ""This. Is. Spartaaaaa!"" To ""Marthaaaaaaaa!""  All I see on this sub is Snyder this and Snyder that, if he was so good then why did his movies not do so well? Not just by the mainstream standards but actually by people who love comic books. I honestly don't know many people who are true comic book fans that enjoyed BvS.   When it first came out and people bashed it, I defended it (because it was DC and Batman is my favorite character) but looking back on it, it was a pile of hot garbage.   They keep saying ""he did such a great job with Watchmen"" but let's face it most of it was taken straight out of the book. Line for line out of the book, things that weren't from the book didn't fit in. He made Night Owl and Jupiter some crazy athletic, super strength having heroes, when they weren't.",1
FF will probably be the first Fox property that Marvel Studios makes. I can‚Äôt wait.,1
the only good trank could direct is akira movie. thats basically his tone and style all over the story. make it trilogy movie with 100m budget and force him to direct back to back for 3 movie then release it one in every year,1
"Given its quality, can I say Brett Ratner? Cause I swear to God, it's very Brett Ratner.",1
Doom is garbage in that movie! Why tf does he inexplicably have head exploding powers.,1
"300 was objectively an iconic movie.  Now legendary, yeah I agree the only legendary thing about it was the production label.",2
"I can't call it iconic, if tomorrow that movie doesn't exist it wouldn't change anything in the industry. It wasn't some crazy inspiration that led the industry in the new direction, it honestly was just a CGI filled ""meh"" movie.  I went to the movie theater to watch it and that was one and only time that I watched that movie.   But that's just my personal opinion of course.  I don't like Snyder for multiple reasons but this sub looooooovvvesss him tho so I'm sure I'm in the minority.",0
"nobody hate you because you stated your opinion, people hate you because you coming to this subs and telling the whole reader what your emotion toward snyder.",0
I'm not emotional towards Snyder lol he is a terrible director lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ   Also did I say somebody hates me?,1
"I'd love for a Man of Steel sequel to be titled ""Man of Tommorow"". Would keep with the ""Man of"" theme, and would be a callback to the comic series that had the same name.  Edit: Also I wanna see Braniac as the main villan in a Superman movie really badly",3
Henry Cavill himself liked Bosslogic's post on instagram,3
"Cool poster. ""IF"" (and that's a big IF) we ever do get a Man of Steel sequel, I hope that it's not alien-based, much as I love Brainiac.  I think that after the triple-front threat from MOS, BvS and JL of alien-centric villains, Superman needs to face an Earthly threat that tests his humanity.   Manchester Black is still my number one pick.",2
"Personally I think Man of Steel should be subtitled as Birthright, like Man of Steel: Birthright or Superman: Brithright.   This shouldn‚Äôt be confused with comic of the same name, but I think the name ‚ÄúBirthright‚Äù really plays up the importance of Argo City, Kandor, Brainiac, Supergirl and Superman‚Äôs true mission and legacy. Which is about building a better world, rebuilding Krypton and creating new technology.",1
I thought this was Dr. Strange and Dormammu at first.,0
Brilliant work. I‚Äôd love it to be titled Man of Tomorrow too. Loosely adapt that comic of the same name maybe? But with Brainiac as the villain instead of Zod.  Great potential there.,1
"Same  Feel the convention would be fun as Man of Steel, Man of Tomorrow and Last Son of Krypton",1
Man of tomorrow just sounds a bit 1930 cringe imo. Superman: Last Son or last son of Krypton or Superman: Cerebral are all good,1
"I think they need to keep Henry Cavill, but distance themselves from Snyder's take and just name the movie ""SUPERMAN"" with no taglines.",1
"IIRC, Richard Pryor's character in Superman III was originally intended to be Brainiac. What happened to those plans, I don't know.",1
"Or ""Last Son of Krypton"". I think that would work perfectly.",1
"I legit made an account to say this. Man of Tomorrow would be the perfect title.   Mads Mikkelson for Brainiac.   If anyone can bring Cavill back, it's JJ and The Rock, plus Hiram and Dany Garcia are about to produce the Shazam/BA corner of the DC Films. Black Adam is definitely gonna be successful. Shazam was fairly loved and the sequel should perform even better.",1
I feel Black could work well (Alternatively there's Luthor and Parasite),1
">I think they need to keep Henry Cavill, but distance themselves from Snyder's take and just name the movie ""SUPERMAN"" with no taglines.   I think they need to keep Henry Cavill, but distance themselves from  JJ's take and just name the movie ""Man Of Steel 2"" with no taglines.",1
So you want it to bomb at the box office.,1
"I mean showing him The Dark Knight would be cool too, but not necessary to understand who Joker is.",2
"I don't think you really need any comic knowledge for this movie.   Hell, some would argue it's a better watch if you're **not** familiar with the comics",2
Just show him Joker directly.,1
"No. Hes fine. Other stuff will confuse him cause  It is irrelevant.  If you watch this film with that baggage, you're watching it wrong.",1
"If you show all that has come before (excluding SS, not all the fault lies with Leto though), more power to you, but he may get fatigued if you plan on doing this in a short duration of time. Though TDK is recommended.  Alternatively, just touch him upon Batman basics and let him know this Joker movie is about a man's descent into madness who while is not someone you need to root for, is someone whose circumstances you cannot help pity.   1) Joker is Batman's nemesis.  2) He is fairly unpredictable.  3) He does not have any fixed origin and has had varied interpretations across all media.  4) Thomas and Martha Wayne are Bruce Wayne's parents.  BTW, I'm Indian too.",1
Showing him any superhero movie (and him loving them) would be cool. But you really think its not important for him to know who joker is before watching the movie?,1
"Alright! Then ill just tell him who joker is, what he represents, and show him the movie! Thanks man",1
Yeah that sounds like a plan! I'll tell him who joker is supposed to be and just show him the movie,1
The movie does a great job of standing on its own.,1
"No it‚Äôs important for sure, but I think you could just show him some photos online and explain it.  It‚Äôs whatever, you do you :).",1
üëçüèº  Love your username. Is it supposed to spell out Zeppelin?,1
Thanks man! And yeah its supposed to spell zeppelin!,1
Also surpassing Captain Marvel's $700 million overseas gross as well.,3
Should pass 700M OS real quick.,3
Is it crazy that I think this movie can probably beat aladdin and toy story 4 once its run is over.,3
Can this movie still catch aquaman?,1
Aladdin is a sure bet. TS4 not yet.,2
no chance,2
"joker: 1.024b aquaman: 1.148b  124m difference, can be done",0
Lol it‚Äôs impossible.The movie is nearing the end of its  run,3
Nope. Joker is winding down its box office run. Check its daily numbers and weekend grosses. No chance it reaches Aquaman. It will surpass Aquaman domestic though,2
why did I get downvoted for this?,1
overseas,0
what if it gets an overseas release,0
its already opened in all markets apart from China where it won't open. Also its losing screens to newer movies like Frozen so its numbers will keep going down,2
It  might have lil boost with a Oscar season re release but that would be like a  $10M$-15M boost. Aquaman will remain king...for now.,0
Perfect minus the undies,2
Get rid of the trunks and it's perfect,3
What about the blue?,1
"Not only the trunks, but the white eyes too, along with making the ears shorter and not making the gloves and boots cloth material. And make the suit the same material design as BvS Batsuit.",0
The suit is blue and grey,1
Uh... Didn't realize. Thought it was black actually. That's quite a dark blue,1
[here ya go](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/e0pfjr/fanmade_long_halloween_inspired_batsuit_by/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf),1
That‚Äôs fair - I‚Äôll be posting the whole suit without any of the background pieces or filters later to show the colors,1
"Really good video, makes me appreciate Phoenix's makeup even more",2
Now I want fully deepfake TDK with Joaquin Phoenix and Joker with Heath Ledger.,2
It's hard to tell the difference.,2
I also really like the BvS version with the Kryptonian Joseph Campbell quote running though it,3
"I loved how retro, but modern the DCEU ""S"" shield turned out to be. It's a nice callback to the 50's Superman while updating it to look cleaner and more ""alien"".   It's sleek and aesthetically pleasing - probably my favorite live action ""S"" shield to date.",3
"It's not an 'S'... on my world, it means #ReleaseTheSnyderCut.",3
i love the big S... didn‚Äôt really like the one from Superman Returns,3
Best Superman suit,3
"If there is one thing the DCEU got perfectly Right, its the costumes",3
"the S is pretty cool, probably the one thing about the 2013-2017 suits that I actually consistently liked.   Oh the boots were killer too",3
I love the BVS/JL version.,3
"I thought the design and colouring was good, but where it won me over was the detail to the material, giving it a sort of [chain link](https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Man-of-Steel.jpg) vibe which really brought it together.",3
It's not an 'S',2
"God bless you, dood.          The best on-screen Superman, ever     and they're literally dwindling it.",3
"I‚Äôm lukewarm on Zack‚Äôs movies. I like a lot but not everything. My apologies.       BUTTTTTT      ALL the costumes in his movies were the best I‚Äôve ever seen in any superhero franchise. From Supes, Bats (my all time fave) to WW‚Äôs, down to Bruce‚Äôs tweed suits [drools]",2
They did a fantastic job.,2
That is the best 'S' design in all of Superman media IMO,1
Still upset we don't have a guaranteed Cavill,1
"I recently tried redesigning the S shield and wow. I had no clue how hard it was to do that. It gave me a whole new respect for these guys. Its like trying to redesign the American flag, you can try, but itll never hold up the iconic design and at best it will seem a bit derivative of past designs. Plus theres a good chance that it wont be accepted by the fans and you have no clue how people will react until its out there, which is very daunting in its own right. They nailed it here, perfect blend of an alien style with the classic sensibilities. I have tons of respect for them.",1
"I love the big ""S"" shield on the suit.  Really bold, genuine hope.  All Snyder wanted to do was take Superman seriously, as he should be, considering he is one of the most popular figures in modern fiction.  He's beyond comic books, he is a mythological figure of American culture.  What's so funny about helping people for the sake of it?    Sadly, Geoff ""so-called comics expert"" Johns and his goons ruined this evolved Superman and turned him into a total clown.  Self-indulgent, self conscious, like his ""beliefs"" just appeared in a vacuum.  Completely misunderstanding the myth of Superman.    You think this is funny Joss?  You think this is a joke?    You're living in a fucking dream world.",3
"While I don't like how the DCEU superman suits have looked so far, the S logo is pretty damn good.",1
they changed this perfect suit so much :((,1
I think they made it more believable that it was a symbol or Crest from Krypton.,1
Meanwhile Tim Burton's take on redesign was a terrible one. Glad the movie got cancelled.  https://superman.fandom.com/wiki/Superman_Lives?file=Burton_S.jpg,1

I recognized it as Fleischer inspired but I cant say I loved it right away. I guess I got used to it.,1
And yet some morons don‚Äôt appreciate it.,0
"I was gonna say, the latest version of his suit is probably the most creative way of making a movie Superman suit. I almost can‚Äôt believe no one ever thought of making it look like an actual alien suit. It‚Äôs fucking awesome.",3
"Yeah, I actually didn't like the texture in MoS that much, but I loved the upgrade.",3
Yea same here. It looks so much better that way.,2
"I think ditching the red trunks helped too, even though that probably would‚Äôve been a nice touch too",3
"Agreed. The ""S"" on the Kryptonian suits in the prologue looked especially sick",3
I heard there are multiple smaller ‚ÄúS‚Äùs put all around the suit. Such creativity!,3
"The alien backstory stuff was really deep and impressive.  It's truly the only way to do Supes these days, is to put him next to the alien status.  Build a dome stuff.  Build that wall.  Superman is OP, but is super HUMAN as well bc of the customs he lived in here, but some extreme examples treat him like shit bc he is not human, and therefore a threat according to him.   Lex.  Talkin to you Prez/",3
I hate the lack of red trunks and the basketball texture of everything plus the muted colors but the S is literally the best version they've EVER put out before.,2
This needs more upvote here and another separate post outside. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
"It‚Äôs not an S, it means Hope!",1
Didn't like how they made it smaller for bvs either.,3
"Completely agree. Superman and Shazam's costumes are my favorite costumes from any comic book movie. Also, happy cake day!",3
Wonder Woman‚Äôs outfits are amazing as well,3
Michael Wilkinson. I couldn‚Äôt tell you the name of any other costume designer. I think that says a lot about what he created.,2
*cries in Flash suit* lmao that thing was trash,3
"I can agree with this, the costumes and sets are absolutely amazing.  But the dc method just isn't my style, I'm not going to say anything negative but they're polar opposite of the way marvel handles their movies and i enjoy the marvel ones.",2

"I don't know if you're being sarcastic, but, Geoff Johns needs to go back and stay in the comics department.. and be locked in there... Foreveerrrrrrrr.",3
"That design was inspired by the Red and Blue Supermen versions, which were recent at the time the movie was being developed. That isn't really an excuse, but I'm just pointing out that it did have some basis in the comics.",1
"I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted for this. I personally disagree, but you have a valid opinion.",2
I hate they brought the trunks back in Rebirth,3
I wish they kept it. Henry Cavill can prolly wear anything and make it look good.,3

"Aquaman's I loved too. It was faithful to the origin comics orange and green, but modernised enough to look badass and like actually royal armour. With the 'A' on the belt for King Atlan instead of Aquaman too, really knocked it out of the park",3
no it made sense thematically,3
it looked... very hard to run in.,2
Hmmm... Flash is my favorite hero (Katana/Zatanna imagery nonwithstanding) and I kinda get why the suit. Have you searched for  Flash statues or cosplay until about 2010? There wasn't all that much to work with before.,1
I think he was quoting Supes from MoS.,2
"I second this because he still working on the movies, it just listed as his studio rather them him by himself. His worked on Shazam, Aquaman, Wonder Women 1984.",2
"It all started during MoS, when he was jealous that he couldn't get his grubby paws all over Snyder's movie.  Of course he moved up the ranks of DC Entertainment as the movies continued, until after BvS he shot up the ladder because he was seen as the ""comics expert.""  There was growing opinion amongst critics, journalists, and bloggers that the Snyder DC movies weren't accurate to who DC heroes were in the source material, and plugging in Johns was somehow the answer to this so-called ""dilemma.""    What they, including Geoff Johns don't understand is that Snyder was portraying the heroes exactly as they were originally designed.  Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are not close to the same light as characters like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, or the Hulk.  DC's heroes are closer to religion than Marvel's, mythological figures who are whatever we need them to be in the modern world.  They should tell the collective story of humanity.  It's clear to see this when looking at Zack's planned arc: birth, loss of innocence, death, resurrection, uniting the land, punishment, restoration.    More so than his blatant misunderstanding of DC's superheroes is his attitude towards film making.  Refusing to acknowledge Snyder's contributions, tag him with other DC directors, or let him make his movies from a singular vision just speaks to his arrogance.  I still can't believe WB handed the ""car keys of hope"" to a yuppie who still worships Richard Donner after all these years, taking cheap shots at Snyder while hiding like a coward behind his ball cap.    Good riddance to the snake in the grass.  Hopefully now we get to see the Snyder Cut, and even then it's changed from Zack's original plans.",0
"Not being sarcastic.  Good riddance to the snake in the grass.    Does anybody actually believe a yuppie man child who worships Richard Donner after all these years is the right man to portray DC's mythological figures?    Even then, he's an entitled rich kid with no professionalism.  Taking cheap shots at Snyder while cowering behind his stupid ball cap, then feigning sympathy for Zack's daughter's suicide.  Yet he orchestrated the whole thing!  Shame on him.",0
Hate them even more on bats,3
Honestly I blame Bendis,2
Damn you Didio.,2
Give him the credit he deserves. He can also wear nothing and make it look great.,3
"I like it too, but I remember at the time people thought it looks silly and too ""homemade""",2
"Bro I got so excited when I saw the shot of Arthur in the classic costume in the trailer. They absolutely nailed it. Kinda wish they had Jason dye his hair blonde, but it‚Äôs aight.",3
Expand  Edit: actually name a single theme JL even had lol,2
"Ironically the MCU barely reflects the comics. Thor, Spider-Man and Hulk (Especially Hulk, dear lord) stand out as characters aren‚Äôt like their comic iterations beyond the superficial. This isn‚Äôt always bad (Except Hulk. My word Bruce what happened?). But it‚Äôs not a valid criticism is my point.",2
"Although I was fucking about with that lock him up in a writing room b.s...  I for one, heavily believe he stirred the pot, and himself and Kevin Tsujihara only had their own self interests there. Johns is jealous of Fiege, and the fact they got Joss over to finish was an obvious attempt at where GJ's stance is.   Joss's comments are not better.",0
There will probably be a lot of that in Witcher lmao,3
"""My mother made it for me.""",3
Damn nobody‚Äôs talking about how they nailed Batman...,3
"It was a prototype Flash made to sustain friction damage, it is made of trashed space rocket parts linked together by metal wiring. Bruce Wayne was supposed to give him a new suit after the Steppenwolf fight, not sure if it happens at the end of the snyder cut or JL2, but you can see the older version of that suit as the knightmare flash suit, someone took a picture of it while in the set of either BvS or Justice League.",2
One can only hope,3
That too. Batfleck gave me chills. His costume was the most comic accurate yet also scary and aesthetic in any Batman movie. Hopefully Battinson's costume is like that too.,3
Batfleck's suit perfectly nailed Miller's Batman. From the normal suit to that absolutely beautiful mech suit that was ripped straight off the pages of TDKR,1
I hope battinson's outfit is the long halloween/hush one but with the trunks replaced with an empty non-armored area with a bluish bodysuit.  He DID have a conversation with Christian Bale about the most important part being able to comfortably go to the bathroom.,2
Cyborg flirting with Diana in back,1
Batman : üëÄ,2
Batman is with Superman.,1
Fuck yeah! That‚Äôs inspired casting,3
"Man, I hope he has the scars! Nice work.",2
I get the feeling he's about to show me to my table and give me the wine list.  ..that or a gangster.,2
Agent Simmons as Falcone?!  Count me in!,2
"Wow nice, that looks ripped straight out of the Long Halloween!",2
Very very sneaky,1
"Tell Batman, let's tango.",1
"I just want them to go with Darwyn Cooke's design for Catwoman, for me it's the definitive Catwoman and it astounds me we've not seen that version adapted yet",3
"The Arkham games nailed her look, and proved it could look good in a realistic way. I‚Äôd go with that",2
"I think the complete opposite. The batman suit is way more complex just look at all the different live action iterations. The catwoman suit is just a black skin tight suit, you really can't mess this up.",2
I would like the Cooke design or the Joelle Jones one!,1
i want the 90s purple suit personally.,1
That was pretty much Anne Hathaway‚Äôs Catwoman minus the cow even then the eyepiece was pretty similar.,1
also cleavage,1
"And yet, Halle Berry‚Äôs costume.",3
"They‚Äôre similar in the fact that they both wear a black body suit, which like every Catwoman does. The masks are completely different",1
truer words have never been spoken,1
The breast üòçüòçüî•üî•,1
Robert DeNiro?!,1
Thanks dude!,1
It most likely got turned into the recent HBO series,3
That would be so pointless... but to be fair they did a third WW origin movie recently too.,2
"the only reports I can find on it is from CBR, are they trusted or not?",1
"Uh, it is the Watchmen series airing now on HBO.",0
There's already Watchmen: The Motion Comic free on youtube.   Watch it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLdqKIj3-A0&list=PL4uOTybEMFoaKrBXDrMvPXv5TkgA4-73p](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLdqKIj3-A0&list=PL4uOTybEMFoaKrBXDrMvPXv5TkgA4-73p),0
"I dunno about that - the series has been in development since around 2017, at least I recall hearing about a live action HBO series around that time.",2
"No, this would be different. HBO had been trying to do Watchmen for far before 2017 according to the Watchmen HBO official podcast.",2
"I can see value in having it be altered to be more in line with the TV series' continuity - marginal value, but value nonetheless. They'd need to do something meaningfully different with the animation or you may as well watch the motion comic (it has comedy value in the fact that there's only one V/O artist in it too).   If they did go ahead I'd like to see who they go for for Rorschach and their take on the character. I like JEH but Rorschach bein gravelly and expressive vocally isn't how I read him, they say he's monotonous - after the Blair Roche incident I imagined him being monotonous but a bit scattered, how do you sound frantically monotonous? I dunno how the fuck an actor ventures to communicate that but that's why they don't pay me the big bucks haha!",1
"Yes, in general they are. There were also several other sources that I found.",1
"I think they're discussing [this](https://www.cbr.com/watchmen-r-rated-animated-movie/) - I wonder if WB are retooling it slightly to be closer to the HBO series (voice cast, slight continuity alterations) so as to act as a prequel. The comic exists already so a flat out adaptation doesn't necessarily scratch any itch that isn't already satisfied by that.",2
"from what I've gathered, it was reported on the 13th and 14th of April 2017, never reported on since, and it was based on a user survey, it was a brief description of it and was basically a how much would you like to see this, I don't think it was actually planned at all",1
Aah ok.,1
You get Brucebumps.,3
I rewatched it yesterday. Ultimate edition gives so much to the story.,3
The continuity between MoS and BvS... seeing this event from the perspective of two different people... and the consequences of its second/third order effects... mind blowing.,3
Every time I watch this movie I get goosebumps. This movie may be very divisive but it's still one of my top 5 favourite comic book movies,3
The best Batman,3
"I was just rewatching BvS ue today and, yeah, whatever else may not have been perfect in that movie, this scene solidified Ben as Bruce to me. This, to me, is to Bruce Wayne as the first flight scene is to Clark in man of steel.",2
"This was the perfect Comicbook movie opening, and I love the part when he saves the little girl and how angry he looks.",3
"This is the DC that I want to see continued, and I'm sure a lot more people would agree if they gave the director's cut a chance.",3
Chills from this scene. How amazing the Snyder Cut of JL would be when they release it soon.,1
I love the music and the incredible sense of powerlessness you get.  It's absolutely one of my top 3 movie intros ever.,2
"I watched this two days ago with my girlfriend and my friend and me and my friend were freaking out about how much we love this scene, I don‚Äôt know if my girlfriend got it.",1
There is absolutely no way in hell that you can watch the beginning of the movie through this scene and not think you‚Äôre in for a masterpiece.   One of the best openings to a comic book film ever.,2
I can‚Äôt believe I just realized that he was driving a black vehicle. Like the batmobile...but it‚Äôs a Jeep,2
great opening,1
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever started a movie bawling my eyes out. This would‚Äôve definitely done it for me.,1
I remember watching this when i saw Bvs in the theater and was like i been on that street in Detroit Michigan and its near my favorite Comic book store Vault of Midnight,1
"As much as I dislike the Snyder DCEU, I can't deny that this is one of the best scenes in film history.",1
What is Bruce's purpose in that scene?,0
..boooo :p,2
"Yea. I sorta wished there was a mos 2 and a Batfleck Batman movie just before BvS, just so it can setup a more emotional impact",3
"i just bought it and watched it in full for the first time 2 days ago; i honestly liked the theatrical cut, but the ultimate edition was just so much better",1
"Snyder has said that people had started to accept that superhero movies have to have post credit scenes so he wanted to do something different. He had the idea of starting each film with a clip of the ending of the previous film from a different point of view. JL was supposed to start with the death of Superman from Lois Lane‚Äôs point of view. She watches him pick up the spear and fly away, hears a scream and sees Doomsday die and then she goes running over.",3
"to be fair, even at 9/11 people didnt immediately evacuate the building",1
"To pin an action scene on I guess.   You're right that there isn't a specific character motivation (hell, if he were dressed as Batman, I could at least understand, he wants to ... somehow try to fight). The intensity at which he's driving toward .. something would make you think he's .. going to help evacuate his building I guess? It's strange. I guess they must've felt that they couldn't just have Bruce sitting at Wayne Manor in Gotham watching on the news, as they'd think he'd want to do something, but, they also don't really have a good sense of what he'd actually be doing.   A good idea for an opening and I like it for the most part, but, yeah, just a bit strange. Also, it's sort of unintentionally funny that his employees refuse to stop working until their CEO calls them specifically. *There's a giant alien space laser ffs, no one thinks to run for their lives?!*",1
"Agreed, a Batman movie before BvS could explain Bruce breaking his no killing rule - maybe a Death in the Family adaptation? That would even make Leto's Joker a better character (at least give him some depth)",2
"If this is true, I would‚Äôve cried like a baby starting off JL. I am not ashamed to admit that. LOL",2
That would of been amazing to see in Justice League. Rather than F ed up Cgi Henry Cavill's face.,1
"Oh God, then does that mean Justice League 2 would have theoretically started with the League facing Darkseid in the Boom Tube portal since that's how Justice League was supposed to end? Damn just thinking about it makes me nut.",1
"> something would make you think he's .. going to help evacuate his building I guess?  well yeah that is what he's doing. The he sees it get decimated. He helps his employee and saves a little girl.   He is unable to help more and feels totally powerless, and this drives the entire rest of the movie.   So not really just to pin an action scene, but pretty much the thematic driving force of the whole thing.",3
"I like how the manager waits to get the call from Bruce before evacuating.    ""People I know aliens are leveling the city but today is a normal work day""",1
"I'd say it's like Keaton. There never was a no kill rule. If Bruce is okay dealing horrible Brain damage and paralyzing people, why is the arguably more merciful option of killing off the table?",2
Oooo that would be awesomeeee. At least we're (hopefully) getting a long Halloween adaptation with Pattman.,2
He posted some pre-viz shots on Vero and talked about it,2
"Also, if you watch closely, when Doomsday dies in BvS, you see an energy shockwave radiating out from him like radio waves. When JL started it would have shown that the energy shockwave is what awoke the motherboxes.",1
There are a few rumors from people who said they were involved with JL that the early plans were to start JL 2 from the point of view of Desaad and seeing Steppenwolfs head come in through the boomtube and seeing the JL standing on the other side.,2
"Dude, the standard Protocol is usually to not risk what could be a safe position. At that point the buildings aren't being harmed while people on the streets are getting killed by the world engine debris. It's only when Zod's ship starts crashing through buildings and Supes and Zod are fighting that buildings start falling.",2
Don‚Äôt forget that on 9/11 everyone was told to stay inside until the second plane hit. Staying inside during an emergency is SOP you don‚Äôt want people flooding the streets and getting injured or blocking EMS vehicles.,2
"This comes up everytime but this is exactly what happened during 9/11, which the entire Black Zero event painstakingly emulates.",2
"Oh, I'm not saying I'm against Snyder's depiction for Batman because he kills, it's just an observation - maybe showing Jason's death would give some context.",2
"I just created a Vero account for the sole reason of following Zack. I am not disappointed. I haven‚Äôt seen his posts on the shots yet, but his posts on other stuff are great!",1
Stop. I can only get so hard.,2
"Seriously I‚Äôm always shocked at how people overlook this or don‚Äôt get it. Or when people say that Bruce‚Äôs reaction was over the top. Do people forget how many people‚Äôs brains broke because of 9/11? We‚Äôre still dealing with the fallout today, almost 20 years later.",2
https://imgur.com/a/UvlrPvd  That‚Äôs the pre-viz shot of Doomsday holding Superman after they both died. You can see the hole in Supe‚Äôs chest.   BvS started with the text ‚ÄúThe world is introduced to The Superman‚Äù. JL would have started with the text ‚ÄúHe has yet to rise‚Äù followed by Supe‚Äôs death from Lois Lane‚Äôs POV.,2
This man is not our enemy,2
Now that‚Äôs how u make a superhero suit üòç,2
#MAJESTIC,2
Beautiful. That's the Superman I love.,1
You got the photo that was posted here a couple of days and made it worse by darkening it lol,0
I clearly mentioned Snyder Cut üòÅ  Just Kidding. I made it darker only because of my phone display.:),1
It looks better tho. His padding works under low light pretty well and you mate it more cinematic. That's how creativity and cinema works. Don't care about people who wants everything brighter than normal.,1
Damn Falcone hasn't even been rumored. This cast is gonna be giant by the time it's done casting.,3
"tell Megatron, let‚Äôs tango",3
This casting was very very sneaky sir,3
I am directly below the enemy scrotum.,3
You don't fuck with the Jesus,3
Can you hear this sound on the distance?  It‚Äôs the sound of The Long Halloween.,3
‚ÄúThe DC Universe is having a hard time attracting talent‚Äù  Grace Randolph,3
I remember seeing him in Transformers. Guy is funny as hell.,3
"Turturro is a wonderful character actor, so his interpretation of the Crime Boss might surprise us all. Reeves‚Äô picks for this Bat Cast has been nothing short of refreshing.",3
DUDES! hes definitely an underrated actor. Unexpectedly great choice imo.,3
*Turturro  Sorry!,3
You think you‚Äôre better than me cuz you got both your nuts?,3
Wow! Amazing cast so far! Let‚Äôs go!,3
"Fuck yeah! Go watch him in The Night Of, he was fantastic.",3
This is absolutely exciting because I think this casting is awesome and because it seemingly confirms that this will at least be loosely based on Long Halloween.,3
Literally just adapt Long Halloween exactly and I‚Äôll give you all my money,2
That is awesome!,2
That's an inspired choice,2
I fuck you in the ass Saturday batman...i fuck you in the ass next Wednesday instead,2
Oh cool! Love this guy!,2
Love this casting!,2
Oh my fuck this is amazing.,2
Now get John Goodman!,2
Has he even confirmed the Colin Farrell casting?,2
Top notch casting. Falcone will suit him.,1
"Batman: **WHERE IS HE ?**  Carmine: *Let me tell you something, pendejo. You pull any of your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you, and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger 'til it goes ""click.""*",2
"ngl haven't been on board with all the casting but this has actually brought my interest back, fucking love John Turturro!",1
I like when a casting comes out of the blue and was not on fancasts. Shows the casting director just doesn't go for the easy solutions.,1
Holy mother fucking SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT,2
Whoa. When can I buy my ticket?,1
"I mainly remember him from Transformers. Despite that franchise, I liked his character and the way he acts.",1
"The usual suspects are in Matt reeves's replies harassing him, with release the snydercut hashtags.  The very same people fighting for ""CREATIVE FREEDOM"" for Zack Snyder smh. Irony is dead.",1
They cast him quicker and sneakier than Liverpool signed Fabinho,1
"Ah yes, the phantom!",1
Don‚Äôt you see Everett?! Them Gotham City Sirens done warshed Don Falcone and turned him into a...  horneyed toad!,1
And now announce John Goodman as Harvey Bullock.,1
Does any see him as menacing mob boss type? I know he is a great character actor but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen him be a tough/menacing character. Only casting choice I‚Äôm slightly skeptical of so far.,1
Hmmm I'm a little mixed on that one,0
"I haven‚Äôt been following this film‚Äôs news super closely but it seems like there are a ton of villains. Like, almost too many villains.",0
It was a evidence considering he‚Äôs basing it on the long Halloween.,3
He was teased from Umberto Gonzales,3
ONE MAN  ALONE  BETRAYED BY THE COUNTRY HE LOVES,3
Holy shit that's him ? Perfect casting,2
[mfw](https://media1.tenor.com/images/b3e340eb9c2abe3186ba120386b62d53/tenor.gif?itemid=10739434),3
"Me and Liam man, we're gonna fuck you up!",3
"You ready to get fucked, man?",1
Eight year olds dude.,1
I‚Äôd bet some good money she‚Äôs just going to call everyone ‚Äòbox office poison‚Äô,3
"She is delusional, she thinks that talent = hollywood star, a batman movie doesnt need A list stars to sell, it needs talent, and this cast is full of very talented actors",3
She is just awful.,3
"For all things that DC's been perceived to be lacking in, talent has never been one of them.",3
Is she still a thing? Do people actually pay attention to or care what she says? I saw a couple of her videos on YouTube years ago and thought she was pretty meh.,2
The DCEU has generally had a very high standard of acting talent associated with it. Just hoping the script delivers on the promise. And Grace and go do one,1
To be fair Turturro was in Transformers so he is not exactly picky.,0
"Grenada, man.... Grenada",2
Agreed! He was GREAT in The Night Of. Love this casting!,2
He‚Äôs a highlight in every movie I‚Äôve ever seen him in. He‚Äôs got great screen presence.,1
Him and his fucking gross feet.,1
I dunno i'm torn. I'd like it to mimic the vibe but don't want a  beat for beat retelling. Then there's is no surprise?,3
Replace piece with the Batclaw in this sentence and it's perfect,1
That means Reeves gotta get Jon Voight too lol.,1
"""yOu HIjAcKEd BeNS moOViee""",1
Man you‚Äôre behind. The film starts filming in January. Of course it‚Äôs casting like crazy right now.,2
> I know he is a great character actor   You contradicted yourself son.,2
You legit just said ‚Äúcharacter actor‚Äù all skepticism should be thrown aside after that,2
"Well, The Long Halloween has a lot of villains in it.",3
We dont know much about it. Some could play small roles to the big bad.,2
Oh I must have missed that. Was it recent?,2
Rich bastards. I used to hate 'em! Now...  Him and Shia made the first 3 Transformers movies so much fun,3
I can't believe you just made me want to watch Transformers revenge of the fallen,3
This might be my favorite movie quotes of all time.,2
DUTCH!,1
"Yeah, well that‚Äôs just like... your opinion man.",3
I mean Robert De Niro was in meet the fockers. So I would say it doesn‚Äôt matter what movie he was in as long as he is a good actor.,3
Oh man. I didn't mind his character too...tbh 1st transformers was alright.  I think the studio and producers saw money in their eyes for the sequels and tried to get blood out of a stone with the quality put out.,1
I'm aware. I'm saying it felt like yesterday when the project was announced and now we're here.,1
Sigh.  When is everyone finally going to realize they‚Äôre not starting in January?  Think March.  At the earliest.,1
"No I didn‚Äôt. John C. Reilly is a great character actor, doesn‚Äôt mean he would make a good Falcone.",0
Just because someone is a great character actor doesn‚Äôt mean they can play every character great.,0
A month ago,2
That was from Dark Of The Moon aka the best Transformers sequel,1
8* year olds dude.  Edit. Thanks r/Elysium94,2
"I didn't say he wasn't a good actor.  I said he wasn't picky, which is what I think Grace was referring to; the DCEU can't attract picky actors although even then she's wrong",1
To me it's felt like years lol,2
It‚Äôs set to. Might or might not.,1
Disagree. Character actors are natural born chameleons you either have it or you don‚Äôt. Anybody can be a Great actor with practice and some talent. Character actors are few and far between. You know the last great character actor we had? Michael Shannon. I don‚Äôt need to explain anything else. Except Michael Shannon,1
"I thought that was ROTF, when him and that other kid split up from Sam.  Edit: Here it is in ROTF https://youtu.be/vUSIuxLYgN0",1
"\*8 year olds.     mr\_himselph, you're out of your element!",2
Yeah she‚Äôs weird.,1
Yeah I remember when we just kept hearing ‚Äúhe‚Äôs polishing the script‚Äù every other month for three or two years. Thank God we‚Äôre here now.,2
"No, it's really not set to.",0
There isn‚Äôt anything to disagree with. You don‚Äôt seem to understand what a character actor is. You can choose to think of a character actor in your own way if you like but words have definable meanings for a reason.,0
You don‚Äôt seem to understand what a character actor is lol. A Character actor isn‚Äôt an actor who plays a character. If that were that a case then every actor can be considered a character actor because they all play characters. A character actor is a supporting actor who can play eccentric and interesting or wild characters. It‚Äôs very hard to become a character actor because it takes immense amount of talent. John Turturro has spent his entire career playing wild and eccentric characters. He can easily slip into a role like Carmine Falcone and it doesn‚Äôt hurt that he‚Äôs also Italian. Your right there‚Äôs nothing to argue here because you already admitted why John Turturro can do this. There‚Äôs literally no reason to be skeptical,1
LOL.  Okay then.  Talk to you on January 31st.,1
He's for sure adapting the long Halloween spot on casting btw,3
"Give him the white hair, cheek scar, moustache and tell him to get a little bigger and he‚Äôs pretty spot on",3
"If he's drawing from The Long Halloween, I wonder if they will go with the implication that Selina is Falcone's daughter, since Loeb and Sale implied that in several of their minis together.",3
He feels more like Alberto but I see it,1
He really doesn't need to get bigger. Carmine doesn't really need to be physically imposing.,3
Bigger ? Falcone doesnt have to be big,3
His hair is peppered cause he's much older. Watch the Night Of. He's like Stanley Tucci level actor.,1
I prefer Selina be the Lions daughter. When in Rome implied a lot of confusing sentiments.,1
"Reeves wouldn't have to adhere to that if it's not needed. In the comics, Mera and Nereus were actually a couple instead of father and daughter like in 'Aquaman'.",1
Could definitely see young Turturro as Alberto but at 62 nowadays he should be a good Carmine.,2
He said a little bigger. Ain‚Äôt nothing wrong with gaining a little 10 pounds for the role.,2
He said a little bigger..,0
"And? I said I wonder if he'll be using it, not that they'll be strictly adhering to the canon. I'm aware that comic book movies take liberties.",3
"DC and marvel need to swap sides on the political level in that picture. Disney is very right wing, but also creates content that the left suck right up.",3
"I wasn't trying to line things up into camps with that depiction, though. I was trying to decry the tendency of people to do just that.",2
Disney? Right wing? JFL,0
"I get it, don't worry, you don't want to be doing that. I wasn't calling you out. More so pointing out the obvious for others, should anyone misinterpret that.",2
Disney? Left Wing? ROTFL,2
OK thank you.,1
Yes it is way left wing.,0
You guys are ironically demonstrating my point there. Maybe everything doesn't fit neatly on one side or another of these traditional tribal divides?,2
"Not everything for sure, but Disney does. Disney is way left wing.",0
Jay was in Zack‚Äôs corner since Day 1. He put John Campea in a body bag earlier this year.    https://twitter.com/jayoliva1/status/1137811781487738881?s=21,3
WB should have him adapt Zacks original 5 movie arc to animation.,3
Gatekeeping of a certain image of characters has become a problem with many fandoms but DC and Star Wars have been affected the most imo.,3
"Those set of comments is what alot of fans dont understand. They want heroes to stay the same.  As soon as they're placed in our bleak world,  everyone loses their mind.  It's another version/ take on the superhero. And you can still find the core themes/ideology they represent.   ""I'm like.. wake the f*ck up!""",3
I hope to someday be able to stunt on hoes as hard as JO,3
"> Zack‚Äôs version is far from a betrayal and if the audience had stuck with it, they would have seen an epic DC story that fans would have loved. If this were based on a comic or novel, people would have said just wait until the final payoff.  > What we got was basically ending the story after Harry Potter‚Äôs second book and decrying that it‚Äôs a terrible series. When you come up with any story, you work out the ending and then work backwards. Zack had a great way to end this series.  I believe him. You don't have to, but I do.",3
The very definition of getting STRAIGHT OWNED,3
Fucking tell it Jay!,3
Love Jay's comments about the iterative nature of the characters and how the character of Superman was influenced by current events. I also love how he talks about the different levels of experience each DCEU hero had. I think that would have led to a lot of cool conversations and interactions between different characters. One of my most anticipated parts of JL was seeing Batman and Wonder Woman mentor The FLash and Cyborg and imparting their experiences onto them.,3
I dont get it why some DC or whatever fans are against SC. Its not gonna change the current dynamic of DC universe neither its gonna ruin someone's life. If its good then we will have a good time with it otherwise they will get another opportunity to talk crap about Snyder.Its a win win situation for both.,2
"His comments also reflect why MOS is so damn great. It‚Äôs a Clark kent who grew up during 911 and Sandy Hook. He was Superman for ONE FUCKING Day.   ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt smile or say Truth, Justice, and the American way.‚Äù   Nah. MOS is a god damned masterpiece",3
I love Jay so much. He takes zero shits from anyone.,3
"Something else that Jay said recently that I did not know. Snyder said in his behind the scenes stuff that Batman shot a mutant in the head in The Dark Knight Returns and people claim he didn‚Äôt understand it and use that to show how he doesn‚Äôt understand the characters. However, Jay says he believes he shot the mutant in the head too, but he just didn‚Äôt want to pursue it in his film.",3
I like this guy :),3
"Damn, he *told* that guy. Haha, that was rad.",3
Why hasn't Jay been verified after all these years still beats me.,1
That dude that tried to go on Gal is a pleb,3
"As someone who is a lite fan of the DC universe (only read a handful of comics and shows and movies) it was MoS that got me to like Superman. I never was a fan of Superman even when I was young because he came off as perfect and untouchable. My dad likes that aspect of him because to him he cannot do no wrong.   Thanks to MoS it gave me a new look into supes and got me to give the character another try with the comics and found some that evoked the supes I prefer to see, everyone has their definitive version.   The comics I've read btw were Last Son of Krypton, Kingdom Come, Birthright, American Alien, I'm currently going through All-Star Superman and The Multiversity.   It's rather sad to see characters be gatekept  because they don't align with another's personal taste when you can learn so much from a different POV.",1
Fuckin good. I usually like Jody but he‚Äôs way too opinionated about this stuff.,1
>I‚Äôd you are a true fan you‚Äôd accept every version and not be some elitist thinking you are the gatekeeper of who these characters are or should be.  You people do realize that using this argument means that you can't criticize stuff like Batman & Robin right? After all if you're a TRUE fan then you have to accept ALL versions of the characters and not gatekeep. I guess this means people will stop ragging on Whedon's version of the characters in Justice League? After all TRUE fans accept EVERY version of the characters and aren't elitist gatekeepers.,1
"So, what exactly is gatekeeping?",1
"I don't care if they're faithful to the original depiction, I've never read a single comic book. I just want good storytelling.   Joker isn't faithful to any comic. But it's good storytelling.  The MCU takes extensive liberties with their use of comic book characters and storylines. But it's good storytelling.  Matt Reeves is making lots of cool, unconventional casting choices for The Batman, actors who you wouldn't expect based on the comic book depiction. Good for him, I very much look forward to seeing what he does.  Zack Snyder's depictions of DC characters stray from their traditional depictions. That in and of itself is not an issue. But his stories are poorly conceived, poorly written, and aggressively focus on visual style over substance. That's bad storytelling.  So no, I don't dislike Zack Snyder because I'm gatekeeping. I dislike him because he failed to tell a good story, or a story I found interesting. And sorry, Jay, judging by the results, the majority of the audience agreed. So maybe don't complain about the audience abandoning a story they didn't like. Snyder could have done a better job convincing the majority to stick with him. He chose to stick to his guns, which is admirable in a way, but also meant he failed to see his vision through. It's the creator's job to convince the paying audience to like their vision. He didn't, so don't blame everyone for giving up on it.   Wish Snyder all the best in his future endeavors, but I'm glad he's gone.",0
I hope the jokes = kiddie crowd is listening.,0
"That's not much of a ""body bag"" retort.",0
"Or at least just ayer's cut of SS, JL pt 1, and pt 2. Since bvs ue and mos are good to go.",3
"It was at its peak when Man of Steel came out. Fans came out of the woodwork saying ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my Superman! Bah humbug!‚Äù And I LOVED Man Of Steel.  I love Mark Waid as a writer but even I was embarrassed when he wrote that manifesto saying he was screaming ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it!‚Äù In the theater at the end of the final battle in MOS and how the movie ‚Äúgot Superman wrong.‚Äù  I would never begrudge a comic fan of their ideal version of Superman. My personal favorite iterations are John Byrnes‚Äô version, Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness, and Geoff Johns and Gary Frank‚Äôs. But if someone loves the All-Star Superman version, or even Brian Michael Bendis‚Äôs version, I‚Äôd never Tell‚Äôem ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the REAL Superman!‚Äù",3
"Indeed, and that gives you a clue in part why. They have something in common the MCU does not : more than one generation of cinematic legacy.",2
"It's not just about when superheroes are placed in a bleak world, but also when the movie acknowledges something *uncomfortable* about them.   TDKT is about as real as it gets in the world, but no one cared when Batman killed in those movies because the movies themselves *pretend* otherwise/refused to acknowlege it. Be it the entire league of shadows in BB, Dent, Talia, Talia's driver, or even Ra's himself.  The MCU is a master at this; they will selectively acknowledge important things but never pushes the audience to be uncomfortable with the flipside. Dr Strange had a throwaway line about how he will not kill again because he's a doctor, but that's never brought up again when he battles faceless goons. Black Panther pulls real world parallels for Kilmonger but ignores any for T'Challa (ie if Wakanda exists in real life, it would probably be the US's #1 threat the moment its borders are open. Also, his endeavor in Korea meant nothing).",3
Even more they need to understand that there are comics and adaptations of the character than just the mainstream depiction.,3
"Spot on.  They're still very much Superman and Batman.  It's just that BvS was a deconstruction of the audience's preconceived notions of both heroes.  The story is about what would make them unravel, and break their moral codes.  At the lowest level (literally, the lowest level of the building) however, they find that their POV overlap more than they thought.",1
I do too.   I think it's absolutely criminal that negative press ruined a set of superhero films that I was enjoying more than any other superhero saga I'd ever seen onscreen.  I pray that we get to see Zack's conclusion in some form.,3
"Yeah, I get so annoyed that people don't understand this.  He had never trained. This was not a Superman that had spent his life honing and training his powers - this was a Superman that had been constantly over-protected by his father who had feared him being taken away or weaponised.  And on his first ever time trying to do something bigger than just saving people in his immediate vicinity (like those oilrig workers or his classmates in the schoolbus), of **course** he doesn't know stuff like how to avoid collateral damage or how to fight people on his level. And he snapped Zod's neck, but this was someone who had explicitly told him in no uncertain terms that he would never stop coming for Kal-El and killing humans. And look at the pain he felt after having to take a life.  The only single potential criticism that I think has a fair basis is his smiling and kissing Lois in the aftermath of all that death, but even that is due to the fact that he's effectively human.  I'm pretty sure that after the amount of death and suffering and utter abject terror that I and everyone else had been through, I'd want to find comfort in the arms of someone who loves me deeply, who I'm happy is alive.  Besides, they address this all in BvS where he's clearly depressed, before he will eventually learn to find hope through the League and the realisation that (professionally) he's not alone.",3
I really enjoy cavills Superman because of that. We also saw him grow up and understand how helpless he was in that moment.   I think if we got a good backstory for batman that character could've worked too but without it people were never gonna accept it,2
> MOS is a god damned masterpiece  Seconded.,1
">However, Jay says he believes he shot the mutant in the head too, but he just didn‚Äôt want to pursue it in his film.   In the book batman says he hasn't been able to cross his line and break his rule when he's referring to the mutant leader, after the hostage situation with the mutant, so he didn't kill them. You also have the fact that the police don't mention it once, you think they'd let batman off with shooting a teen in the head?",1
Jay's a real one.,3
That's the kind of conviction that only comes with earned experience and values.,3
"Batman and Robin wasn‚Äôt hated on because it was a different interpretation. People just thought it was too corny, which happened after the studios were afraid that Batman film before it was too dark. (Sounds familiar doesn‚Äôt it?) Justice League was not Whedon‚Äôs interpretation, it was Whedon screwing with Zack‚Äôs interpretation according to what the studio wanted, resulting in a Frankenstein version of the movie. If Whedon had done his own standalone version that would be another thing.",1
"Tends to be used in the sense of : the act of controlling or limiting access to a community, identity, subculture or fandom via manipulative or obstructive appeal to ownership & authenticity.  >You're not a ""real"" Batman fan if you think Batman should ever ride a horse.  Or   >Real Star Wars fans do/don't like the OT/PT/ST/Holiday Special",3
shame you can't voice a reasonable opinion like this here without getting downvoted to oblivion.,1
I would be fine if they just made a Snyder Cut graphic novel.,3
Justice League 3 as well.,1
Did he actually scream that? That sounds really obnoxious to do unless he was the only one in the theater and even then I still find it weird that he was talking out loud,3
Waid is pathetic.,1
"Yep. When I first watched BvS I was thinking why Lex was behaving differently.  After Ultimate Edition, his plan became more clear and reading about BirthRight comic gave me more insight into what Jesse's Lex Luthor was.",3
"It's a damn shame.  The problem nowadays is that everyone needs to agree on these comic book films.  They must achieve a 95% on RT, they must make a billion dollars, they must be loved by the mainstream.  It's a business oriented, formulaic checklist approach.    Sorry, but that's not for me.  When I think of Batman and Superman I think of mythology, not popular celebrities.  I expect a story that's a product of our world.  I expect a cinematic tone.  I expect narratives that challenge our own issues in the modern world.    Zack was the only one with the balls to do it.",1
"Who knew that when Geoff Johns started the hope and optimism narrative it was the beginning of the end. Remember the interview where he said instead of 2 parts he wants to bring it together sooner? That was probably when the story line was fucked. Mind you, I'm not blaming Geoff here, I'm using the familiarity of this event as a timestamp of the story's inevitable demise. Back when people thought things had just kicked off, it was actually the beginning of the end. WB probably made a collective decision to shut it down, while spinning the narrative as coming together sooner.  Even though Terrio rewrote the original 2 part script with Zack to lighten up the story, coming together sooner was a WB mandate. IMO, neither of these guys knew what WB's real plan was. When they saw the loose ends and Easter Eggs of Zack's cut (where some might even see as fan service), they had to pay an enormous amount of money to remove them. Sneaky fucking bastards, lol. Hopefully Sarnoff keeps her transparency promise because we all know KT had secrets.",1
Batman isn't exactly a reliable narrator in TDKR. He has whole fugue states where he doesn't know what he's been doing  The cops wouldn't necessarily have evidence Batman did it. Both thugs were killed with each others' guns,2
"That‚Äôs only one way of interpreting it, which is Jay‚Äôs point. There‚Äôs the idea that Batman is in denial of the killing he has done, like how he may have killed Joker but is in denial of it. Jay said it was something he‚Äôs interested in, but he decided against it for the movie. He also thinks that it‚Äôs different with Batman when it comes to kids, he‚Äôs willing to toss his rules aside if it‚Äôs to save a child.",2
He shot the wall next to her head. There‚Äôs no way her head would look so in one piece after getting shot in such a close range with an M60.,1
In his own words. http://thrillbent.com/blog/man-of-steel-since-you-asked/,2
"I don't remember him having any after the one in the first issue, where he finds himself in the cave and shaved his mustache. I think that's meant to be ""Bruce"" and ""Batman"" warring in his mind and he becomes unified again when he puts the cape and cowl back on.",1
">Batman isn't exactly a reliable narrator in TDKR. He has whole fugue states where he doesn't know what he's been doing  As Bruce before he becomes batman again, it's used to show that he's lost and that batman is his true subconscious that wants to be free and take back the reins, to be his true self, but as Batman he's never shown to be unreliable outside of when he may or may not have killed Joker.  >The cops wouldn't necessarily have evidence Batman did it. Both thugs were killed with each others' guns.  The cops only need probable cause, which they definitely would have had. And even from the perspective to just demonise him, do you think they would have prioritised ""causing a public hazard"" over ""Suspected of murdering a teen""?",0
"The only time he's possibly in denial about killing someone in the book is with the Joker, he's not shown to be an unreliable narrator in the story apart from that scene, it would be really weird for that to have changed for that one scene, especially when again, the police are hounding him down for breaking and entering, assault etc but wouldn't bother charging him with murdering a kid? This batman is shown to be someone who *wants* to kill bad guys as the world would be better off without them but physically can't bring himself to do it, for that to change for just one scene feels weird and betrays some of the themes of the comic.  To interpret it that way means you have to assume Bruce isn't reliable, and I feel you need to make assumptions about that as the book doesn't really imply that, to me atleast, when he is being unreliable with the Joker, there is atleast some evidence like the grey balloons and him talking to the jokers dead body as if it were alive. With the mutant teen? There's nothing, it's not even mentioned again, if he didn't shoot them in the head, wouldn't miller have brought it up again?  I also luckily got to meet miller at a con and ask him about this, he said he didn't kill the mutant, he didn't even really care about where batman shot them. But obviously things change and miller may or may not have actually intended that when he had originally written and had drawn the story.   You can interpret the book in any way you want, I'm not saying Olivia or Snyder are inherently wrong on the issue as personal interpretation of any media is correct if it can be justified, and that scene ooc can definitely be read as batman killing them, but I feel that if batman did shoot the mutant in the head miller would have addressed it in the book, he's not a careless writer or artist (well, back then atleast), the story doesn't make sense to me unless this batman is so staunchly anti-killing, as it's such a big part of the book (The Dark Knight Returning to his principles) and it's what makes the climax with the Joker at the end of book 3 so great, as in that moment Bruce *might* have lost his principles and broke that promise, which makes him essentially want to kill the batman identity and become something else (before miller decided to continue with DK2 and DKIII obviously)",1
"Wow. I get that some people are longtime fans of different, more traditional takes on the Man of Steel, but he does realize it's just a movie right? He sounds dreadful to have your own opinions around",2
Yeah. But I still don't quite trust Bruce's interpretation of events.,1
">Batman he's never shown to be unreliable outside of when he may or may not have killed Joker.  The fact that he's unreliable at any point makes me question what he says about himself   >The cops only need probable cause, which they definitely would have had.  The cops would have hundreds of cases to sift through for charges. It'd be real easy to overlook/dismiss one case where it looks like two criminals shot each other with machine guns.   And Batman absolutely shot that Mutant. At that range, with that gun, that Mutant is dead.",1
"Yeah and either on Twitter or Facebook he tried saying Superman ‚Äúnever killed.‚Äù Then when people pointed out he did just that in Superman II, he said Zod, Non and Ursa were arrested in the international cut. Oh, you mean A DELETED SCENE THAT ISN‚ÄôT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THE FINAL CUT?",3
"The whole point of that ending was to put Superman in a no-win scenario.  The point was to actually test the character because that's the only way they grow and evolve.    The only way ANYTHING evolves is by deconstruction.  If we all just agreed with everything and said it was great we wouldn't even have any of these movies.  We'd be stuck with old 30's monster movies where you can see the string.    Zack's approach was right for Superman and Batman.  Challenge them, find out why they do what they do, what it would take to break their moral codes, what makes them tick, then redeem them.  You're understanding them from the inside-out by deconstruction.  Sometimes the execution, pacing, and efficiency was off in the movies, but I loved all of it.",1
">The fact that he's unreliable at any point makes me question what he says about himself   He's only possibly unreliable in that one instance as Batman if you believe he killed Joker, because he might have actually killed someone and his subconscious is trying to find a way out of it, but in that instance it is made quite clear that he's slightly fabricating events, as Jokers speech bubbles become like his own and he talks to the Jokers corpse as if it's laughing at him, miller is communicating that to readers. With the mutant there is literally nothing to suggest that batman did kill them and is convincing himself otherwise, if batman killing the mutant was Miller's intention, he would have made it clear. Instead miller has Batman 12 pages later explicitly say that he hasn't crossed the line he drew for himself, he hasn't killed anyone, Miller is making it clear he didn't kill anyone, including the mutant.   >The cops would have hundreds of cases to sift through for charges.   If someone was shot with a gun and killed at that case I'd find it very hard that they'd overlook it and levy ""causing a public hazard"" instead, especially with a new Commissioner who's making her opening address to specifically demonise Batman and that this case was a high priority case.  >It'd be real easy to overlook/dismiss one case where it looks like two criminals shot each other with machine guns.   You're forgetting this was a hostage situation with a child who's the heir to a business and fortune, something the media and the police are already *very* closely monitoring and something they likely knew batman had involved himself with as he rescued the child.   This wouldn't have been lost in mountains of paperwork, it was an ongoing investigation and a high priority case. If they had any reason to believe that batman killed the mutant, they would have plastered it across the TV, but all Yindel seems to think is important is assult, breaking and entering and creating a public hazard.  >And Batman absolutely shot that Mutant. At that range, with that gun, that Mutant is dead.  Batman is one of the most skilled marksman in the world, if he wanted to only maim them, he would have and evidently did. There's no entrywound on the body, nobody brings it up afterwards, the police commissioner who's first act as commissioner is to arrest batman didn't think it was important etc.   It looks like he might have killed them out of context sure, but the book makes it pretty clear he didn't kill them.",1
"Superman straight executes Zod in the comics. Zod is captured, restrained, all ready to get sent to the Phantom Zone or wherever. And Superman kills him with Kryptonite.",3
So....you're saying he shoots near them and the guy falls down?,1
"Yep, this guy shared the comic panel and the scene from superman II   https://twitter.com/DCEUNews/status/819013623091560448?s=20",1
"Probably yeah, obviously we can't know for sure, but when this batman is also incredibly anti-gun, it wouldn't surprise me if he just used it as a distraction method.   But if he did shoot them (which I feel would have been mentioned) he definitely did not kill them",1
That seems like a stretch to me,1
"But why? The panel isn't really clear enough to definitively say he did shoot them, let alone kill them, again, there's no entrywound but there is a hole in the wall (though I will say that could already have been there from the previous gun fire or any number of things). And with the fact that him shooting them isn't mentioned again by anyone, and him saying he didn't kill anyone, I think there is a valid case to be made that he didn't shoot them at all",1
"And that big splash on the wall isn't anything? Its a stretch to say he didn't shoot the Mutant. And a 7.62 round at that range? There's no safe place to shoot a person with that.   >him saying he didn't kill anyone,¬†  Batman isn't reliable. I don't trust his version of events.   I'd also like to point out that the new commissioner's list of charges is interrupted. It ends in a ""..."" because she had more to say.",1
">And that big splash on the wall isn't anything?  It could easily have been a pre-existing stain, there isn't an exit wound that lines up with the splash mark.  >Its a stretch to say he didn't shoot the Mutant. And a 7.62 round at that range? There's no safe place to shoot a person with that.   He could have just shot the wall next to them, there is a hole in the wall after all.   >Batman isn't reliable. I don't trust his version of events.  Batman isn't shown to be unreliable except for when he probably killed the Joker and miller made it clear that he was being unreliable in that moment, there isn't anything else to suggest he was being unreliable in that moment, especially then the commissioners comments weren't even told from Batman's point of view.  >I'd also like to point out that the new commissioner's list of charges is interrupted. It ends in a ""..."" because she had more to say.   If she thought batman killed the mutant she should have said it first as she was specifically targeting Batman in her opening adress, and if Miller wanted you to think he killed the mutant he would have made it clear by having Yindel go after him for murder.",1
Much better poster instead of mostly SHOWING HARLEY QUINN,3
womanspreading,3
Y'all got any more of them pixels,3
Honestly the fact that they put a Hyena in BoP is like a legit fanboy moment lol,3
Diana Ross & The Supremes   Beyonce and Them  I mean....I get it..... I get it,2
The outfits have grown on me tbh. I can see cosplayers having a lot of fun with Canary and Huntress.,3
Please tell me they're getting more comic-accurate costumes by the end of the movie.,3
new? I've seen it like 2 months ago,1
Wow so the Birds of Prey actually ARE in the Birds of Prey movie! This is the first time I've seen them!,1
I‚Äôm still not really liking the excessive amounts of yellow on Black Canary‚Äôs outfit but Huntresses looks a lot better here compared to in the other promo images. I think it‚Äôs the clear visible purple that makes it feel more comic accurate even though it‚Äôs not.,1
I miss secret identities,1
I support womanspreading.,2
That little guy is about to fu*k a lot of shit up! And I don't think people realize how much fun they're about to have at the movie theater with this film üòÇ,2

IMO Huntress isn't bad and maybe she'll end up with her mask by the end; Black Canary though yeah I'd like to see more comic accurate.,1
This poster is a bunch of shots of the cast photoshopped together.,1

I love when inspired casting choices just drop out of nowhere.  Wow.,3
"Fantastic actor, I think he‚Äôs going to be one of the greatest things in the movie.",3
Oof yes! Solid casting,2
"Hmmm at the end it says ""More to come"". Think we get more casting later today? Or am I just being optimistic?",3
I loved him in The Big Lebowski. Small role but a lasting impression,2

That is just pure beauty!,2
Pete from O Brother Where Art Thou? Nice! O Bother is one of my all time favorites!,2
This man killed it in The Night Of! So yes!   The casting of this movie has been so so good so far!,1
Very hyped to have an Italian in the role.,2
How is he in serious roles?,1
Win.,1
Have you all seen him in Miller's Crossing? He's in a gangster film.,1
"This is so good. I wasn't visualizing a Batman movie with Falcone in it, nor would I have ever come up with John Turturro for the role, but this is just incredible casting.   I'm a big fan of Reeves' ""cast a bunch of really good actors"" strategy so far.",1
This movie is gonna be fucking ripped,1
"Really excited for this but with Affleck announcing his new directed movie, I still think about his Batman movie.",0
Isn't he that comic guy from. Transformers movies??,1
"He was extremely annoying in the Transformers movies, but he's actually a great actor and could really pull this off.",0
odd,0
"God this movie is going to play out like one of the Transformer movies.  I'm guessing dozens of lines will be predictable, verbatim.      Bruce will be dark, solemn, and in search of ""something""     Riddler will have a plot, probably a ransom,  Penguin will have an even darker plot:  murder, chaos,  And then in the film's climax,  the previously immoral Catwoman will have a change of heart that will turn the tides for the caped crusader.

"Beyond the fact that Batman was planned far back, I can't blame them. They're just now emerging from a period of instability with several divisive movies that underperformed (and outright bombed in the case of Justice League), and Batman has traditionally been their most reliable money maker.

"This might just be the Batman fan in me talking, but I have to disagree. By the time The Batman comes out, it'll have been nearly a decade since we last got a pure solo Batman film. Sure we got little bits of him in the past few years (BVS, SS, I refuse to count JL), but that was when he had to share the screen with other characters.  I'm more than welcome towards another solo Batman movie, especially one that seems to be like it's going to be the kickoff to a new trilogy that will lead to a complete ""Bat-universe"" of characters if the rumors of what Matt has planned turn out to be true.",3
"To be fair a Birds of Prey movie is coming in Feb, soon followed by a Wonder Woman movie and then a Black Adam Movie.",1
"no, i want batman. he's literally the most important superhero dc has, and with the success of the nolan films and the positive reception towards batfleck in *batman v superman* i have no doubt a good, solid batman film would make an easy billion.",2
"I am actually very conflicted. On the one hand I want DC churning out more obscure characters, the Batfan in me cannot wait to see what Matt has in store for us. Also Giacchino making his DC debut. What's not to love?",1
"DC has to get audiences back on their side before they go too obscure. People still are wary over their films. But even then, Batman is only **one** movie of the **7 they have slated**, and by this time next year, that could be 10+ that aren't Batman/Superman.  Aquaman, WW, and Shazam are getting sequels. BoP is doing it's part with introducing new characters. SS is introducing more obscure characters and I believe Gunn will stick around with DC after filming GotG3; more obscurities and deep cuts would likely come with that. Black Adam is getting a movie that could spark more solos with JSA members being introduced. The Flash, New Gods, Batgirl, Plastic Man (Bill Hader pls!), Blue Beetle, etc are being worked.  I get what you mean, but patience is a virtue. DC Films were getting shat on just for existing like 2 years ago. Lol  They're taking it slow, focusing on distinction, and not necessarily worrying about over-connectivity. We as fans will have to be patient.",1
"I‚Äôm really looking forward to the batman film but, after recently discovering a wider range of DC characters through Injustice 2, I‚Äôve got to say that I think a Jaimie Reyes Blue Beetle film has the potential to be a surprise hit for many reasons",1
Gimmie question and dat Blue beetle :D,1
"Of course! But almost everyone who has a gripe with BvS says Batman should have gotten a movie first. Every time some new movie comes out, one hater will ask for a Batman movie. I'm glad this is being made.",2
"I think if depends on how Birds of Prey ( and you can argue that that movie is connected to Batmam too in a way because of Harley - Joker and the Gotham setting) Wonder Woman and Suicide Squad and Black Adam do.   With the success of the Joker  ( sure it made a lot of money because it was a great movie but I if it didn't have the name Joker the most popular villain of all time it wouldn't have made half of it even with the same cast and crew . That's the sad reality)  , Shazam underperforming and  the emphasis on Batman reboot I feel like DC might get the message that they should lean again on Batman and his mythology .  Aquaman and Wonder Woman did amazing but if  Black Adam, Suicide Squad with a ton of new characters ( even tho Harley is there) don't deliever then I feel like DC will start to lean only on those three. Time will tell  I wonder what if happen with Green Lanters Corps New Gods and Shazam 2. That would be an interesting way to see.how much audience is there for movies outside Aquaman, Batman and Wonder Woman and Superman for the future ( amd Flash but he is fairly established)",1
"This is why DC will continue to suck balls  They don‚Äôt have a plan and because of that they only had a couple good movies and lots of sub par ones   Love or hate them marvel studios had a plan and spent a decade building out a universe and keeping the same actors and introducing many minor characters along with the long time popular ones   In that time we‚Äôve gotten what out of DC?  Batman Begins, Dark Knight and Man of Steel were excellent, the rest not worth mentioning They‚Äôve at least had better animated movies and a few series, justice league dark and Constantine  were great  The only decent marvel series was the punisher",0
Umm   Green lantern Martian Manhunter And the Hawks??,0
"THis iS wHy Dc WiLl CoNtInUe To SuCK BallS. Keep yer yapping going, it‚Äôs entertaining. I like how you think having plan means a movie won‚Äôt suck",1
MM: If SC is released  GL: tv show Hawks: Black Adam movie,1
"Oh you poor thing show us on the SpiderMan doll where marvel hurt you   Comparing the last decade between marvel and DC , yes indeed having a plan has mattered   It‚Äôs ok if you want to be a fan boy though and think their hodgepodge approach has worked out",0
I mean in 1 ensemble movie lol. It shouldn‚Äôt take another 10 more years to see another JL movie.   Sucks to be a DC fan these days bro. It‚Äôs hard.,1
"You are hilarious. Having a plan won‚Äôt stop a movie from sucking, sometimes your plan just sucks. The DCEU is proof of that.",1
"I mean, you can tell no one put any emotion or care into the reshoots. You can‚Äôt blame them, though, as it does look like they poured their hearts out when filming the actual film. I feel bad for the cast having to film some sham just so studio heads could get their bonuses.",3
"And ""brief"" meaning just how much Cyborg is actually in the movie compared to the Snyder cut.",3
Lmao savage.,3
Oh my god I love him.,3
RAY FISHER FROM THE TOP ROPE,3
LOL I bet he was on set for like three days with Whedon given the quality but look how much of the film was changed. Insane.,3
"Maybe I‚Äôm dumb, but I‚Äôm not really understanding what he‚Äôs trying to say or how it‚Äôs a shot at WB/Whedon.",1
"I mean, just look at Affleck in the Josstice League.  Actually, don't watch it.  It's impossible to get through any of it without throwing up in your own mouth.  Rather, just trust me when I tell you that he looks like he's getting a root canal in his reshot ""Batman"" scenes.    It hurts more that the two biggest characters who got the worst of it were two of the greatest fictional heroes ever created.  Snyder's versions of Bats and Supes were provocative yes, but they were respectable in terms of their mythology and what they represent to a modern world.  Whedon's were cartoon jokes, even worse than the embarrassing Thor and Hulk in Endgame.    It's ridiculous folks.  That is all.",3
"The studio didn‚Äôt believe in Zack Snyder‚Äôs vision for the characters. After the BVS disaster, many many moviegoers didn‚Äôt believe in Zack Snyder‚Äôs vision.  I‚Äôm one of those people.   But, I do feel sympathy for the people who enjoyed the films and won‚Äôt be able to see Snyder‚Äôs vision for the universe come to fruition.   I particularly feel bad for Gal Gadot whose character was basically turned into a sex joke in Justice League. I have no doubt that Snyder‚Äôs version of the film would have been depressing trash, but I do not believe for a second that he would have allowed WONDER WOMAN to be a comedic object. That bulls*t is all on Whedon.  I don‚Äôt believe Affleck truly believed in Snyder‚Äôs vision after BVS.  Mamoa is going to go to bat for Snyder all day no matter what because he‚Äôs that kind of friend.   Ray Fisher and Ezra were no doubt disappointed in their minimal roles compared to what Snyder had in store for them.  Edit. Also, for the record, I think if DC wanted to do an actual page for page adaption of Frank Miller's Dark Knight, Zack Snyder would be the perfect guy for it, it's his bread and butter. (300, Watchmen)....Just don't let him write anything.",1
This makes up for him lying to the fans at comic con.,1
It's like reshooting and rewriting more than two acts of the film. No wonder the film failed.,1
What will you people do if the Snyder Cut is released and is still shit?,0
Trashing the studio will only hurt his chances of appearing as Cyborg again. Not the most diplomatic approach,0
"I still think it would have been a mess, just a preferred mess. I will say, Whedon did give us a GREAT superman, though. Sp, if they could just leave Whedon's superman scenes in for the snyder cut, that'd be great.",0
Ohhhhhh! Get fucked.,0
"I knew i'm not the only one who thought the performances in reshot scenes felt completely bland. Perhaps except for Cavill who apparently enjoyed this version of Superman more (good for him!) and maybe Ezra who was a newcomer anyway. Yeah, i don't blame them. I'm sure they all thought they are creating something special with Zack.",3
"Some people blame Whedon for it, but to me he was a hired gun. Any director who stepped in was in a bad spot. There was no way he‚Äôd make a high quality movie with the short time allowed for the reshoots.  Obviously if they delayed the release, the theatrical cut would have been better.",3
And that sham is potentially what cost us Affleck. And pissed off Cav-El.,3
I'm just curious is Joss to this sub what D&D is to the freefolk?,2
It's also really hard to get emotion into a scene when you are given so little time that you can only do one or two takes and then must move on to the next scene.,1
I have good news for you: actors get paid too,1
Kalel no,1
>studio heads could get their bonuses  How so? What does reshooting a film have to do with bonuses?,1
"Well, yeah. Studio decided to do reshoots but studio heads wanted to keep original release date in order to get bonuses. So they gave the crew & cast a window of very little time to reshoot a lot of the movie.",1
Because the changes were mostly reductive. It takes much less time and effort to tear something down than build it up.,1
620 in this [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KQc64DQqqNU) to hear all the bs.,1
"> Whedon's were cartoon jokes, even worse than the embarrassing Thor and Hulk in Endgame.  Yeah but at least Thor and Hulk made sense in the context of the story they were telling.  It made sense for Banner to merge Hulk and himself.  He turned a struggle into an asset.  His entire character arc is basically showing how he goes from a total wildcard in that he may be helping or hurting their cause, to becoming basically useless in Infinity war, to then becoming literally their best all around asset in Endgame.  I understand some people may not love how they glossed over Hulk and Banner becoming one, but I agreed with the Russo brothers when they explained why they didn‚Äôt film that.  And Thor I actually really loved because it showed just how egotistical he really was before Infinity War.  Like he had gone through a lot of shit in his movies, and throughout all of it he always still held his head up high because he knew he was the man and the ‚Äústrongest Avenger‚Äù.  But letting Thanos get the best of him rocked his world so hard that he became a shell of himself.  Even in the beginning of endgame you see him still having it together because he‚Äôs holding out hope that they‚Äôll eventually undo what Thanos did.  Finding out Thanos destroyed the stones completely flipped his world upside down.  But Batman... I mean holy shit where did that come from?  He went from ‚ÄúI failed Superman I won‚Äôt let him down‚Äù to like a buddy cop comedy character.  It‚Äôs like he completely brushed off that he got played by Lex.  If anything you‚Äôd expect him to be more brutal with criminals after how Lex played him and instead he‚Äôs making small talk on a roof with them.  Literally baffling how anyone at WB green lit that.  Superman... honestly I kind of liked him under Whedon.  Zack did a cool deconstruction of the character, and while I‚Äôm not defending what Whedon made him say a few times, it did feel more like Superman.  It was just a lot more cringy than it needed to be.",3
"Ay Professor Hulk is the shit. I do felt Hulk deserved better in the overall MCU, but, as a stand-alone, I loved what they did with Prof Hulk in the context of the movie.",2
80 pages is about 80-90 minutes usually. The rule of thumb is one page equals about a minute on screen,2
"I mean I do agree that the edited Justice League is garbage and Snyder's one probably would be better, the problem with BVS isn't the fact that it's serious, people do actually like serious comic book movies if done right (Dark Knight?) I'm pretty sure it's more that the writing is all over the place in BVS",3
> I don‚Äôt believe Affleck truly believed in Snyder‚Äôs vision after BVS.  I think he did. He tweeted about Release the Snyder Cut which was biggest surprise for me. I think things didn't pan out as he expected but he was truly on Snyder's side/vision,3
I just wanted to see it all in context and we never got to see the entire story play out. BVS got so much hate but they still had so many more movies to go to finish the story. It would be like only seeing Empire Strikes back and hating the story. Or only two towers.  We didn't know where it was all going.  I just wish we had Snyder's full vision from MoS to the end of the JL sequels before we all jumped on the judgement bandwagon. In context these movies may have made a much better impact in hindsight.,2
"Snyder's JL was always going to be more optimistic dude. That's literally the hero's journey, the darkest step (BvS) always comes before the ascent of hope (SC of JL). Snyder's Superman was always going to become the more optimistic figure. Only under Snyder we would've gotten some actually good Donner-esque stuff and not the Quest for Peace level garbage Whedon gave us. Death is itchy? C'mon.  Affleck was diehard about Snyder. Even after BvS he still seemed to want to try being the awesome Batman he was. It was only in the Whedon shoots where they wanted him to be Tony Stark where he lost interest.",3
What Whedon did with Diana hurts the most. He gets this credit for Buffy but has been an ass when writing for female characters for years and years. He was terrible writing for Black Widow and did the same with Diana. He‚Äôs the guy that wrote that terrible treatment for a WW film and yet WB brings that loser in to disrespect a female character that was given all the respect from Zack and Patty before.  But you‚Äôre incorrect with Affleck not believing in Snyder‚Äôs vision. It‚Äôs that vision that Ben wanted all along and a major reason why he left The Batman project.,1
">After the BVS disaster, many many moviegoers didn‚Äôt believe in the studio's hap-hazard alteration of Zack Snyder‚Äôs vision.  FTFY",1
"I don't believe in Snyder's vision for the character.  I just like having some vision better than what we got in Justice League and Shazam, which are the most thoughtless action movies you could make.  Shazam wasn't as bad of a movie but the story and depth to it was still terrible.  I'd rather see someone try and fail than to waste money on movies that look like they were created with AI.",0
"Honestly, it very well could be shit. But I want to see what Snyder‚Äôs vision was. Aside from me liking Snyder‚Äôs style, it‚Äôs awful that he didn‚Äôt get to complete what he had envisioned. If i think it‚Äôs shit I will be the first to admit it but I do want to see what Snyder had planned",1
When BvS came out it seemed like 99% of the fan base was shitting on Snyder. They said he ruined the movie so remove him and so on. Now people are demanding a Snyder cut of Justice league and I'm sitting here super confused lol,2
You didn't even see Snyders Superman in JL. Wtf?,2
"the scene where Batfleck has a scotch or whiskey,  and says,  ""I can't do this forever"" totally breaks the 4th wall, imo.  (you can see him actually smirk while speaking those words)  And that very moment seems to be when he just stops caring.  Worse.   It looks like he wants out, very much like how I felt halfway through that movie.  It;s a subtle moment that seems maybe funny at first,  but in actuality is incredibly sad for Team Batfleck,  and now, possibly, Henry too.  It's legitimately upsetting and baffling at the same time.  Srsly, when does an actual successful and lucrative business/company  deny their customers of something they've totally got in their palms.       &#x200B;  It's like the opposite of everything America stands for.      Endless possibilities is the American way.      Being restrictive, calculative, and cautious to a fault,      sounds like the Communist method.        &#x200B;  I pray that at least one of those dipshit execs will see the light.    Even if only 25% of the audience is calling for this,    at least half will watch it at some soon point.      What do they have to lose?      Tarnish the masterpiece that is JL:DOJ  20 mil?    Pretty sure they lose that on every 3rd film (I'm guessing).      &#x200B;  I'd love to know when that was shot,  and when he decided not to direct the Batman solo film.  Whedon's actions may have caused a ripple effect far beyond that POS movie.  I actually want to kick this man in the balls.  Him, and that dickhead Kevin Fuckyouhara.  Fuck Kevin the most.  I wish Arie Gold was his replacement, he'd greenlight that shit STAT.",1
"Precisely. Given all of the complaints Snyder fans have about WB interfering in his films and mandating things, you would think that they would actually give Whedon a break. Whedon's mandate form WB, as well as his tiny and rushed window of filming and post-production, is an obvious nightmare for any creative. Whedon was not given a good situation to succeed at all. WB should have delayed the film longer, but got greedy.  And I say this as someone who isn't a big fan of Whedon, either. I thought Avengers and Age of Ultron were meh, and think the Russos made better Avengers films all around. But he was not given a workable situation at all.   That being said, it's definitely fair to criticize his decision to accept that mandate to drastically change JL. No one forced him to do it.",3
Atleast he could have avoided Flash falling onto Wonder Woman's boobs.,1
I disagree. Zack Snyder has finished the majority if not all of the principle photography for JL. Basically all Whedon had to do was edit the ‚ÄúSnyder Cut‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt. He did what WB wanted and made this dumpster fire of a movie. Apparently there‚Äôs like 90 minutes of Zack Snyder‚Äôs original movie that got cut from the movie. So basically Whedon and WB just said ‚Äúnah fuck Snyder‚Äôs version were gonna do our version‚Äù and this is what we get.,2
"Whedan could have said no, he‚Äôs just as guilty",3
>Any director who stepped in was in a bad spot. There was no way he‚Äôd make a high quality movie with the short time allowed for the reshoots.  They would be in a bad spot but that doesn't mean they would necessarily completely butcher the fucking movie. And there's no excuse for going with Elfman over Zimmer/JXL.,2
"Yeah, I don't blame Whedon personally, but I'm still shocked that a respected director would do that to another professional. It's not like Whedon is wanting for work.   I suspect he did it to open up future opportunities, but it's ironic that one of his recent tweets started with ""F*#@ing sell-out"", about someone else.  Ideally everyone who'd accepted the job would have gone ""yeah, I'll do what you claim is happening and respect his vision, but I'm not gonna stab the dude in the back for you"".",1
Whedon could habe told no. But he accepted. It would be fair and in respect towards a colleague artist not to finish his movie.,0
"For some,  yes I think. The difference is that while he executed the changes the studio and also geoff Johns had them made. D&d were both the writers and directors and story runner I believe it was right?",3
I don't think so. But Snyder is more like David Fincher when he made Alien 3. Except he didn't disown the movie like Fincher did.,2
"D&D are completely incompetent, Whedon made Firefly. But he's definitely a villain (as much as villains could exist in real world) when it comes to JL/DC in general.",1
"Rather than push the film back to give more time, the studio execs kept the release date the same to keep their bonuses.",3
"Oh I thought you were linking the con clip from the tweet. Still, interesting to hear Debbie Snyder give an honest take there.",1
"To me it sucks because I always believed we would get that superman from Zack, that's what I always assumed the endgame with that character arc was. After that they would do more upbeat superman stories with a more traditional characterization. I know Snyder originally had different plans for JL that were scrapped before production, superman being evil for a bit I believe. Anyway with the whole rebirth I just assumed that would be the launch point for the newer ""brighter"" superman that some wanted and Cavill wanted to play. That's why it's so mind boggling to me what they did to JL. I know they wanted to move on from Snyder, lighten things up, but they still could have done that even if they released the snyder cut originally. I know it they would still have to abandon other story threads with the other characters, but I don't see how that is worse than the monstrosity we got.  I'd like to see Superman use his intelligence in a movie, really show us just how much of a genius he is.",1
"I feel the writing was a lot tighter in the director's cut. Like, it was baffling trying to figure out why they cut the scenes that they did. Almost every scene they cut had crucial plot elements to them, and without them, made the theatrical cut a narrative mess.",3
"I feel like if people saw Zack's JL in theatres, many of them would appreciate his vision more.",2
"You're wrong about %. It's about who shot principle photography. Then even if you reshoot it the OP still gets credit. You know ""not much"" of Fabian Wagner's work made it to the movie, right?",2
He 100% did believe in Snyder‚Äôs vision. Taking the Batman reception all while dealing with alcoholism was a totally different thing though. I think he was definitely in it till the end.,3
He did. The guy you‚Äôre replying to is just a clown with no clue.,3
"I dunno, he might just want to see it released since so many fans are clamoring for it.",1
"I mean, it's a slam dunk. There's literally no downside of he just wanted to pretend to care for publicity.",0
"> Snyder's JL was always going to be more optimistic dude  I agree. The first JL trailer (with Snyder's footage) felt tonally much more ""lighthearted"" than BvS or MoS did. I actually think the tone of the trailer felt very in line with the theatrical cut (which I know will be an unpopular opinion, lol). His cut of the movie definitely was gonna be a more high-spirited film than his prior 2.",2
">Snyder's JL was always going to be more optimistic dude. That's literally the hero's journey, the darkest step (BvS) always comes before the ascent of hope (SC of JL). Snyder's Superman was always going to become the more optimistic figure. Only under Snyder we would've gotten some actually good Donner-esque stuff and not the Quest for Peace level garbage Whedon gave us. Death is itchy? C'mon.  Was Man of Steel also not a hero's journey? I wouldn't exactly call that movie all that optimistic",1
"> Snyder's JL was always going to be more optimistic dude.   You misunderstand.  The film would have been so bad that it would have been depressing to watch, imo. The guy was given hundred of millions of dollars and couldn't make a good Batman/Superman film with it. I have absolutely no faith that he could have pulled off Justice League, and neither did the studio.",0
"Reality - JL movies would have had Lois dying at hands of Darkseid and Clark become a soldier for Darkseid  Y'all - It was always gonna be optimistic and good and Donner-esque  Must say, the detachment from reality is astounding! Simply WOW!!!",0
It's almost like the media outrage against BvS wasn't actually representative of everyone.  Oh wait.,1
Snyder's superman was in bvs and man of steel,0
"Take a shot whenever Affleck is holding a drink in a film. Live by Night, Triple Frontier, JL, and his new film have a whole lots drinking in them. He was dealing and is dealing with it.",1
"I actually always really liked Whedon. I even think Age of Ultron is underrated. But i can only imagine his direction of JL went something like this:  So Ben, now you lie in the grass and you are like *(clears throat)*  ""Yeah uh, something's definitely bLeEdInG""  *(starts giggling furiously)*",3
Whedon had Flash fall on WW‚Äôs boob.   He gets some of the blame here.,3
"To me, Infinity War isn't technically an Avengers movie cause it focuses on EVERYONE. But still great.  And I don't think it was Whedon's call to make those drastic changes. Everything I've read, WB wanted to do a 180 and make a lighthearted, cheery superhero movie instead of maintaining the course Snyder set. It was probably under those conditions Whedon had to accept the job.",2
"Whedon can be good if he works on TV. His MCU movies aren't really interesting, and JL is just an abomination.",1
He wasn't given a workable situation he was offered the gig and he decided hey why don't I be greedy and take the money to destroy someone's work while the other director mourns his daughter's passing. This is simply morally unethical from a artist point of view (it's not like Whedon was hurting for money - he didn't have to take that job but clearly greed took precedent. No different then what the studio had done - taking $ over doing what's right.),0
Was that his decision? Let's not act like Elfman isn't an accomplished artist whose done some of the best work in superhero movies.,1
Thnx for the explanation. As far as I know DnD were the total and complete showrunners,2
I don't hate alien 3. Thanks for clarifying.,1
He and Debbie do disown the JL theatrical cut. All cast and crew refused to sign any JL stuff at the event that Zack held last year.,1
Maybe I‚Äôm missing something.   They already had a (hopefully) good movie done. How would they get MORE bonus money but investing millions more in reshoots?,1
Honest? Lol she's lying just as much as ben Affleck and everyone there.,1
"It was certainly more coherent, but ‚Äútight‚Äù isn‚Äôt how I would describe a 3 hour superhero movie",1
"I'm sorry, I don't get all of the love for Snyder. BvS was *awful*. That should have been three movies, not one. Considering the disrespect Snyder has for the source material, I just don't understand this cult of personality that his built up around him. Snyder is a visually stunning director, but his story telling is absolute shit. I feel like I'm the only one that can see the emperor has no clothes.",0
I'm of the mindset that if justice league was a smash hit he should've been removed from the role. His Batman in justice didn't look good and you could tell his heart wasn't in it anymore,1
"No. I think he knew about the event. Both him, Gal, Ray and Jason tweeted or posted about it. Only Henry didn't. Ezra isn't on any social media platform. He was supporting Zack. I'm not even a Snyder fan or a part of the movement.",2
Hard to see the publicity in this. Snyder cut movement is a small fandom,2
"It was in line with the theatrical cut in terms of desired tone. The execution of that tone was different. The first trailer gave me a lot of Donner/Jenkins vibes in terms of a serious optimistic tone. Whedon's is more like Superman III and IV (And I'd argue theatrical II, but people like that one for some reason. I never did...). Comedic for the sake of being comedic.  The point of the 5-part Superman story was always to lead into a more optimistic style. And JL was going to be the transition movie.  Instead we got ""Hope is like your car keys"". Again, who let the Quest for Peace writers on set?",1
"1. Man of Steel is the first stage. The reluctant hero tries, and doesn't succeed all the way. But they show their potential and will train to be better. Afterwards follows the darkest second stage (BvS), where the hero is battered and broken, but ultimately makes a great sacrifice that solidifies hope. Literally the hero's journey told over multiple movies.   2. I actually consider MoS a very optimistic movie since it shows that despite the darkness, despite the tragedy, that you can triumph. It's more inspiring to me than just turning back time to save one person with no consequences.",3
"The Rise,  The Fall,  The Reborn  I felt Mos to be optimistic, it inspired and made me feel good in the end where Mama Kent and Papa Kent watched little Clark playing with his cape and then that Lois's ""Welcome to Planet"" line   was just brilliant !!",2
Wasn‚Äôt the film we got that was so bad it was depressing though? Lol.,2
"So instead, they gave us a film so bad it was depressing to watch. Gotcha.",1
Except BvS is good and Snyder could have pulled off Justice League,1
"Yeah, because all I hear from the people like Momoa who have seen the SC is that it's bad to the point of depression. Oh wait, everyone who has seen the SC praises the hell out of it.     And dude, if you really think BvSUE was that bad, you've only seen good movies in your life. There's a reason auteurs like Nolan and James Cameron have nothing but praise for Snyder, and why opinions on his movies always change over time.",1
That was abandoned before JL started filming AND even Snyder considered it too far on retrospect. Just look at the early Snyder JL trailers dude. They're pretty optimistic. But in a Patty Jenkins or Donner way. Not the Whedon/Lester way.,2
That wasn‚Äôt going to happen in the first JL movie.,2
I mean I get that I personally enjoyed BVS I'm just saying everywhere I looked I only saw people upset with Snyder and the movie,1
Did you even see the deleted scene with Superman and Alfred? This is also Snyder's Superman.,1
"See, I don‚Äôt totally hate Whedon.  For how rushed he was it actually isn‚Äôt that bad imo.  Like, the ‚Äúsomethings definitely bleeding‚Äù line.  Within the context of ‚Äúdo you bleed? You will‚Äù and the seriousness of the situation in BvS, it‚Äôs kind of funny.  The issue is, the movie isn‚Äôt a parody of BvS and instead spent the last hour trying to take the events of BvS seriously, Batman specifically.  It‚Äôs almost like they made Batman a parody of himself.  I think the line would have been a much better form of comic relief if Flash said it.  Like, picture the same scene starting with ‚ÄúI remember you‚Äù, Superman says the ‚Äúdo you bleed line‚Äù, and in the background you see Flash getting in his sprint pose, in real time (so not the super slow mo to be clear) sprints over to help Batman and Superman just completely sees him coming and throws a fist out.  Batman and Superman continue having a more tone appropriate scene considering their situation, before going to Lois Superman notices Flash struggling to get up (thinking he‚Äôs going to keep fighting) and Flash in pain musters out ‚Äútrust me I‚Äôm bleeding‚Äù.",3
I love AoU,2
"Yeah, that was pretty lazy, considering he did that with Banner falling on Natasha's boobs in AoU.",2
"I see that scene and some of the other ""funny"" moments as placeholder jokes. The joke there was going to be something about the Flash being awkward and in awe of Wonder Woman. Given more time I'm sure that would have been changed. It's not like Whedon isn't super talented. I mean he made Firefly, and I do think some of the jokes in JL really land, particularly ""Aquaman on the Lasso""",3
"There is only so much slack you could give him, his choices never sounded good and some of them were awfully lazy.",1
"Fair point about Infinity War. It felt more like a gigantic Marvel Universe movie, rather than an Avengers movie. Like you said, it featured nearly every established character in the MCU film franchise up to that point.  And I also agree about it not being Whedon's call to make the drastic changes. That was clearly on WB. If Whedon had been given more time to write his on movie, I'm sure he would have come up with something much better than what we got. Instead we got a rushed mess that wasn't representative of *anyone's* true vision.",2
A counterpoint: Serenity.,1
"I feel like you're putting top much head cannon into this. Whedon took the job, yes, but I seriously doubt he did it to disrespect another film maker.  If anything, he likely heard Snyder was off the project because the studio didn'l like the direction, got asked and took the job put before him. He did what he could with the time and budget (which for that kind of movie and scale would have tripped anyone up, IMO) and that's literally it.  Not saying he had zero accountability in what we got, but he's also not the villain here. He's a henchman. WB is the villain. They were the ones who gutted Snyders work, kicked him off the project and used a family tragedy to cover their asses. They're the ones who decided on the shit reshoot schedule and tiny ass budget. They're the ones who foot the bill for and OK'ed the *worst* VFX in movie history. Whedon is basically just a thug they had help. And not a very good thug, at that...",2
If he didn't take it someone else would have,1
"Yeah no argument here. Whedon is an accomplished film maker and show maker, and clearly did not *need* to take on the Justice League reshoots. Accepting the offer, especially with the circumstances, was a selfish move, imo. I'll defend him from a lot of the criticism that he gets for the final product, but will never defend him for accepting the job in the first place.",0
"Williams is older, but he still can write amazing scores, while Elfman didn't do anything great in a long time.",1
I like the Assembly cut of Alien 3 which is close to Fincher's intended vision for the movie.,1
Oh. I didn't know that. I think they could have forced the studio to put 'Alan Smithee'  on all the materials JL related including TV release and home sales.,1
"They wouldn‚Äôt. They didn‚Äôt reshoot it to get bonus money. The bonus money was for keeping the release date the same. So they limited the time for reshoots by keeping the release date in November just for money. They either should have given them more time, or just not have done the reshoots at all.",2
"The movie had a late Nov 2017 release date, so pushing it would've made the release date most likely some time in 2018, which means that those 2017 bonuses for released films wouldve had 1 less movie with BO receipts.  And to make matters worse, some of those people in charge were also leaving at the end of 2017 so they wouldnt have seen those 2018 bonuses.   All in all, they tried to reshoot half the movie at the ass end of production while not moving the release date.  Insanity.",2
"I heard Kevin Tsujihara wanted to get revenue to a certain level to meet a bonus threshold. Without JL, he wouldn't have hit that, so instead of delay, he and the others rushed it thru and made it sub 2 hours to make more showings per day.   I can't evidence much of it, but if anything smacks of ""2 hour mandate"", it's a movie with deleted material that just happens to come in at 1h59.",2
Because they thought altering it to be two hours would maximize revenue.,1
"Did you link it without watching it?  > We had been working on this franchise for the past, almost eight years, when we started developing the script for Man of Steel. And then we moved on to BvS and also Zack developed the story for Wonder Woman which was leading up to the point of Justice League, where these characters were gonna finally come together. I mean this was a really great hero's journey. A journey for these characters to be who they are today. **So not being able to complete his vision was extremely difficult.**  That's all real shit right there. Everyone else was saying Zack's vision was well intact and Joss was just peppering some small finishing touches on the project. She's saying the opposite. She even said ""not being able"" which shows it wasn't a voluntary decision and also that the finished product was not Zack's.",1
"It felt faster than the 2.5 hour mess they showed in theaters, so I would say yes, if not at least relatively.",2
Endgame? Watchmen?,1
"Yeah but that's the reshoots. In the few snyder scenes we got he looks fine, his acting is still good. Although we didn't get to see much of his acting from the snyder cut, I think the majority of his talking scenes in JL are Whedon. I'm struggling to remember a snyder scene they left in with Affleck where he has much dialogue.",1
"At the time there was quite alot of publicity for it, it was big news when they were all tweeting. There very much was publicity to be had. Doesn't last forever, but it was there.  I used to think the fandom was small, now I'm not so sure. Not everyone is a die hard, not many anyway. But I think the number of people who want to see this movie have grown quite alot. I mean remeber JL was universally labeled as trash, objectively it's a garbage movie. Many, many people are huge fans of the JL, and this was the 1st time we saw them live action,  that's a huge moment. So now people know their is another, complete version of JL that will be objectively better because it will be consistent and competently made. That in and of itself will make it better regardless of taste. I have no doubt now that we know it is far closer to completion than we were lead to believe, if not completely finished. I imagine many want another kick at the can, another chance to see the MF JL in a live action movie that doesn't completely suck lol. Even the people that hate Snyder, what do they got to lose, who doesn't want to see another JL movie lol.",1
"I think you could argue the very last scene was optimistic, but overall the movie was kind of a downer.",1
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, that is clearly what happened, but I think in their head what they were doing was making it much more appealing to kids and families vs being as dark as BvS so at least they could bank on that audience and the popularity of the characters getting them a lot of money back.  The tone from BvS to JL went from ‚Äúthis is literally pushing the limits of PG-13‚Äù to ‚Äúthis could easily pass as PG‚Äù.  Unfortunately, my honest guess about Snyder‚Äôs JL is they probably saw a lot of the same mistakes they made with BvS and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just fork over the money for reshoots and try to break even so we don‚Äôt look tone death‚Äù rather than doing the same thing a lot of people didn‚Äôt like for a 3rd time.  In hindsight I don‚Äôt blame Zach for this.  You can‚Äôt hire a guy who makes movies with a specific tone and change your mind and do the polar opposite in the middle of a movie.  That‚Äôs like taking an Eli Roth movie and deciding to make it a comedy when you‚Äôre about to wrap shooting.  The *only* thing WB should‚Äôve done with JL is reshot any open ending that impacts a character they want to continue solo movies for.  I don‚Äôt care if they feel continuing without Zach is in their best interest, but you can‚Äôt start a movie one way and decide towards the end to make it something else.  Changing the tone is what killed justice league.  I realize this is a total ‚Äúno shit‚Äù comment before anyone says it lol",1
"Exactly, Snyder never wanted him to be hopeful and optimistic. WB had to force his hand for that.  As for the original cut, if it were actually hopeful, they wouldn't have gone through massive reshoots trying to make it so. Was very likely typical needlessly mopey and broody stuff which he always does.  Keep believing what you feel like and I'll go off what I've seen of him and what I believe him capable of.",0
"Hence me saying ""JL movies"". Maybe read next time?",1
Ok. Snyder had two entire movies and neither really landed with the masses. One scene isn't going to convince me hos would have better than what we got.,0
"Or something more simple: when Superman drops Batman and flies away, have Flash zoom in to see if Bruce is okay and have say ""Wow, uh, you're definitely bleeding.""",2
"That's how I see it. He was told to add comedy, and given about five minutes to do it.  He resorted to slapstick.  I mean, it worked, for certain values of worked; my daughter (10 at the time) giggled.",3
"Yes. And I'm not a conspiracy theory guy, but I think the whole ""Batgirl movie"" was cover up for bringing in Whedon to do reshoots of JL in the first place. So they are telling us that Joss Whedon, the guy who created Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, wrote and directed the first two Avengers movies ""couldn't come up with a story"" for Batgirl????",2
You're acting like it's super easy to pass on a couple of million dollars,2
Ah ok that makes more sense then.,1
Ah ok THAT makes sense if people were leaving. Because you‚Äôd likely get a bigger bonus just waiting till 2018 and having a better film that makes more money.,1
"""We were lucky we already had Joss working on script pages...""   You intentionally left that out.",1
What about them?,1
But my thing is he still would've looked like that for Snyder's reshoots. He just didn't look the part of the character anymore.,1
"Was it though? I didn't find MoS a downer overall, no more than Superman I or Superman II Donner Cut at least. It's far less depressing than Singer's gloomy accident. Seriously, if any Superman movie put me in a bad mood, it was Superman Returns. Mainly because I feel so damn sorry for Richard. He just wanted to be a good father, and here his wife is constantly lying to him and being so distant.  Rant over.",1
I'd never say that to such a well written and thought out response üëçüèª. I agree with everything you said.,1
"1. No, Supes was supposed to be more optimistic in JL 1 and 2 ALWAYS. JL3 would have a brainwashed Supes for only a little bit. And even Snyder admitted the original plan was crazy.   2. Under Snyder and Terrio, by their words, JL was always going to be more optimistic. Original and new plan. The difference is that while it was optimistic, it was still serious and complex. Johns was obsessed with wanting it to be more humorous. That's why they reshot 70% of the movie with Joss. Just look at the early Snyder JL trailers. They're still optimistic and more triumphant. More Wonder Woman-esque. But not as comedic as Whedon's garbage reshoots.   3. Snyder's movies aren't always the same dude. Watchmen was cynical and satirical on humanity and superheroes. BvS reached a more positive conclusion (""Men are still good"").   4. Do you not know the hero's journey? It starts conflicted, moves to a dark sacrifice, and emerges with hope. That's literally the arc Snyder was going for, a classical hero's journey. Which also influenced Post-Crisis Superman heavily.   5. Keep believing whatever you feel like and I'll go off of what we know for a fact from the SC plot.",1
Okay then.,1
"I laughed at pretty much everything because I like Whedon's humor in general, but that part where Batman was stuttering when Superman showed up as if he was too shy to talk to his crush was a low blow.  The Pet Sematary bit had me in stitches and so did the one in the beginning with Barry drawing that guy's face with the marker. Flash was comedy gold to me in JL and I enjoyed the movie as a Saturday morning extended episode, but it just doesn't fit with the other two.",2
I heard that him leaving Batgirl project was because WB decided that all movies with female leads should be directed by women.,1
"The reshoots were GOING to happen. Snyder was out. WB screened the rough cut for several filmmakers to get input on how to reshape it and morph it into what WB wanted.  Whedon simply won the bid for $3m. If he had said no, there were about 6 other teams ready to do the reshoots. They were GOING to happen regardless.",2
"Wtf üòÇ. No I'm saying they wanted another director for reshoots so they were never not  going to get another director. Don't use shitty analogies in the place of an actual argument, that's just lazy thinking.",1
"Being a man isn't easy, being a leech is.",0
"Exactly.  Had the people not been leaving, they could've just moved the film to march or may 2018 (or whichever viable open spot) and seen those bonuses at the end of the year.   It's a selfish move, for sure. But I get it. They probably thought they were gonna get avengers bonus money regardless before leaving WB.",1
"Yes, you'll find I excluded about 98% of the video, because I'm referring to a specific portion of honest dialogue.   If I'd been aware I was dealing with an idiot, I would've just moved along instead of commenting in the first place.",1
They're 3hrs or more. People call their writing tight.,1
"See I don't think snyder needed reshoots at that point, I could be very wrong though. But I hear what you are ssying, I think the divorce and alcoholism were taking it's toll around that time.",1
"Really?  You have a brooding Clark wandering around the world, having an existential crisis.  It's kinda hard to blame him, given the messages his father tried to instill in him. Getting chastised for saving a bus full of children because apparently keeping his powers a secret was more important than letting 50 kids die?  The color scheme was matches Clark's mentality by being extremely muted. It was mostly grays and brown, and felt more like it belonged in a Batman movie than a Superman one. Superman is supposed to be colorful and fill people with hope, but everything just felt kinda depressing. It wasn't until the very last scene that you finally get some color, and Supes has that happy-go-lucky, Kansas Farm Boy attitude.",1
"1. So Darkseid was supposed to be wrapped up in 1 movie and Steppenwolf in 2? Sounds made up and not based on reality but okay. And of course he'll say ""it's crazy"". He got told he couldn't do it.  2. Anyone involved with BvS and the backlash it got would make proclamations about next one being optimistic and so on.   You're giving way too much credit, blame and power to Johns based on rumours you've heard. Typical.  3. They actually are. I've seen Watchmen. The movie that copied the novel page for page and missed the entire point of it by a mile. Good thing we now have a show that gets what the novel is about beyond ""it's so dark and edgy!""  4. I'm pretty aware of it but that only works if you believe he was gonna become the character people know him to be. I don't believe snyder gets or likes Superman and hence never would have let him become that.  5. I'm literally going off on his past works and words but you do you.",1

"I realize that, it's just nice to see which people in the business actually have integrity. Whedon is not one of those people.",1
Lol I just wanted to say this comment is awesome.,1
You can't pick and choose what someone says just to make it fit your argument. You have to take everything they say into account. Clearly you're trying to pull a fast one by cutting out what she said in the end.  You really shouldn't have commented since you're a fool.,1
For watchmen? Lmao who says that?   Also all the contrivances and weird character decisions in bvs exempt it from being called tight imo,1
"1. Clark is traveling for like 2 minutes of the movie searching for signs of his past. That's not really a brooding existential crisis.   2. His father didn't say he should've let them die. His father said ""Maybe"" after hesitating because like a real father who is trying to balance protecting his kid and instilling morals in him, he doesn't know the right answer. That's not dark or brooding. That's human.   3. The color scheme wasn't muted. It's no darker than most MCU movies. If anything I liked how it actually had a realistic shading to everything. Clark's suit has been a darker blue in most comics since Bryne's era, I'm not sure why people are only mow complaining that it needs to be more colorful.   4. It's his first day on the job and you're expecting a world that went through 9/11 to be filled with hope at the first sight of an alien?   5. Superman hasn't always had that attitude. Bryne's MoS series had a morally complex Clark. Most post-crisis early stories were darker. Superman was shown to get more optimistic over time, particularly after his Resurrection. That's what Zack was going for. All Star Superman makes sense because it's a tempered, older, wiser Superman. This Clark is young, impulsive, unsure of himself. It makes him relatable since as humans, we've all been unsure of ourselves. Hell, even Donner tried to have some of that, and the Salkinds forced him to neuter it because they wanted it to be like the campy 50s show. But take Reeve in context and he was by far the darkest version of the character at the time. He killed Zod, he gave up his powers for love, he resorted to angry violence against the trucker dude. And he had 10 more years of training in the Fortress than Cavill did, Cavill was literally being Superman with no training.   6. Can I ask why everyone calls Clark brooding here? Not once does he just stand on a rooftop and mope about himself like Superman Returns or most Batman movies. He doesn't act depressed, there's tons of great Superman smiles. The only part I could somewhat call brooding is when he asks the priest for help. But that's one of the most human moments of the movie because it shows again that Clark doesn't know all the answers. It's why he ends up being forced to kill Zod, Zod is still stronger than him, and the only reason Clark can kill him is because Zod let's him. It's suicide by cop. And after that, it's clear in his anguish that that is a catalyst for his growth from then on.     These are arguments I've heard before, and none of them really hold any water unless you went into the movie already expecting to dislike it.",1
"1. No. Steppenwolf was dead by the end of JL1. At the end of JL2 Darkseid would kill Lois and brainwash Supes. He would only stay that way for a small part of JL3.   2. JL was already hyped up as more optimistic before BvS released. BvS was always meant to be the *Empire* of the series. The dark complex leadim to the triumphant payoff. The night is always darkest before the dawn.   3. Johns is a great comic writer. But he thought Batman needed to be hopeful and optimistic? He signed off on ""I don't not like you""? Yeah, excuse me if I'm not head over heels. Especially after he let a trailer company edit Suicide Squad.   4. Did you see the UC or DC of Watchmen. Cause it sounds like you missed the point. Also, Watchmen wasn't just dark or edgy, it was cruel and cynical. Which isn't a facet of Snyder's other movies. BvS ends with Bruce regaining faith in humanity for Christ's sake. That's too dark for you?   5. He does like Superman, and we know Superman was going to become more optimistic because that's 70% of what was talked about with JL when Snyder was shooting it. Also ""character people know him to be""? Superman has been reinterpreted many times. Post-Crisis he was very morally conflicted and tried to avoid his destiny. DC characters aren't static,  change with the times. This Superman didn't grow up in the 50s with WW2 hero stories and the greatest generation. He grew up with terrorism, 9/11, political division. If people think Superman needs to be static to be the ""real Superman"" then they're the ones that don't get the character. Fir reference, someone who has actually helped write said characters: https://mobile.twitter.com/jayoliva1/status/1198045218336989186   6. Zack literally attested to wanting Supes to be Reborn more optimistic several times. Those are his words. You're the one ignoring what we've heard from interviews, statements, Cavill himself, everyone involved in JL.     Just because you don't like Snyder doesn't mean he doesn't get the characters. Of we gatekeeped to that degree ever before, we'd never have gotten Keaton Bats or Jenkins WW, or hell even Reeve Supes. The Donner Movie was considered far more serious and less campy than any portrayal of Supes at the time. Donner made a Superman that was flawed enough to turn back time for one person without consequence. Who gave up his powers to live like a human. That was considered a departure, and the George Reeves diehards screamed about that just like the internet fanboys scream about modern Supes. People didn't like Post-Crisis Supes at first either, but many of those stories are absolute classics now. James Cameron once called Snyder ""ahead of his time"". Watchmen used to be hated, now it's widely liked. Opinions are already changing on MoS and BvSUE. Before too long, you'll be the one people think ""doesn't understand the character"". Supes diehards lost their mind at Chris Reeve. Look at how people think of him now.",0
"I get that, and I agree I love to see real integrity in the industry.  But this becomes a bit of a slippery slope. We can use the same argument for Alan Moore telling WB and filmmakers to not proceed with a Watchmen movie.  He'd been incredibly vocal about it, and snyder still took the job and had to skirt around any questions involving Moore's distaste for the production.   Whedon did the same.  His agent got a call from WB saying they're screening JL and looking to hire a writer to clean up what they have and reshoot some scenes.  Both Whedon and Snyder in their own positions knew that they were going to jump onto a project the original artist is opposed to, but took the paycheck any way ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1
"Watchmen has become quite beloved. Even many Snyder-haters refer to it as ""the one he got right"".  Contrivances? Care to explain?  As for Weird Character Decisions, I don't know where you're coming from. Lex acted like he did in most early incarnations (And Birthright). Yeah the 80s reinvented him as a super industrialist, but Snyder's Birthright boner wouldn't have him go any other way. Bruce killing? Been done. Golden Age Batman, Burton's Batman, Nolan's Batman, even Adam West have a body count to them. Aside from that everyone is fairly normal to their comic counterparts. Except Perry White is now Morpheus (Which let's face it, only makes Perry White more awesome).",0
"That's a whole lotta false equivalency and assuming shit on your part. No matter what I say, you'll continue believing it. I'm neither gonna waste my time nor energy for nothing.  If you believe Watchmen was hated before and is universally loved now, or that Donner had a similar reaction to MoS or BvS, you're living in an alternate reality.",1
"A. I like watchmen fine, but it totally misses the point of the graphic novel. Visually it‚Äôs great though!  B. Are you joking? There is an abundance of media online pointing out the flaws and contrivances of BvS. No need for me to repeat them here.   Pretty hilarious how you cherry picked the ones you have pre-written rebuttals for though haha (which you didn‚Äôt even get right)",1
"Dude, all I see anymore is positive things about Watchmen. And no, Donner didn't get the same reaction as Snyder. Because with Donner only a small portion of moviegoers had such an attachment to George. With Snyder, basically everyone had an existing attachment to Chris. People were far more open minded with Donner, whereas Snyder got the ""not muh Superman"" stuff on a larger scale. Which is still wrong. Again, Jay explains it better than I ever could.",0
"Explain. You're the one that made the claims, it's up to you to prove them right. As well, nothing I said was wrong. Lex was a mad scientist in the OG continuity and Birthright brought that back for early Lex.  I've seen most of the ""contrivances of BvS"". And most of the time the critics are confused about plot details that the theatrical cut missed, or they straight up get things wrong when it's right in front of them.",1
Why did lex make doomsday,1
Let me guess this comment is from r/movies,3
"Favorite DCEU, and Superman isn't even my favorite Hero.",3
Is MoS really hard to understand? Maybe an average movie viewer won't get some of the themes but it doesn't take much thought to fully understand the movie.,3
Going into that thread is like going into a whirlpool of depression to me,3
"Man of Steel is my favorite movie. I find it to be an absolutely incredible movie. Superman isn't even my favorite comic book character, but MOS is so good that it just can't not be my favorite.",1
I don't see why there's so much hate over MoS. It is extremely underrated and easily one of the best superhero movies. Much better than most Marvel movies tbh.,2
Snyder is the best CBM director period and Man of Steel is the best Superman movie HANDSDOWN no comparison,1
"People have different opinions, like i got banned for saying the Question and the Flash don't have the same tone as characters. I love MOS but BvS was just a mediocre film, i won't be flabbergasted if i got banned again for saying this.",1
Waiting for #2 üòí,1
"Nah, people just like quality movies that‚Äôs all.",0
Man of steel was a terrible movie.,0
"MoS is as simple as it gets. Why would you use a quote that implies it would be misunderstood? And If you tried using the BvS quote from Martha, you got it wrong aswell",0
Nice comeback by Wireless,0

People over there can't comprehend the fact that a ton of people like these movies,3
"It‚Äôs really not hard to understand lol it‚Äôs just a decent movie. Nothing amazing or anything like that but it‚Äôs not bad at all.  Not as good as WW, Aquaman or Shazam imo",1
"100% agreed! I would even say better than all MCU movies period. I enjoy a few of them quite a bit but overall, for my taste, its a bit to simple and cookie cutter.",1
I love MoS!,3
They downvoted him for he told the truth,1
"If you‚Äôre speaking subjectively, then sure that‚Äôs like, your opinion man. But if you‚Äôre speaking objectively then I gotta tell you you‚Äôre wrong lol there‚Äôs other CBM directors and films that are better than Snyder and MoS",1
I don't think that's why you were banned. People here express differing opinions on Snyder all the time. Maybe there was something else going on there.,3
> i won't be flabbergasted if i got banned again for saying this  I won't either,3
"I‚Äôm curious, where were u banned from ? Lmao üòÜ",1
And people should realize that films are subjective.,1
"Agree. I like BvS and love watchmen, but the MoS is simply not the superman i know",0
"That meme is completely incorrect,sure films like Captian Marvel and Ant man and the wasp are standard,cookie cutter MCU films,but films like Avengers 1 Avengers Infinity War and Endgame,Captain America the first avenger Captain America the winter soldier,civil war,Iron Man 1 and 3,The guardians movies and Thor Ragnoraj all have genuine heart and care put into them,Dc is the same with Man of steel,Batman vs Superman the ultimate cut,Wonder Woman,Shazam aquaman and Joker all have care and a vision put into them,People like movies that are made with care,by filmmakers not films made by committee and setting up a cinematic universe like Josstice league and Age of ultron.",2
more than they are willing to admit. they'll have you believe it's just this sub,2
Aquaman doesn't even come close to comparing to MOS,2
Honestly aquaman is so fucking bad MoS is definitely better,1
"What?! MoS is one of the best CBMs.  If youre comparing off of money sure, but if its story MoS got the others beat.",1
Which you cannot prove objectively :) So why even go down that route?! Art is subjective. Just because the majority shares a subjective opinion on a piece of art doesn‚Äôt make it an objective truth that its better or worse.   Like for example that horrible ‚ÄúI‚Äôm blue dabadeedabadie‚Äù song that was a hit in the 90s... is that objectively great music just cause millions of people bought that crap?^^,1
"There was nothing else mate you can check my comment, i said MCU fans won't complain spidey and the punisher don't have the same tone but some ""DCEU fans"" won't accept that bats and supes are different characters with different tones, because a Real DC fans knows the difference between bats and supes, voila i was banned for ""aggressive gatekeeping""",0
"Right, snyder tried to make him this edgy, very dark scary guy in a cape that the world fears.",0
Yea I couldn‚Äôt stand Aquaman either. I‚Äôm glad the water boy is getting love but that movie drives me nuts.,1
"If you try to call people not ""Real DC fans"", then that is gatekeeping. Also nobody thinks Supes and Bats are the same. If that's why you got from the DCEU, that's just straight up wrong. Superman was constantly trying to save people. Batman was trying to punish criminals. That's the difference. Superman is a defender, a hero. Batman is the Hammer of justice, a Soldier in many ways.",3
"For reference, one of the people who knows DC best: https://mobile.twitter.com/jayoliva1/status/1198045218336989186     Or is he not a rEaL fAn to you?",2
Would you not fear a nearly omnipotent alien being?,3
"Woah, interesting. Not at all how I saw it. More like a modernized Superman (in design style) who deals with the emotional/psychological weight of being born with outrageous capabilities and what it means to act in the world with those powers.   It's not even close to my fav movie but thats def no reason to misrepresent it.",2
"I don't think it's ""bad"" necessarily but it's horrendously goofy",2
Now did he say that bats and supes are the same characters who have the same tone? He didn't did he? My question still stands have you not seen some Snyder and DCEU fans hate shazam and other DC films because it didn't have the same tone of BvS.,0
"If that's Superman, then no. He's the best of us and been like that since his childhood because Kents raised him as a good man. He doesn't need to blow up buildings to know to experience what harm it does or kill someone to learn not to kill.",0
"It's the Thor Ragnarok of DC.  ""This character is too serious. Let's make it an indiana-jones style comedy""",1
"Umm, Snyder fans love WW and Aquaman. Which don't have the same tone as BvS. Shazam! Gets a bit more shit because it's more immature style of comedy tends to not work with some people. I like the movie, but people have the right not to like it. And that's not because it's not like the Snyderverse. Hell, Freddy in the movie is essentially a giant Snyder fan. My point is that there is no criteria for a ""real DC fan"" other than they like DC characters. Whatever their opinions on tone are, it doesn't matter.",1
"Yeah, they are falling into the same trap others are of having odd expectations of entirely different directors and projects.",1
"People have different opinions i know that, but you ain't acknowledging that some people in this subreddit will hate a DC movie if it isn't gritty and gloom like BvS,   [Mate some Snyder fans will not accept a DC movie that isn't directed by Lord Snyder](https://mobile.twitter.com/TCLangWrites/status/1134956139945312258)  [what I'm talking about ](https://mobile.twitter.com/CarlShinyama/status/1192202887838994439)   [check out some of the comments he ain't trolling he's a Snyder fan](https://youtu.be/zysOeMj3jqU)",1
Pretty much listen to it every day at some point. Powerful is a good word to describe it.,3
"I always said that I love both Superman themes (Williams and Zimmer).  Williams‚Äô Superman is THE classic superhero theme. The instant you hear it, you feel ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bird, it‚Äôs a plane! It‚Äôs Superman!‚Äù  But Zimmer‚Äôs Superman... I‚Äôve always been more of a Batman guy, even before I really cared about superheroes, but the Man of Steel score makes me feel like **I** could be Superman, like I could fly into the sky, cape flowing and wind in my face. It has an uplifting tone that really inspires a feeling of hope.",3
"I've listened to the MOS score regularly since it came out, can't say that about any other soundtracks, I love it.",3
"Goodbye, My Son always manages to choke me up.  And every variation of ""If you love these people"" - from the magnificent build-up to his death in ""This is my world"" or the somber and slower power from ""Krypton had its chance"" - is a sensation for the ears.",3
The official soundtrack not including lois's theme is such a bizarre omission. It's my favourite theme and it's the one that goes through the most variation in the movie.,2
Probably Han‚Äôs best for me. Shame it doesn‚Äôt get enough love compared to Inception and TDK trilogy.,2
"*""Flight""* and *""What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving The World""* are great workout songs. Love them. Glad the soundtrack could cheer up your day.",2
"Flight and If You Love these People are two of my absolute favorite tracks. They're incredibly epic, with IYLTP being incredibly tragic on top of that.",2
"Honestly, as a huge fan of John Williams, I feel like Hans Zimmer's theme (and just the overall MoS and BvS soundtrack) captures Superman's world much better. At least the Post-Crisis/Rebirth Superman. There is hope, there is optimism, but there is also doubt and despair. But even after everything, hope always returns. Williams feels more fitting for the Golden and Silver Age Superman (which, to be fair, was exactly the current Superman at the time those movies were made).",2
Really glad to hear it helped u overcome a bad day. It‚Äôs truly a magical score \S/,2
I use it while lifting and damn does it feels powerful to lift to those epic tunes,1
"As much as people love John Williams' scores to classics like Jaws, Star Wars, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, my all time favorite movie score of his is for Superman:  The Movie.  While I don't think the Man of Steel score comes anywhere close to that benchmark it's still a great score and is easily the best musical accompaniment to any film in the DCEU by a wide margin.   Much like Man of Steel itself, it's an underappreciated accompaniment to a movie that is way better than people give it credit for.",0
"when you say ""krypton had its chance"" i assume you're referring to [""destroy this ship""](https://youtu.be/WSAHqMWHJJg?t=68) right?   it's one of the best tracks from the film, and it's not even an official song on the soundtrack. big shame.",1

I understood the reference.,1
Drown the witch!,1
I think it‚Äôs a little early to say how Joker ages,3
"When I saw the title about *Man of Steel* aging well, the first thing I thought of was the Sears product placement.",3
"Too early for The Joker.  MoS is not my favorite and it did not age well for me, giving us a very boring Superman just because Snyder though making things ""dark"" will play out. It didn't   BvS... Ugh where do I even start... Just no. That movie is not good.   I'm excited for the DC to step into post-snyder era. It will be much more successful.",2
"Funny enough, multiple viewings had the opposite effect on me in regards to BvS. I was super hyped for it. On repeat viewings of BvS, after the hype from the anticipation wore off, I found more and more problems I had with the film. I defended it a lot when it came out, but now I‚Äôm not actually a big fan of it anymore. That‚Äôs not to say I think the movie is terrible, I just find it interesting how repeat viewings can have different effects for different people",3
"Too early to say Joker does that when it was released this year, lol.",3
Honestly hate BVS but MOS aged so well,3
"MoS got worse over time for me, the switch from telling a story to destruction porn is so dumb and bland and Clark and Superman are so heavily underwritten, with so few dialogie, its unbearable. I hated BvS first and still dont like it, it simply has too many flaws i just cant get over.  Joker though, even on a second watch in cinema, was still intense and great",3
True. Man of Steel and Batman V Superman get better and better as time passes,2
BvS especially. There isn‚Äôt a single flaw in Afflecks performance imo,2
"Given the impact Joker has had, it'll age just fine.",1
"The great thing about Joker is that there is no date about it. You could say it takes place in a old time but you can't point to one year in particular so I think it's gonna do a great job at making it timeless so that no matter when you watch it, it will stilll have the same impact when something like BvS, with stuff like Stewart or CNN, it's more of a product of its time",1
"""How long have we've been on this subreddit? 5 weeks? 2 days?""",1
Man of Steel and BvS for sure. Joker is well made and has an amazing performance but didn‚Äôt resonate with me. Not comic booky enough and actually really depressing. A hard rewatch.,1
"Perhaps a bit early yet to say that Joker has ""aged well,"" lol. Although I'm sure it will.   Yes, absolutely, MoS--and BvS in particular--are aging well. BvS is pretty much cemented now as what may be considered a cult classic.   The Wikipedia definition of ""cult film"":  ""A cult film or cult movie, also commonly referred to as a cult classic, is a film that has acquired a cult following. Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate fanbase, an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and audience participation. Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially box office bombs, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, transgressive films shunned by the mainstream. The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art. The term cult film itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies, though cult was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that.""",1
Did you watch the same BvS as everyone else?,1
"Agreed. That's rare in this comic landscape of novelty and spectacle, where all that's cared about are teamups, connectivity and a grand ol spanking, fun time. Without question the three best comic book movies since TDK series ended.",0
"Man of steel is masterpiece, best Superman movie in my opinion, when bvs came out I was in love with the movie , I was so angry at the bad reviews I couldn‚Äôt understand why people hated the movie ,but now I REALLY don‚Äôt like the movie specially Superman i really don‚Äôt like Superman In the movie (still love Henry) and joker is masterpiece ü§ó",0
Yeah its like 50 days old.  It'll age way better if they don't make a franchise out of it.,3
"Haha ironically there will be a point were people watching MoS will have never heard of Sears. In a way, it‚Äôs kind of no longer a product placement.",2
"IHop...was way, way worse.  7 eleven...",2
Agree. BvS has aged like milk for me.,3
THANK YOU!!!  I had exactly same reaction. I enjoyed and defended the movie at first the more time I watch it the more I actually dislike the movie. That movie alone brought on the downfall of DCU. There are just so many problems with it.  I'm excited for the new Batman movie tho,3
Exactly this. Spent a long time defending it but multiple views clearly shows the problems with the movie.,3
The Ultimate Cut?,1
"Can you name a few things that make you feel like that? I'm not hear to tell you your wrong, just want to see other peoples opinions.",1
"How much a character talks is not indicative of their character development.  Clark doesn't say one word in the Zod death scene but you get a complete wave of character in that sequence.  He has been forced into a no-win scenario, and went with his instincts.    This still causes him deep pain however, and lets out a cathartic cry.  Of course Lois runs up and he goes to her which shows his loyalty to Earth even though it came at an almost unbearable price.    It's called challenging the character.  If you think that Superman should be given easy ways out and not be tested than you don't have faith in Superman.  It's that simple.",0
Best live action Batman ever. I absolutely loved him. Very sad he won‚Äôt be returning. Would have loved to see a prequel.,2
The casting is great. It's all the things they say and do that's terrible.,2
"Honestly, I thought MoS and BvS were way more depressing than Joker.   Joker starts out with a suicidal, depressed man who hates his life and ends with him finding happiness and self-acceptance.",1
>where all that's cared about are teamups and connectivity  **You are talking about BATMAN V. SUPERMAN.**,1
That doesn't make any sense.,1
Could‚Äôve been worse. They could‚Äôve done what the 2017 Power Rangers movie did and had the codex be located underneath the IHOP.,2
"I'l give it a go , i kinda like the movie and its style and there are a lot of good stuff there but the main problems for me are  :   Terrible pacing and narrative structure  Clark is a stale character and plotwise too  Bruce has no restrictions before fighting supes and then just decides to help him. That needed better setup.  Lois has a useless subplot investigation to find the bad guy when we already know who it is,and when she does find out it no longer has value   The scene-marking plot makes no sense  There is no mystery or big revelation regarding the actual plot. Everything pretty much happens as you would expect excluding one or two instances that were just shock value.  The martha scene although somewhat smart  was executed poorly on a lot of ends  The dream sequences add nothing to this movie and are there just for set-up and clogging up the pacing  Just before the final fight they stop to advertise the next movie (something more appropriate for a credit scene)  And some more",3
Too big for little minds.,0
Thanks for the reply. I really don't mind when people say this movie wasn't that good or wasn't a fan of it. Its the ones that say it's the worst movie they ever seen.,1
"I totally agree with that scene being a credit scene makes more sense (also, why would batman have a hard-on for just this one alien when he clearly knows there are bunch of meta humans out there)  but, the movie is more about the media and humanity as a whole, men struggling wih power and their intrepretation of power rather than the the characters in them",1
"It is, after all, a very big brain film. Pa Kent suicide for doggie, very smart. Watching justice league YouTube vids on plane, too clever. Martha, only savants can dream to decipher the character depth.",3
Yeah the movie had interesting thematics and tried SOME things but it still had to be executed better,1
Not to mention how the entire point of Jonathan dying of a heart attack in the original film was that **there was absolutely nothing that Superman ever could have done to save him**.,1
Superman's dad committed suicide to make sure he got the last word in an argument.,1
"An argument where Superman had already been like ""nah fuk u, banned"" in **literally his first scene in the entire movie**.  ""My dad died demanding me to keep myself from the world. But he can eat shit, time to save some exploding oil‚Äì wait that already happened, right? What even was the point of that story if I've already undone everything I could have taken from it?""",1
He‚Äôs also really good in Prisoners. As a side note I think Daniel Day Lewis could really pull off Thomas Wayne with that stache.,3
"Dano is going to crash it, just like every damn actor in this unbelievable cast.",3
"Paul Dano was originally only supposed to play Paul Sunday but the original actor playing Eli left the project for ‚Äúcreative differences‚Äù. Rumor is that the original actor didn‚Äôt click well with DDL‚Äôs intense method acting and decided to quit.   Because of this, they offered Paul Dano the role of Eli and decided to make the brothers twins. This all happened during production so not only was Paul Dano given the role of main antagonist, but he had little to no prep time for it yet still delivered a phenomenal performance next to DDL.   With all that said, I am positive his Riddler with be üëå",1
In alternate universe Daniel day Lewis is joker.,1
"There Will Be Blood has long been on my list of films I just never got to and still intend to see...  I've seen the ""milk shake"" scene and it actually makes me laugh out loud. Now so does this one, lol. I know I'm seeing it out of context, but I'm like wtf? lmfao",1
My man DDL is just a force of nature. It‚Äôs so impressive that Paul held his own against DDL,1
"Honestly the performances in that film were incredible, and his especially.",1
At 2:20 he sounds like Leto‚Äôs Joker lol,1
It‚Äôs a waste casting DDL as Thomas Wayne.,0
"I watched recently like a month ago and it's by far one of my favorite movies,I watched it like 4 times already,Depsite I watched those important scenes without context but still loved every second of it ,it's legit 10/10 phenomenal film,",1
Well he certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to play Bruce,1
Idk why you're getting downvoted. Can't see DDL signing up for a comic book movie.,1
Indeed. DDL as Ras Al Ghul would be epic or vandal Savage,1
"Oh, I'm sure it is a great film. Just commenting that the two scenes I've ever seen from it are so wonderfully odd out of context.",1
"I doubt we get the entire Justice Society in Black Adam. Maybe just the Key players like Hawkman, Doctor Fate etc.",3
Never thought of Rami Malek as Doctor fate,3
"I didn't include Alan Scott and Jay Garrick because I don't think DC is going to want to confuse things too much, but if they did I'd probably go Dan Stevens as Scott and... someone else as Garrick.",2
Wildcat and Hawkman castings are really good,2
Tom hopper as Atom Smasher is really good lmao,1
so is it set in the present day or the past?,1
Just wanted to know who and where it was confirmed that JSA will be in Black Adam?,1
These are good choices.,1
Rami and Jon Bernthal are excellent choices!,0
Sam Heughan is a much better option for Hawkman and PLZ GET A REDHEAD FOR SHIERA!!!!,0
"It's Hawkman, Dr. Fate, Stargirl and Atom Smasher according to previous leaks.",2
A boy can dream.,2
And his name too...,1
"Yo FR tho, they need someone to match the rock‚Äôs size for Hawkman.   Someone like Jai Courtney size atleast.",2
Thank you! I was torn between Bernthal and Frank Grillo.,1
Oops! Spelled his name wrong...,1
Who do I look like? Jaume Collet-Serra?,0
The Rock said so in this interview : https://screenrant.com/black-adam-movie-jsa-justice-society-dceu/,1
"Nay, they need to pass for Egyptian.",1
Joker: Let me introduce myself.,1
"What about strength in numbers? If it‚Äôs true that the JSA will be in there, then The Rock‚Äôs Black Adam won‚Äôt be fighting just one person. Instead, he will be fighting multiple people.",1
Carter and Shiera aren't Egyptian anymore. They reincarnate. Their souls may be. But not their bodies.,1
I‚Äôd rather they introduce the JSA towards the end of the movie if this is gonna be a period film set wayyyy back in the past.   Like fuck bro how we gon have the JSA and not the fuckin JLA swagga pat down??,1
"This is a movie, not a comic. And Shayera has red hair, not their ancient egyptian counterparts.",1
All of that was retconned in the current hawkman series. Hawkman was actually first from a race of aliens called the deathbringers. He gets reincarnated to redeem what he'd done. I forget what hawkgirls new story is tho,1
I think it‚Äôs gonna be ancient Egypt and also take place later on in the 1950s or something.,1
"Ah so you mean Khufu and Chay-Ara, not Carter and Shiera. That'll be nice. Yeah, they lived with Black Adam back in those days. I thought they were going to showcase their modern reincarnations.",1
">**The Penguin. I know you were mostly  having fun with the casting idea on Twitter, and that you're friendly  with Matt Reeves, however, did you guys ever talk about the role over  bottled water?**   >   >Matt and I had a brief exchange about it,  and the truth is that there was never really any serious attempt to play  the role of The Penguin in *The Batman*. It actually started off  with me posting a picture one day and just having fun trolling the  Internet. This was before any Penguin project was even announced. This  was before Matt Reeves was even attached to do a Batman film. At a  certain point, it just became really fun because of the speculation.  There were talks along the way with DC about it. There were talks along  the way with Matt about it. But, the truth is, I never went in to go  discuss it. I never went on tape for it. Frankly, I think they made a  really cool [choice](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-colin-farrell-talks-play-penguin-1248605).  I cannot wait to see Matt‚Äôs Batman movie, and we happen to be really  good friends because we‚Äôre fathers at the same school. So, for the most  part, it‚Äôs been just a great laugh between the two of us. *(Laughs.)*",3
He gets a kick out of messing with the fans who take all this rumor stuff too seriously. I remember when he was trolling people about playing the Thing.  Mad respect.,3
bullet dodged,3
"Honestly I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt go in this direction, Colin Farrell obviously is a great choice btw",1
Not a fan of this doughboy,0
Wow and Reeves didn‚Äôt cast him? Must have someone much worse in mind,0
Wait wait wait Colin Farrel for penguin is rumored? Haha wtf,1
And many on this sub think it‚Äôs a good casting..,0
Doctor Fate & Hawkman likely aren't gonna be white guys.,3
"Personally the Black Adam Dr. Fate should be portrayed by a non-white actor, I could see Oded Fehr wearing the helm. Kent Nelson Dr. Fate I could see making a return in Shazam 3 and maybe a cameo on the second. For Kent Nelson I could see Timothy Olyphant playing him although I do also want to see him play Jay Garrick.",3
Channing Tatum for the stripper one,3
"I mean, they would all be great",2
Would Rami Malek be too young? He is Egyptian. Although I know Egyptians today aren‚Äôt exactly identical to ancient Egyptians,2
"I wonder if they might go with that young, middle eastern guy from the New 52? I mean, Fate & Hawkman kind of seem like too good of opportunities to diversify the DCEU to pass up",3
HUgo!!,2
Keanu for Doctor Fate. Fassbender as Mister Freeze. Hugo for Braniac. All great actors that can play any role btw,3
Oded Fehr is the only option.,2
Keanu,1
Michael fassbender would be amazing.,1
I think there was a rumor that Pedro Pascal will be Doctor Fate but we‚Äôll see,1
"I mean, Fassbender *has* been in a movie where, in almost all his scenes, he's wearing a helmet...",1
Listen I like Keanu Reeves as a person but the lad can't act. John Wick is so great because he only has to deliver like 6 painstaking lines per movie.,1
"I think Keanu should play every role in the movie that isn't Black Adam, even Teth Adam can be Keanu.",1
Keanu reeves has age!,1
Why is everyone so keen to get Keanu Reeves in a superhero movies. The guy is 55 years old. He is too old to play superhero characters,1
"Younger, older, and ageless? I don‚Äôt know too much about Doctor Fate. Can someone explain?",1
my vote is for pierce brosnan,1
this is probably the least inspired fancast ive ever seen,1
"Hugo Weaving as ageless version, his experience saying Elven stuff is gonna come handy when casting spells, also a fantastic voice that we know can be masked but still convey emotions perfectly.",1
"If they have Dr. Fate in ancient Egypt with the original Black Adam, then he shouldn't be white. The modern day one should be Kent Nelson, but the OG Doc needs to be Egyptian as well",1
I'm pretty sure Keanu is going into the MCU as Kevin Feige has been after him for a while. I say he goes in both because why not. Utilize this man as much as possible,1
"Oded Fehr. He did the voice in the Justice League cartoon, but would be perfect for live action also.",1
Hugo can be vandal savage,1
Keep Keanu Reeves as Constantine.,1
"Outstanding choices.  My top choice would be Cillian Murphy, but these picks here are great!",1
Doubt Hugo would do it.,1
"Keanu supposedly has a role waiting for him in the MCU, and Hugo seems pretty done with comic book movies. Fassbender would be a good snatch since they killed the Fox mutant films except maybe Deadpool.",0
"Yeah, I mean doctor fate could be I guess, say the avatar is just from a different country, but hawkman is likely katar, meaning it would be odd asf if he was a white guy.",3
"If they're Khufu and Nabu, I hope not.",2
"hope so, but Hollywood has a huge streak of whitewashing movies in these types of settings (like Prince of Persia or Scorpion King)",2
Then Oded Fehr and Marwan Kenzari.,0
"Why Oded Fehr ? He's not good looking, famous & Egyptian.Israelis & Indians have already played enough Middle Eastern characters.Stop interchanging brown people.",0
Yeah. Those three actors could play just about anything. Hugo Weaving in particular could probably literally play any part and be beyond excellent. I want to see him do something like Logan Lucky where he can REALLY show off.,2
"I would like see him as Dr Fate in the Black Adam film, then maybe someone else for Kent Nelson? Depends on hwo they want to do it",1
a lot of the DCEU has taken huge inspiration from New 52.,2
Ooo Hugo for Brainiac is such a good choice,2
Didn't Patty confirm he's Maxwell Lord?,1
*laughs in Samuel L Jackson*,3
Hasn't stopped him from kicking ass as John Wick.,2
"TIL theres an age limit on being a ""superhero character""",2
Someone should‚Äôve told Sam Jackson to turn down Nick Fury 10 years ago.,1
Why? I know when he did Red Skull he notoriously loathed it because of the hours of makeup but Dr. Fate just wears a helmet,1
You mean Khufu? Katar is an alien so he could be white.,3
Thankfully that‚Äôs been changing these past few years.,1
Yes and yes.,1
"He voiced him on Justice League, so maybe that‚Äôs the basis?",0
Oh you‚Äôre right. Disregard my initial comment. Thx for the info,1
The makeup was just part of it. He‚Äôs stated that he think he‚Äôs done with that type of film.,1
Ahh yes. I was going through hawkman names in my head and katar sounded the most egyptian,3
These chicks are down right *yoked* my god,3
Cmon bezos give us the money to finish it,3
"Remember when some random blogger on twitter tried to say Zack is sexist, and the Amazons clapped back haaaard. The news outlets never covered the response from the actual actresses. Not to mention Zack's costume designer Michael Wilkinson is gay so he wasn't trying to design these costumes for the 'male-gaze' like the blogger was saying. Here's what the actresses said in response to the Amazonian costume criticism: [https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbip\_CMno49/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbip_CMno49/?hl=en)",3
The Amazons in Justice League look a bit different from the Amazons in Wonder Woman.,2
U wanna get in between dem thighs don‚Äôt chu? ü§îü§•üò≥,2
Bezos doesn‚Äôt give,2
"Zack Snyder being a male-gaze sexist is not something I‚Äôd ever think of. Hell, based on his portrayal of Wonder Woman versus the JL one, that gave his views on women away entirely.",3
Yeah. They‚Äôre all in bikinis.,0
death by snu snu,1
He does when the divorce papers require it.,3
"Critics always hated him, not only saying that his vision sucks but calling him a bad person. Some quotes from Sucker Punch reviews:  Manages to be ugly, stupid, offensive, depressing, sexist and boring in equal measures.  Imaginary girl posse empowerment, or male fantasy sexualized violence? Entailing female fighter fashion statement armor comprising stilettos, fishnet, overflowing bosomy bustiers and big hair.  A creatively bankrupt succession of fetishy bromides -- steampunk, Asimov, medieval times, and (personal fave!) a woman in a sailor suit, sucking on a lollipop and calling it feminism 'cause she carries a gun, too.  It seems to have been made for 15-year-old boys by a sad middle-aged man whose only experience of life is from violent comics, shoot-'em-up video games and online pornography.  Proves that while masturbating over your cast may not make you blind, it can impair directorial vision  The hypocrisy of Sucker Punch is that it portends to supplant traditional objectified-female eroticism with violence, but all it does is turn said violence into another form of fetishized display for its largely male audience  ..this tricked up female empowerment tale undercuts itself with its fetishized slutty schoolgirls and its repetitious steampunk anime aesthetic.  That's one of the reasons I don't care about RT scores.",3
U like? üí™üèøüî•,1
"Jesus, Zack must've ran over his dog multiple times or something...",1
Harley and Diana being the new poster people for the franchise is great,2
The booth babes cosplay look great,1
I love how even though this event is for the **BoP** movie they're still dressed as Squad!Harley.,1
I want all them,3
I prefer the versions on the left,2
The movie would have to be way better than it looks for me to buy any of these.,1
There was a time not long ago on the sub where you couldn't say anything supporting Zack without being mobbed by haters and deniers... they all gone quite now,3
You forgot to add Jason Momoa as an advocate of the Snyder Cut. Good article none the less!,3
"This is pretty great, only thing is you forgot to mention the history lesson with Darkseid and other things like Atom and Martian Manhunter. But other than that this is great for people unaware.",2
There‚Äôs still a couple of annoying ones sadly. I think more people have just grown to allow people to enjoy what they enjoy.,3
Oh snap. I talked about him in the article but didn‚Äôt add him to the list. Thank you!,2
Thank you. The more I looked into it the more I realized was cut. I didn‚Äôt want to inundate people with details but I hope still expressed the magnitude of the changes nonetheless.,2
I just think a lot of people don't look at this from an unbiased lens. I can't take those people seriously. Also people who shit on whedon. Refuse to take them seriously either,1
Check out this [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wSYk5y1qpnvU2hsJroGQERO8PwjKKDF703EqQlxAYvA/) for more celebrity endorsements of the RTSC campaign.,1
"The only other thing I think you could say is that Zack says Cyborg was meant to be the heart of the film, which compared to his performance in JL‚Äôs theatrical cut can add to the magnitude of what was changed. But I get that this is more of an overview.",2
What an absolute legend. Thank you so much!,1
That‚Äôs true. I‚Äôll add that in for good measure. Thank you!,2
"I feel bad for all of them. They came into this franchise full of hope and enthusiasm. I remember seeing bts photos during the shoot on Jason's and Gal's instagram, they had a blast. Fast forward a year later, most of their enthusiasm are gone. You can see it in their face. They laid so low to dodge flak and hardly even talk about the films outside of press junket anymore. They've been addressing rumors almost entirely by themselves (with other assistance outside of WB). They deserve much more than how WB is treating them. Especially Ray, Ezra, and Henry. I hope we get to see all of their faces on one screen again.",3
Jason's face says it all.,3
"""*I'll be safe if I stay hidden*"" lmao",3
"Ray is like ""Please look at me and tell me I'm not a bad person for doing this"". Everyone looked away. Poor guy was probably told his career is on the line",3
"That other interview with Jason, Ray and Affleck is also kind of similar.  Just when Ray mentioned Zack's name, Ben lowered his head and Jason looked away.  They didnt wanna lie in front of the camera. :/",3
I mean that is how it works. Imagine if any of them said during JL promotion that the film was bad and nothing like what it originally was and all the reshoots sucked. Good luck keeping the role or even getting hired by other studios for anything,3
ahahahaha,2
All I can see is so much pain in their face/eyes üò≠üíî,3
"Jason sitting over here like:   ""Yeah, that's wrong, that's false, why are you lying Ray?""",2
I love Jason's expression during all this,1
"Of all the people, I really feel the worst for Ray. He probably thought JL was gonna be his big star-making role since he was an unknown actor prior to this, and things just didn't work out for the poor guy. Aside from True Detective, has he booked any work since then?",1
"The problem here was that they didn't take the time to not only introduce but also make us love  these incarnations of these characters.  The first Avengers film worked so well because every one of those heroes had been properly introduced in at least one solo film(two in the case of Iron Man) or as a supporting character in another film.  By the time they got to the group team-up fan anticipation was high.  Justice League felt rushed, like they were trying to play catch up with the MCU.",1
That's an apples and oranges comparison.  The Tolkien books are a breed apart from superhero comics.  I'm also not saying that every superhero universe needs to follow the MCU model although you can't argue with their success.,1
[and then there‚Äôs Ray now](https://twitter.com/rehsifyar/status/1197887135606616064?s=21),1
After all they are not that good in this audition...      Can't blame them,2
Henry & Ben nearly made me piss myself lol   ...   *cries himself to sleep and dreams about SC*,1
"Neither Zack or Joss should've been in charge of Justice League. I feel like they just don't get DC at all. Zack tried making it super dark and gloomy and failed, Joss tried turning it into Avengers 2.0 and failed too.",0
"I‚Äôm the OP of this, credit?",0
"I feel sad for Ray.  He's a cool guy and had great excitement from day 1 in DCEU.  It was sweet WHEN he wore ""I<3ZS"" tshirt..  But it was much later we knew WHY he wore that.  :/",3
">Especially Ray, Ezra, and Henry.  I dont know how Ezra has been treated badly by WB. If they wanted, they couldve recasted him and get the lighter version of the film that the director duo were gonna do. Instead they kept him as the character and still looking for a compatible director. And hes an important part in WB other biggest franchise: the wizarding world. WB seems to treat him with alot of preference",2
"Sad part is the JL movies could have been just as good as the Marvel stuff if WB didnt fuck up the whole movie, even the cast know the movies sucks dick. That's why Affleck and Cavill left.   Hopefully if the Snyder Cut ever releases, WB gets their shit together and uses the Snyder Cut storyline as the main story, and do a part 2 as it was intended.   Pattinson can do the movies where batman just began, and affleck can be the older batman.",2
">I remember seeing bts photos during the shoot on Jason's and Gal's instagram, they had a blast. Fast forward a year later, most of their enthusiasm are gone.   Those two are probably in the best position though simply because both have the next films set due to the success of the first one. The rest are just gone. Either in limbo or officially.",1
"""What sucks about our business is you can't speak your mind at times..."" - Jason Momoa, Aquaman press tour",3

That's why Batfleck is best boi/batman lol,1
link please,1
"During JL ww released date, Joss was promoting Thor Ragnarok.and prises how good is this movie.",0
Ben knee what happened,1
Back to the same old agreement of not every movie has to mirror the marvel movies. Lord of the rings and hobbit movies didn‚Äôt have 10 movies before then for each character. They wanted to tell a story with those characters,3
I mean there‚Äôs still tons of issues with the DCEU‚Äôs approach,1
Joss was only brought because WB had to clean up Zack's mess. They lost faith in him after giving him many chances and frankly they are right.  Stupid ass Snyder and his edgelording got this franchise toppled down.,0
"And he still tags almost everything with #borglife. Warner couldn't ask for a more enthusiastic actor and ambassador for the franchise, and they're just...doing nothing with him.",3
"I think no one realizes that Ezra is the only one who got away from this mess with some success.  - He didn't have to deal with socia media rants as he dont have one. - Didnt have to talk about Snydet Cut like Jason Momoa did. - Already is starring in WB's Fantastic Beasts franchise. - Even though directors attached to Flash Movie left due to creative differences, Ezra decided to pitch a new plot to WB and now IT's director is on board and the movie is ready to roll soon.",2
">That's why Affleck and Cavill left  Then why is Cavill constantly taking about how he wants to come back to the role of superman and how he has more to give for the character? How come he didn't tweet the RTSC hashtag? Henry wants in, he didnt leave. WB just either doesnt want a superman movie, or wants their next one without Cavill.",3
">Pattinson can do the movies where batman just began, and affleck can be the older batman.  I think by now that rumor has been killed.",2
"They should have gone forward with the initial release slate which ended with Cyborg and GL in 2020. Ben Affleck would do his Batman film, bow out of DCEU after batman's death in JL2 and WB could have rebooted Batman with Matt Reeve's new trilogy after 2021 with Pattinson.   The positive side of this direction change in DC brought us BoP and SS2.",2
" >Hopefully if the Snyder Cut ever releases  There is absolutely no chance it doesn't come out, now that Affleck and Gadot are tweeting about it. That absolutely came as a result of WB telling them they were allowed to (whether directly or thru Zack).   Don't know how or when it will come out (still praying on it coming to theaters in that empty April 2020 slot, however ridiculously unlikely that is!) but it absolutely will now.  I'd also really like Zack to come back just to tie things off. If Affleck came back to complete his arc and have his Batman die or be Lazarus Pitted into being Pattinson, then WB would have fixed the whole thing for me.  Affleck coming back is obviously also ridiculously unlikely, but he clearly liked Zack's arc, which is what he signed up for. All of his misery on that press tour and his withdrawal from the role was all when Zack had been pushed out and everything was being rewritten to that mess we got. A lot of people would have stepped away at that point. It's fucking depressing to think a boardroom could ruin a movie like that, particularly if you respect those you signed on for who's vision is being dismantled.",1
Releasing a Snyder cut will only remind people of that trainwreck and jeopardize the good graces they are enjoying now. They are clearly moving on.,1
That‚Äôs just sad,2
Why was he promoting Ragnarok? He didn't work on that movie.,2
"Exactly. That argument is one of the laziest I‚Äôve seen, especially given the history these characters ALREADY have. If you can‚Äôt hop in and infer things on your own while a story goes somewhere new, that‚Äôs on you, not the film.",2
I'm curious. Can you elaborate on what you think those issues are?,0
"Even though I liked MOS quite a bit, I‚Äôm happy they went with the soft reboot, it‚Äôs so much more fun (Aquaman) and creative (The Batman) now. And along with WW they‚Äôve been smash hits so far, Shazam got good reviews as well.",0
"well said. wb needs to wake the hell up and start fast tracking, setting up committees, whatever.",1
"Thank you, Exactly what I'm trying to say. Extra came of very well compared to many of the others.",1
As it should be. We don't want the new path they're taking tainted by bad memories of the past. Fresh start after Snyder is working really great for them.,1
"It seems like even WB doesnt know what to do, since Pattinsons batman isn't in the main JL universe, and he isn't in the Joker stand alone movie universe so who even knows at this point",0
We could've got Sirens instead of BoP if Ayer remained in DC.,1
"wow, the lazarus pit never occurred to me. could have been a cool in-movie way to deage bruce",1
Yep. Momoa and Ray tweeting on Sunday nov 17th wouldn't have changed anything. We were expecting that bcz both were vocal supporters of SC. ( I believe Momoa and Ray personally handle their IG/Twitter )  But tweets from Gal and Affleck changed everything. No one was expecting that. And both of them might have PR teams who were advised by them to go put out this tweet.   Something's happening man.. :),2
"How was Snyder the problem? Look at the first Justice League trailer, look at what he planned with the second Justice League movie and everything, it would have been so amazing.   Instead we got Whedon being ordered by some higher ups to change 80 PAGES of the movie, where roughly 1 page equals to 1 minute.   The movie was supposed to be like 3 hours long and WB forced them to shorten it to under 2 hours.  Just imagine if you removed an entire HOUR of footage from Avengers Endgame, the movie would suck absolute dick",2
I mean BVS did have a lot to do with how JL went,1
Directors do that a ton tho,1
Joss Whedon https://twitter.com/joss/status/923795350174887936?s=20,0
"Strange, isnt it? ....",0
If you'd like we can discuss it over pm (Just feel a one on one discussion works better),1
The way Cavill spoke about superman's future in DCEU recently in an interview is kind of similar to what Ezra has been saying about his flash movie.   He wants to please the fans and understands very well that it is the first live action movie.  He genuinely wants to perfect it and that maybe the reason why he himself pitched the plot for film.,1
">It seems like even WB doesnt know what to do, since Pattinsons batman isn't in the main JL universe,  And that's sort of irrelevant since we're probably not gonna see a JL follow-up any time in the foreseeable future. That is presumably why they agreed to give Reeves the full creative control he asked for.",1
"The Snyder problem started long before JL. He is a divisive filmmaker that couldn't connect with audiences. He's a visual person, not a storyteller.   They went from MoS to him fighting Batman, to everyone fighting a resurrected superman. They rushed it to compete with Marvel. No amount of footage can fix that.   In came JL. Already in trouble with production and rewrites. That is again on Snyder cause he lead production. So what makes you think JL will turn out differently?   And a 3 hour movie? That's just throwing pasta on the wall and see what sticks. No clear plan.   Whedon was a paid replacement of Snyder both due to the bad reception of BvS and as he deal with his personal life. He was hired to fix an already bloated film and he failed.",1
"Yeah. All he did was say Ragnarok is awesome. It's not like he left Marvel on bad terms to go work with DC & this came out of left field. Wasn't James Gunn Tweeting about how great Infinity War & Endgame were *after* he got fired? Directors praise movies they like. Whedon wasn't ""promoting"" Ragnarok. He was saying his friends made a great movie.",1
"That's not really ""promoting."" That's just one director from the MCU saying he likes another movie from the MCU.",2
"Yeah i know, but Wonder woman, Superman, Flash, Shazam, Aquaman are all in that universe? Unless they decide to do some flashpoint shit and just replace batman",1
"I always wonder what's wrong with telling a clear self-contained story. Why should we have whole Superman trilogy before something interesting starts to happen? Snyder had 5 films clearly planned out that were tied together with Superman's arc. Why we need solo trilogies for each character before they form Justice League and face a big villain? People are so closed minded that they only see Marvel's way as recipe for success. Snyder didn't want to do anything like Marvel does, that's why he had planned self-contained story and then very likely be done with it while other filmmakers  would do whatever they want.  It's like complaining about LotR trilogy not exploring every character in spin-off films. (Oh and they killed Gandalf in the first book, only for him to return in second. Hmmm.)",1
I'd also note a ton of Marvel Directors congratulated WW for it's success,1
"Same situation. Like I said, we're probably not gonna see those characters meet up again anytime soon. If they eventually do they can just X-Men it and ignore/broad strokes the earlier movies. But I don't think the continuity is gonna be a major concern going forward. Hence the ""Pattinson can be young Batman in flashbacks while Ben can still play the REAL Batman!"" stuff probably not happening. Pattinson *is* Batman now.",1
"But its not self contained. They are 3 connected films that are rushed.  Joker is self contained. Aquaman lives in his own world. BvS and JL are not self-contained.  The truth is, they were constantly pivoting throughout the production of the 3 Snyder films, and that is the result. We were supposed to get a Flash movie almost the same time as MoS was being developed. But they put all their cards on Snyder. One person cannot do it.  Lets not forget, they only realize the potential when Marvel's universe started to come together, so they rushed it.  I myself wonder why some people are clamoring for a JL recut and none for the MoS sequel. That's what we are supposed to be bugging WB with.  What is this exactly trying to accomplish? They are on the right path now FINALLY. So they want to go back? When what was originally intended isn't even on their current schedule? I don't get it.",1
Very true. & DC was (at least publicly) very happy for Marvel when Endgame broke the box office record. It's a bunch of people in the same industry appreciating each other's work.,1
"""You think you can waltz in here, get the Wizard's blessing and take my place? Is that what you think, Batson?""  ""You wanna know what I think, alright, I thi-""  ""IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK!""",2
There better be some wrestling moves in this movie,1
Pretty horrifying really. üò¨,1
"Awesome, different body and longer ears and you have Cham from Legion of Superheroes.",1
I can hear elder scrolls chanting in the background,1
Do we know what time period black Adam will take place in?,1
Why the background of the Mona Lisa though?,1
The people‚Äôs anti hero,1
Lmaoooooo  Yo imagine this dude saying that shit looking exactly like that....   Fuckin love dark comedy.,1
"nah nothing is confirmed yet, but I'm assuming ancient Egypt",1
Ok. I wonder how the JSA will tie in to all of that,1
I always knew The Rock would be instrumental in our efforts to defeat Isis,3
"I‚Äôm thinking that if the movie is set during Black Adam‚Äôs time, then Doctor Fate will have Nabu under the helm. Which is a great setup for a future Doctor Fate movie.",3
DOCTOR FATE HERE WE FUCKING GO. RELEASE THE HYPE ENGINE!,3
A live action Dr Fate is very exciting. Dr Fate is one of the best designed superheroes imo,3
Doctor Fate and maybe Hawkman? üò±,3
"Until the bigger trades confirm this, grain of salt.",3
Im loving everything about this movie so far,3
Fucking next level. Also interesting is they've chosen two legacy JSA characters with ties to ancient Egypt now. I'm guessing that'll come into play.,3
Is Heroic Hollywood reliable..?,3
Wow that's fucking awesome.,3
Hells yeeeeeah. The DCEU needs moar magic.,3
"Doctor Fate, huh?  Now I‚Äôm definitely watching this.",3
"OH MY FUCKING GOD!!!! This does it, Black Adam is one my most anticipated movies of the decade! I love Doctor Fate and I hope he opens the doors for Zatanna üòç",3
"Isis.....what are the odds they change her name?  /s somewhat sarcastic  Doctor Fate will be cool. Would kinda like the origins of the Blue Beetle Scarab like the Rebirth version, I like the idea that it was used in ancient times and Fate sealed the original Beetle away in the Scarab",3
This is actually insane. I‚Äôm really pumped for this movie. I can‚Äôt wait for the Shazam franchise to really go deep into the magical realm of DC,2
Sofia Boutella as Isis,3
Synopsis: Imagine the Rock with magical powers and the ability to fly returning to the role that made him famous: being a heel but... hear me out... he fights an extremist terrorist militia that formed after the dissolvement of al-qaeda.   Studio Exec: I‚Äôm sold.,2
"Is this even a credible source? How come THR, Variety or Deadline haven‚Äôt reported on it?",2
I want my stripper Doctor Fate lmao,2
Hugh Laurie as Doctor Fate? That‚Äôd be a good casting imo.,2
This is so exciting this movie is shaping up to be an event.,1
whaaaaaaaaaaa?!,1
My hopes for this movie is and I love The Rock and what he's accomplished so far but hopefully Black Adam isn't just Dwayne. I want Adam to establish himself. I want to see the character and his traits come to life. I'm still skeptical for this movie but if Doctor Fate is appearing in this then my hype will go up a little more.,1
"This movie just keeps getting better and better. Justice League may have failed miserably, but with Black Adam, Hawkman, AND Doctor Fate in the same movie, Justice Society may actually happen! He‚Äôll throw in The Spectre as a cameo for the added fluff! :)",1
"For what it's worth, Zari has seemingly been written out of Arrowverse after Legends of Tomorrow's fourth season, and we know WB sometimes does that to TV characters who will appear in movies, like killing off Deadshot and Amanda Waller for Suicide Squad.",1
"SHUT IT THE FUCK DOWN THEY SAID DR FUCKING FATE  IM ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN, WE CANNOT BE STOPPED",1
Yes my boy Dr Fate.  This is basically confirmation now that the film will be set in ancient Egypt with Dr Fate Hawkman and probably Hawkgirl all appearing.,1
Dr. Fate is literally one of my favorites,1
I‚Äôm here for the ISIS jokes,2
Any chance Tom Cruise takes up the Dr.Fate mantle?,2
Oh my god doctor fucking fate. I never thought I'd see the day.,1
Holy hell. I cannot wait to see Doctor Fate in this.,1
Ok...this is getting my attention.,1
Oh cool! Will they call her ISIS though? They didn't on LoT.,1
omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg,1
FUCK  my hype level just exploded,1
"Hmmm Heroic Hollywood isnt the most accurate when it comes to scoops, so I will take this with a big grain of salt.   If true however......hell fucking yes. Cannot wait to see Dr Fate on the big screen.",1
According to... whom?,1
"I thought these guys were super unreliable. I hope this is true, but not gonna be too excited until more sites cover it.",1
"Oh, man. Doctor Fate being in this really made Black Adam go from a film that I'm really looking forward to in 2021 to one of my most anticipated films in 2021, I think. I'm really liking where they're going with the Shazam/Black Adam corner of the DCEU so far.",1
Love me some Doctor Fate!,1
How many times can I upvote this??? FINALLY Dr. Fate!!!,1
"The movie may jump through time as the star staff, helm of nabu, and hawkman are relics of the past and can exist in multiple periods. Maybe the society defeats him in ancient times  and reforms as the JSA by the time he awakens.",1
"This is absolutely awesome but there‚Äôs still a thing  I quite don‚Äôt get:  Okay, bring in the Justice Society of America, love that. But if Black Adam is in the same universe as Shazam, and Shazam is in the same world as MoS and BvS, and if the events of JL are in the same world as MoS and BvS, how exactly are they gonna explain this group of superpowered people that possibly existed even before Wonder Woman battled in WW1?   Are they gonna be undercover? From the future..?",1
Dwayne Johnson is gonna singlehandedly win the war on terror. Hype,1
Have to wonder what the chances if this website getting this information before a big trade are.   Is this a reliable source with a proven track record or it's just something people want to hear so believe it?,1
"LETS GOOOO!!! I DON""T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DOCTOR FATE BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEM OF HIM HE LOOKS PRETTY AWESOME! HYPE",1
Doctor Fate fans we eatin‚Äô now!!!,1
Officially HYPED,1
Been dying to see Doctor Fate on the big screen! Hopefully it leads to his own solo movie,1
I just finished 52 and loved his arc in that. I hope at some point they pull from that.,1
Doctor Fate LET'S GO,1
We need a R-rated Spectre movie,1
It makes a lot of sense.  Nabu the god inside of Dr Fate is an Egyptian Lord of Order. So it fits with Black Adam's background.  Either way I am incredibly hype.,1
YESSSSSS!!,1
"I don‚Äôt read the comics. Are we talking Isis Isis, or is Isis some evil super villain?",1
This movie just keeps getting better and better,1
Fate!!!!,1
"no it won't. umberto is the worst ""reporter"" ever. you can't trust anything coming from heroic hollywood.",1
FUCK. YES. LOVE ME SOME DOCTOR FATE!,1
So much meme possibility,1
"God, I love all of this...I just want someone in charge of it besides the people who‚Äôve been in charge of the DCEU for the past decade. What are the JLU and Young Justice writers doing these days?",1
"Good. Take back the name Isis. It was never a properly translated acronym for the terrorist group anyway,",1
Please give us a glimpse of Vandal Savage too.,1
I'm positive studios plant these rumors ahead of time to see what the response is before moving forward with anything. I'll believe it when I get confirmation from WB.,1
"Told you guys dr fate will happen, but he‚Äôll be dancing in his tighty whiteys in his apartment.",1
Holy shit now this is some noteworthy news,1
I thought they were doing hawk man?? He‚Äôs my favorite :D,1
Never thought I‚Äôd see Doctor Fate in Live action! Incredible can‚Äôt wait for this movie!,1
"I didnt care for rocks black adam but if it gonna have doctor fate, <thats something else.",1
Yay! Dr. Fate love,1
YESSSS,1
Finally doctor fate gets more attention. I feel like dc forgot about him at all. Its such an underestimated character with so much potential,1
Holy fuck! Dr. Fate!,1
I thought we defeated Isis?,1
"Source Umberto Dumbuldorf Gonzales, yes, his track record is great !!",1
Didnt they have Isis in legends of tomorrow but had to change her name?,1
Sounds awesome,1
"HELL YEAH!  Dr fate is one of my favorite dc characters, and I can‚Äôt wait to see him on the big screen!",1
I bet you that Isis will be renamed to Aset for the movie.,1
Pls get Liam Nesson as Dr Fate,1
Oh fuck yes.,1
I'm so down for a film about all of the ancient Egyptian DC characters,1
"I know this is basically just a baseless rumor, but it's so refreshing for baseless rumors about DC films being about character appearances as opposed to how ""doomed"" the movie is.",1
Yes Yes Yes. Dr. Fate is one of my favorite characters of all time.,1
Isis? Ike,1
WHO'S PLAYING DOCTOR FATE?,1
Hawk man too? That‚Äôs going to be wild,1
Doctor Fate?? /Homer Simpson salivating noises/,1
"*Yessss, brother. The hype rises!*",1
ok this is getting big. I feel like they should rename ISIS though,1
"last time Joker cinematographers,  now this. this movie gonna be awesome.  i wish zack snyder also join with them as a executive producer.",1
With Marvel dying down it‚Äôs time for DC to shine. As the great Heath Ledger Joker once said . . ‚ÄúAnd Here we go!‚Äù,0
Don't do that....dont give me hope. Dr fate *weeps openly*,0
Is this the same ‚ÄúAdam‚Äù from High Priestess in GOG V2?,0
Can't wait for Dwayne Johnson to destroy in Allah's name,0
I would rather take my dceased korean (meaning she doesn‚Äôt know comic books) 97 year old grandma over heroic Hollywood any day.,0
Suddenly I'm slightly interested in this film.,0
"Doctor Fate is one of the coolest in the DC arsenal. Has been for decades.   But I don't have a lot of confidence in translating to the screen. Previous DC attempts have been weak. Too many accountants.  Need some Magick.   So many brilliant writers, cinematographers and directors. TOO many middlemen looking to appease the current social fad.  TLDR: DC comics -> Film = SHIT",0
Is it that fucking hard to do a Superman/Shazam vs. Black Adam live action movie??,0
Dr. Fate will be a woman. Hawkman will be a black guy.  Calling it now,0
He's gonna help Linda turn Isis into Waswas.,3
"I mean, he was the first non-government official to know that we killed bin Laden.",3
Someone please give this man some silver or gold. I would but I'm poor.,3
Here‚Äôs hoping it‚Äôs prenounced (Ee-Sees),2
They don‚Äôt call him the Rock for nothing,1
"Donald Trump will laud The Rock, until he realizes Dwayne isn't white üòú",0
Can't wait to see Doctor Fate.,3
I hope so man. I love Doctor Fate,3
"I was already in for this movie, but my hype just increased by at least 1,000%.",3
Dr Fate is also a great tool for correcting any issues with the multiverse,1
I hope they pull it off well Fate‚Äôs outfit can be outright badass at times,3
"That was my reaction too, was never a huge fan but he has tooons of great stories he's part of and the possibilities with him are infinite.. Great choice",3
"This was the exact phrase I thought, Wayne let‚Äôs ducking goooo",3
"lol, goddammit, I read right by that and did a Looney Toons double-take, ""A-WHAAAAAA...."" DOCTOR FATE LETS FUCKING GO BOYS",2
VROOM!! VROOM!! MUTHAFUCKAS!!,2
"I was hoping he‚Äôd pop up at the end of Suicide Squad, give a speech about how Enchantress is upsetting the balance, wave his hands and deal with her to end the conflict.",1
My body is ready!!!,1
I wonder if they‚Äôll add a CGI touch up to the helmet since on its own it‚Äôll look a little off like Iron Mans helmet.,1
WE ARE NOW SLAVED TO THE HYPE ENGINE.,1
They‚Äôve been wanting Tom Cruise for years for this role.,3
"Despite what people's opinions about Smallville are, I loved the Absolute Justice episodes with Fate, Hawkman and others, especially Fate.",2
Hawkman is supposedly the main supporting character,3
Bring on Carter Hall!,3
Hawkman and the JSA.,3
I mean weren‚Äôt the Hawkman rumors started like this as well and now everyone on this sub seems to be running with it.,3
"Yeah, Heroic Hollywood is almost nothing but clickbait rumors. They‚Äôll report on stuff that‚Äôs true but after the fact, and then they‚Äôll run with wild speculation the other 75% of the time.",2
"I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôll see the original versions, i.e. Nabu and Prince Khufu, not Kent Nelson and Carter Hall.",3
Who knows but these characters have been rumored for awhile now,1
"I mean, they did change it for Legends of Tomorrow, so I'd say chances are decent. If they're going with the actual ancient Egyptian route, it gets a but easier to keep.",1
Adamette,1
"Isis as in the DC comics character, not the terrorist organization. I'm pretty sure she was linked to SHAZAM! (not the movie) back in the day.",2
They don‚Äôt report who‚Äôs in the movie until a casting takes place.,1
Tbh Zari has so little connection to the character I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd make a difference,1
Stupid jokers.,1
Don't want this. Will be same as Will Smith as Deadshot. Too busy for the role,2
No way. I'd actually be shocked if they did.,1
When I heard the JSA will be in it. Thats what got me super excited. Now I'm even more excited with Dr Fate. I hope this all leads to a Justice League Dark movie.,1
"I mean, we‚Äôd all watch that.",1
"I mean it could just be low profile events, and government cover ups. In the current DCEU it's implied that Gotham has been full on batshit for at least 20 years. Theoretically, MoS was just the first global level threat to bring attention to it.  In SS, Waller even says that maybe Superman was a beacon for them to come crawling out of the darkness.",3
"Yeah, when the JSA rumors first appeared, I wondered the same thing. The JSA are a public team, that is not hidden from society. The DCEU kind of established that superheros and metahumans were a new phenomenon, much like the New 52 comics continuity did. Batman was was an exception.  Regardless, I'm excited for the JSA appearing in the film. I was never a huge fan of New 52 inspired decision to make metas and superheros a new occurance.",1
"Remember what Erik Selvig said in Thor  >He‚Äôs delusional. Listen to what he‚Äôs saying. He‚Äôs talking about Mjolnir, and Thor and Bifrost! It‚Äôs the stories I grew up with as a child.  As far as the people in the present day are concerned, it was all just mythology.",1
It's likely gonna be in ancient egypt.,1
The same way Wonder Woman 1984 is gonna have Diana fighting in public back in the 1980s based on what we know. They're not gonna be overly beholden to the continuity of the older films going forward.,2
"In Shazam they never said that the modern JL members are the first superheroes ever existed. So maybe the old JSA members are not as popular as Superman and Batman any more. Especially amongst kids.  As far as the MoS, BVS and JL, this confirms, if true,  what everybody say about the continuity. That they are just gonna ignore these events moving forward.",1
"I wouldn't try to think about the continuity that much, think of the DC films more akin to FoX-Men than MCU.",1
I hope they separate this from dceu. Leave dceu as it‚Äôs own contained story. Transformers got so retarded when they kept adding things like that and it just made no sense,0
"Do you really think that WB is interested in anything related to MOS, BvS or even JL? this point of the game, continuity will give a damn, except Black Adam and Shazam himself there are no plans to make crossovers with other superheroes, if there were still references in Aquaman and Shazam to the DCEU it was because it was too late to make changes, there are rumors (and I emphasize, rumors for those who want to correct me) that WW84 is a movie that not only moves tonally away from BvS but also from the first part (who has read the spoilers in DCEUleaks confirmed by ViewerAnon himself, will know that I mean) and let's not even talk about The Suicide Squad by James Gunn, so expect many contradictions with the other movies from now on, at the end of the day, the only ones who care about continuity are the people involved in this more not the casual public that ended up repudiating BvS and SS and didn't even stop by the cinemas to see JL.",0
Doctor Strange was created in 1963 and Doctor Fate in 1940 so kind of the other way around.,1
Character,1
Considering WW had Greek gods I would expect her as thr egyptian God. Depending on his back story he has a connection with ancient egypt.,1
Egyptian goddess,1
From the current rumors ut looks like the JSA(which includes hawkman) and dr fate,1
I mean that would work. You avoid controversy and still give an accurate name to the character. Considering this will most likely be set in Egypt naming her Aset is more true to the Egyptian pronunciation,1
"Right?! I'd rather hear optimistic ""So and so cool character may appear in upcoming film"" rather than ""Is this film dead upon arrival?""",1
I read that in Bale's Batman voice.,0
"*MCU creates the highest grossing movie of all time*  ""With Marvel dying...""",2
"Are you being sarcastic? If not, no, this is black Adam, a DC comics character",1
Doctor Fate > Doctor Strange,0
They're leading up to it for Shazam 3,1
"There have been multiple female Doctor Fates and Hawkman has reincarnated multiple times and the original Earth version was from Ancient Egypt, so if you're trying to make some point about PC Hollywood, you've picked a bad example.",3
I mean there were rumours of Hawkman being cast as a middle eastern guy which makes sense if this is set in ancient Africa/Near East,1
Well if they are going with Egyptian hawk man I would think It wouldnt be whitey mcwhite face. Just a guess tho.,2
"Have an angry upvote for this, you punster.",3
This is my favorite meme honest to god hahaha,1
Does that still perplex anyone else? Like I get that The Rock is The Rock and everything but STILL.,3
"Yo what if this movie took on the agenda of Terrorism and twist it into the story of Black Adam?   Like Adam fights someone who thinks of himself like an OG like Bin laden and commits atrocities in the movie, and black Adam turns heel and decides to overthrow him while tricking to work with him the whole time... and then  Doctor Fate and Hawkman get in the middle off all this mess tries to play the heroes  And then there‚Äôs also a love story going on between Adam Isis    ...Fuck it‚Äôs Scorpion King all over again...if you think about it. From any angle. No wonder they casted him lol.   Even if he can‚Äôt pull off the Black Adam character study wise, he can pull off the story action wise due to his charisma.   I can‚Äôt wait either way.",3
For real?,2
Is this confirmed?,1
Gotchu,3
üòúüòúüòúüòúüòú Drumpf destroyed üòúüòúüòúüòúüòú,0
"Zatanna and JLD not too far behind hopefully.   Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman have really popularized the magic genre and showcased what's possible.",3
I wonder who they'd get to play him? Doctor Fate is one of the coolest DC characters imo.,3
[New 52](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/3/37/Earth_2_Vol_1_11_Textless.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130403162817) costume design for Fate was amazing.,3
"Not a comics reader, but ive seen Doctor Fate only in Young Justice. I absolutely love his outfit, his magic, the music that plays when he arrives, and his storyline. He is not a big part of the show, but one of the coolest imo.",3
I can see Keanu doing it,3
"Oh god, why?",1
Tom Cruise would probably be the worst choice for that role knowing that Tom doesn't want his face to be covered for most of a film.,1
"Let‚Äôs see this. He kills Hawkman in the final battle and then there‚Äôs a jump to the present time and we see the Hawkman in civilian clothes walk by as Black Adam notices him. That or I‚Äôve always thought a Hawkman movie that jumps through time could be cool, Black Adam would also be there and there could be multiple clashes in different time periods.",3
I will bet you anything that Hawkman vs Black Adam is the climax fight of this film.  Adam will kill Hawkman cementing him as a villain. The wizard will see this and realize that Adam is beyond redemption and then  banish him to the end of the universe.  Hawkman will reincarnate in a later film and Adam will finally make it back to earth in Shazam 3.,2
Just don't mess them up like Legends,1
"That was barely Isis at all, it was just some random person with no ties to the character. She was basically an original character, tbh she was part of why I dropped Legends; it seemed like her only role was to snarkily shit on the rest of the group  I‚Äôm not saying they had to stick to the comic-book counterpart, cos no one was bothered. But to me she was basically a brand new character",0
"Yeah, I know. It was a joke about how the studio exec wouldn‚Äôt know that.",2
Also would want their faces shown more than like  70% of the time.,1
I hope they do.  Fuck those other guys.,1
That‚Äôd make a lot of sense actually.   Let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs not something that contradicts previous movies.,1
"I‚Äôm not so sure we‚Äôd see the JSA. I think it‚Äôs far likelier we‚Äôll see the original, Egyptian versions set in Ancient Egypt.   But what do I know",2
"Yeah I agree. And I'm glad, because it was an unnecessary and constraining creative choice to make metas and superheros a relatively new occurrence.",1
I think this is the real answer,1
"I mean, sure. It could perfectly be like you said.  Then again, I did read about a screening of a version of the film where  [POSSIBLE SPOILER]   apparently Diana is powerless for most of the story and so she doesn‚Äôt draw too much attention on her. Then again there‚Äôs the whole shiny golden armor, which is visually as stealthy as a grenade, but who knows how it‚Äôs gonna play out.",0
"I fucking hate that honestly, tbh. At least try sticking to some continuity.",0
"I mean, MoS and BvS made a pretty darn big deal about Superman being the first superhero shown to the whole wolrd and the implications that carry from it, with most metahumans popping up only after his sacrifice.   Sure they could just ignore the foundations of the very universe these films are set in, that doesn‚Äôt mean they *should* tho. I don‚Äôt even think they‚Äôll go against their way to downright contradict previous movies, only acknowledge them on superficial levels, like Shazam did by the paper clips. They didn‚Äôt need to do that yet here they are.",1
"That was Transformers writers being morons, it had nothing to do with the idea of secret history itself. They actively retconned things every single film and they knew that‚Äôs what they were doing.",1
"I disagree, but alrighty",1
‚ÄúDying down‚Äù meaning that they‚Äôre gonna take some time to create another event level film.,1
nope. dead serious question.,1
Lol These morons don‚Äôt even read the comics and are the first one to get offended.,3
Good looking out!,3
"Constantine started it, and should have another movie and maybe this is blasphemy but I like Matt Ryan‚Äôs more than Keanu‚Äôs.",3
I know that he has already played in Aquaman but I thought that William Dafoe could have been a great dr fate,1
Nothing beats IJ2's [design](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/5c/fc/5c5cfca0c8f27865b4657535df4106e8.jpg) for me. Helmet's sexy af.,3
Holy shit that would be amazing but I don‚Äôt think him or cruise look like Kent Nelson lol.,3
Keanu Reeves as Dr Fate was my personal choice for years.,3
From the rumors they want him back as constantine,1
Kind of like with Vandal savage on legends.,3
Damn that sounds great!,1
"Haha, fair point",1
"I respectfully disagree, but I digress",0
"We've seen footage of her fighting terrorists in a mall, so I'm not sure how much stock I put into that. Like I said, going forward, I don't think what happened in the early movies is gonna matter all that much regarding where the upcoming flicks go.",1
They don't care about the Snyder films.,1
"There's no real reason to. If they have a good idea for a future movie and it might contradict something that came before, they shouldn't be barred from doing so.",0
"We do not know what's going to happen unless we see the film, but I think Shazam! is a good indication of how they will handle such things from now on. Honestly, if all this leads to great films and the introduction of many new heroes then I am ok with not keeping continuity.",1
"So tell that to WB, tell Patty Jenkins; I say, WB asked James Wan not to approach Snyder to ask for advice on Aquaman and for something they have turned a deaf ear in everything related to the ""Snyder Cut"", in the end the study points to the public outside social networks Not people like us.",0
"Exactly without Cap, Iron Man Hulk and Thor they really don‚Äôt have anything worthwhile on the horizon till they reboot FF and X-men",0
Who is offended? Did I say I was? I guess you are being a moron by assuming I‚Äôm offended,0
I'm with you on this one. Keanu did a solid job but that wasn't Constantine.   I can't wait to see JLD on the big screen with hopefully more R-rated material. I really don't want to see DC universe turn into a marvel-like kid friendly Disney movies. There is time and place for those but if they make all of their movies like that it will be a real shame.,2
"I'm pretty sure everybody agrees with you. Keanu was in a great movie with a bad title. If that movie was called almost anything other than Constantine, I feel like it would have made a lot of money. But Matt Ryan IS Constantine. I don't think I can see anybody else in the role.",1
Wow. Never seen that. Yup. That is the gold standard right there.,1
He had the best victory animation too in that game,1
He might play the original..nabu,3
Momoa doesn‚Äôt look like Arthur Curry. I‚Äôm just saying.,3
Chad Stahelski did WB/DC a favor by doing uncredited reshoots for Birds of Prey. Maybe he can convince Keanu to take on the roll and in return he gets to direct a Doctor Fate movie?,1
A man of good taste I see,1
Matt Ryan is the only Constantine I want,3
"Fighting terrorists in a mall doesn‚Äôt sound like a world shattering canon inconsistency to me, but again we‚Äôll see.",0
"I don't care. They should still remain consistent, even the first movie made it clear something happened that made her go underground. Stay consistent, it's just very cheap when they don't respect their own continuity tbh.",0
"Sure thing, sure thing.",1
">Exactly without Cap, Iron Man Hulk and Thor they really don‚Äôt have anything worthwhile on the horizon till  This is a franchise that made a movie about Rocket Raccoon that was a bigger draw at the box office than the return of Superman. Not having Cap, Iron Man or Hulk is not any sort of handicap. The notoriety of the characters involved doesn't matter anymore. They'll be fine.",1
"Thor is still around though and Doctor Strange has a fair amount of attraction to it, as well as black panther 2 and guardians 3",1
"Have you read any of Batman: Damned? I think it's one of the first storyline arcs involving Constantine \*that I've read\*, and I'm curious as to how it lines up with what you'd consider to be ""Constantine"".  &#x200B;  edit: I left out some words to clarify that it's one of the first storyline arcs involving Constantine that I've read. I realize that there is quite a bit of material featuring Constantine that happened WAY before this series. Sorry for confusion.",1
Agreed but sadly it's not up to us. I would prefer if he played Dr fate or someone like that. Jowever I wouldnt complain if he was constatine again as well.,1
It seems so to me. But yes we shall see.,1
"> They should still remain consistent  Like I said, there's really no point. They're moving on, and it's not as though people are gonna be rioting and refusing to watch the movie because it contradicts stuff in an older movie.",1
"Let me ask you something and I want you to answer me seriously, what would happen if the rumors were true that in WW84, Diana is a recognized hero (it is the only way you can explain that the tape takes place in the 80s) with which invalidates everything related to BvS and MOS (I say in the end it is seen that you are a Snyder acolyte), now if you answer me like the other two times you will only show me that you are scared of that possible scenario and try to give me by my side.",0
The success of the MCU started with the main avengers every movie after lead to end game so in order to follow the story people were kinda forced to watch Guardians and ms Marvel and Strange. Once endgame is over unless the next phase leads to Galactus or Doom I highly doubt the next phase will be as successful without Downey or Evans around especially since they are chopping up their universe between the theatres and their streaming network. Black Widow will underperform at the box office just wait and see. So I stand my ground on what I said,1
"Yes, I've read all of Damned and the rest of Black Label. There is also now Constantine that entered the Sandman universe, and most stories from Hellblazer is what I consider ""Constantine"". What was your point?",1
"Regardless, it's still a sequel to Wonder Woman that establishes it as a kind of person she once was, the line, ""I used to want to save the world."" Which implies she went away, for them to make WW a public hero would kind of be a cop out. I hope those rumors turn out to be false and still remain somewhat consistent in that respect. And while yeah, they're going in a new direction, it still takes place within the DCEU. The Suicide Squad is the same cast basically, even as far as to the same character designs and outfits.",0
"Oh, absolutely frightened of that scenario. Can‚Äôt even close my eyes without trembling. It‚Äôs evident that the only reason I‚Äôm not taking you seriously is fear, there‚Äôs no other reason. :P  Seriously though, I‚Äôll give you points for originality for the ‚ÄúSnyder acolyte‚Äù. That‚Äôs new.",1
"> The success of the MCU started with the main avengers   Who, with the possible exception of the Hulk, most people didn't know that much or care about prior to the MCU.  >story people were kinda forced to watch Guardians and ms Marvel and Strange  LOL no they weren't.   >Black Widow will underperform at the box office just wait and see. So I stand my ground on what I said  We'll see next year, won't we?",1
"I didn't have a point, I had a question.  I'm not very familiar with Constantine, aside from having seen the Keanu Reeves movie, but I have read Batman: Damned, so I was wanting to hear the opinion of someone familiar with what Constantine is all about, and hear whether the version of Constantine in ""Batman: Damned"" is a good representation of what I should expect if I'm looking for other Constantine stories.  I know the internet has a surplus of snarky people just looking to tear into other people's opinions as invalid, but I'm honestly just seeking your thoughts on whether or not the only Constantine material I've read is a good representation or not.  And... I'm not sure you mentioned that or not, but now I'm even more interested to know what you think of the Batman: Damned version.",1
"Again, a cop out to what exactly? A movie that's not likely to be continued in any meaningful way anytime soon? If they have a story idea and the biggest problem is it doesn't align with the earlier stuff, then go for it.",0
"Okay I apologise, I think after being on sub for sometime that's kind of all you see haha so let's start over.  Constantine is originally a book that came from Vertigo, their materials are usually more mature. If you ever want to get to know John Constantine that's where I would start. JC is often saving the world but it's not some grandiose war that he then shows off to the world about, he saves the say but nobody knows about it and he has a very snarky attitude.   John is an asshole who will do whatever it takes to accomplish his goals, even if it means putting people he loves at risk (he is arrogant enough to think that he can still save them afterwards). John has a lot of skeletons in his closet. He has done some fucked up things and he carries those with him.   Batman DAMNED was a very one-shot-let-us-introduce-DC-black-label kind of a book. So I wouldn't base any of the characters involved off of that book. (for example Batman is very different in most books than in BD)   If you want to skip reading and watch some of his stuff you can go with TV series from CW (which is probably one of the better ones) or my favorite are the Justice League Dark animated movie and of course Constantine:  City of Demons.   Enjoy!",1
"That contradicts the movie prior? To you, you may not care but if they keep stepping over stuff like this over ""creative choices,"" it will start looking like a mess like the X-Men movies. But regardless of cinematic universes, this should retain the narrative of the first one, which established Diana wasn't a public hero.",0
"I'd say Batman Damned was more Hellblazer than the NBC show or CW Constantine. He was way too soft, as the stories. Now, City of Demons was pretty good, that was pretty Constantine. Now, that new comic series that's coming, that one seems to be the most Hellblazer shit we've had since Hellblazer ended. I love it.",1
Thanks! I appreciate it!,1
"> That contradicts the movie prior?  Yeah, like I said, not seeing the loss or issue there.  >t will start looking like a mess like the X-Men movies.   If e get some absolute top tier stuff like Deadpool and Logan out of this, they can take a chainsaw to the canon for all I care.",1
"And CW is soft by definition, I used be excited for their shows at first but then they all turned into teenage drama trash, I'm saying Damned was just such a short story that I wouldn't base my opinion on any character just from that book alone. I love Hellblazer and enjoyed Damned because I love Hellblazer, but if I didn't read Hellblazer I wouldn't really know much about the character based on that book alone. Does that make sense?",0
You're not seeing a loss but it's fucking annoying when movies contradict each other in a way like this. But my opinion. Just fucking disagree with me and move on. Stop trying to change my mind.,0
LOL I'm not. You're the one who responded to me in the first place when I said that's probably what'll happen.,1
"If you are a fan of BvS and MOS, I can understand where you are going, but if you only liked WW, I will easily tell you that you can remove Diana's scenes in the present and you will see that it works as a solo film without connection with other movies, of all Forms in the film Diana's fate is left in the air after Steve's death, it is never mentioned that she moved away from the public (unlike BvS where it was more explicit).",1
"I liked all three. But yeah, BvS moreso it's frustrating tbh to me.",1
"Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if this storyline shows up in one way or the other.  And isn't Zoe Kravitz biracial?",3
"I prefer Selina's father to be the lion but Matt Reeves is really into Dark Victory and When In Rome ties into that heavy. It always bothers me, especially since the whole trilogy is about the falcone siblings. The Lion definitive storyline  for her felt better. Especially taking over her father's lost family.",1
That would be a nice idea,0
Nope Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet are her parents,0
"And they are both biracial themselves, I believe. So technically she is biracial.",3
"Both of whom are biracial. Lisa Bonet has a Jewish mother and a black father, while Lenny Kravitz has a black mother and a Jewish father.",3
Oh ok see I didnt know that lol,1
[OP rn](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/10-Guy.jpg),3
üòÇ   OP effed up the title and now I can‚Äôt stop giggling to even read the post.,3
Neither. They should do a Justice League movie.,3
"For anyone confused by the title, it should be ‚ÄúDiscussion: What if instead of a Justice League movie they did Justice League show?‚Äù",2
I think you might be the one higher than Snoop Dog.,2
What about a Justice league movie?,1
Yeah thanks dk how I fucked that up,2
"How dare you, Big Barda, I am your suPERIOR OFFICER!!",3
"Darkseid: From now on, call me... *Velvet Thunder.*",3
He was great in Batman/Superman: Apocalypse,3
"""Ah, Queen Hippolyta.  But, if you're here...  WHO'S GUARDING HADES?""",3
"yes, he has fantastic voice",3
This is who I‚Äôve always wanted Ava to cast! Love his voice in the animated film. As a big fan of Brooklyn Nine Nine it‚Äôll just sound Captain Holt in Darksied‚Äôs body.,3
Would you like him to just voice Darkseid or also do the motion capture?,3
"what have you done here, Peralta?",3
VINDICATIOOOOOOON!!!!,3
"He is VERY good, and my second choice as Darkseid.  But I have to go classic here with Michael Ironside. Ironside - Darkseid is.",3
INJECT THIS STRAIGHT INTO MY EYEBALLS!,3
"Is Darksied's codename Velvet Thunder? In all seriousness, I have always hoped Ava picks him to be Darksied",2
You know what a supervillain needs? *Gravitas*,2
Great voice. Haven‚Äôt seen him do enough dramatic acting to know about that side though,1
"I am entropy, I am death, I am VELVET THUNDER",2
"I'd rather he play the monitor or Namu. Someone with authority but who can potentially work in a comedic scene, if only as a straight man. Darkseid can never be funny.  I've always felt that Darkseid, being effectively the space devil, needs to have an almost seductive quality to his voice. Not really in a sexual way, but he need to have a certain charisma that is more important than gravitas.  That's why Michael Ironside worked so damn well. His voice isn't the deepest (in fact in the original airing of superman TAS they pitched him down in post, but then reversed it because his natural higher voice worked better) but he had charisma. He is saying and doing terrible things, but part of you WANTS to see him do it.  My pick for a live action darkseid is Bryan Cranston. With Avery Brooks as a close second.",2
Ship it!,1
1000% yes!,1
Omg yes that would be awesome,1
"Oh hell yeah, this is something I can get behind. That authority he carries.",1
100% on board! Velvet Thunder!,1
Spot on!,1
I am surprised and happy.,1
VINDICCAAAAAATIOOOOOOOOOON,1
Save him for Atrocitus. Christopher Judge should be Darkseid.,1
"Have they cast anyone in that New Gods movie yet? Because I can see this, with Oprah as Granny Goodness.",1
He even has the right features!,1
Cpt. Raymond Holt as Darkseid? Hell Yeahh,1
"your not desaad, your just some common bitch!",1
New captain alert,1
Honestly I would love nothing more than Michael Ironside to do it or the voice at least,1
"I've always loved the idea. And damn, his face is nearly perfect for mo-cap!",1
It took me awhile but he did grow on me as Darkseid and I think he's a good choice.,1
"Oh my god yes, save for Michael ironside being available.",1
I have been saying this for years! I think he would be absolutely perfect for the role!!!,1
"You should see him in Homicide: Life On The Street, he was robbed of soooo many emmies for his performances in that show. Acted his fucking heart out.  https://youtu.be/RWpUnXm6sFk",1
"Sorry, but it will always have to be Michael Ironside.  Or at least his voice.",0
isn't Ray Porter Darkseid ?,0
BooOOOOnnNNEEE!,3
"Granny, you duplicitous bitch.",3
How dare you detective Batman!,1
Was about to say he already nailed it once so more I say!,3
Are you kidding me? Captain Holt? I gotta see this magic.,3
"Oof, did not like that performance.",0
Underrated,2
Holy shit this is so fucking perfect.   Like God damn it,1
I‚Äôd like that but i‚Äôd also like to see ray porter‚Äôs version.,2
Motion Capture as well.,3
He‚Äôs already done the voice (check out Superman/Batman: Apocalypse) once before. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd be willing to do it again.,3
"What have you done here, Steppenwolf?",1
Ironside is so good just smooth but commanding etc I sometimes wonder if Brolin took that same vibe for mcu Thanos.,1
Great actor,3
He actually voiced Darkseid in Batman/Superman: Apocalypse.,2
Bing-pot!,1
Are you saying that the man who played the angriest person in gaming *shouldn't* play the angriest person in DC?,1
He‚Äôs done it once he can do it again,1
Whatever happens in Apokolips is none of your business.,3
"You made me genuinely laugh, Captain Holt is a sassy one",3
"I don't know if I see Thanos with that same Iron-seid vibe.  Iron-seid was a kind of Darkseid who was scheming and incredibly threatening, not to mention petty.  Brolin Thanos was always more sympathetic.",1
"Yes, because I feel like that's slightly typecasting.",1
BOOOOOONE!!!!!,3
"I dont actually mean as a character I meant more the voice and approach they went for, neither went for a  big deep monster gargaling type sounds, both are very threatening while sounding both intelligent, calm and somewhat mythical.",1
You're not DeSaad..... You're just some common bitch,3
"Ahh High Father, you've aged.",2
I still want that wildcat boxing movie for DC Black,2
Now that‚Äôs a waste of JDW,2
"I don't think we will see all of the JSA in the Black Adam film. I think we'll see 2 or 3 members, and the rest of the team will be mentioned or alluded to. Unless you are fancasting for a JSA movie, in which case carry on! Some interesting choices there for sure.",1
Brad Pitt as Jay Garrick,1
Their combined salaries alone would match the box office take.,1
I've got:  Alan Scott- Brad Pitt  Jay Garrick- George Clooney  Ted Grant- Bruce Willis  I really like  Jude Law as Doctor Fate,1
I can't wait for jay garrick. He's underrated.,1
Upvoted for the editing,1
"It's probably only going to only be Dr. Fate, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Atom Smasher, Stargirl since they have ties to ancient times and/or Black Adam. No need to jump the shark.",1
Waste? Mr. Terrific is vital part od dcu,0
I feel like he's too pretty to be Jay LOL. I've always imagined Jay to look like an average joe,1
"Take out Law and it‚Äôs and I don‚Äôt think their combined salaries would be that bad.  JDW is still fairly new to the industry, Clarke has fallen off a bit and the rest of them are mainly found on TV.  Edit: forgot about Liev, but I don‚Äôt think his salary would be that bad either",1
My first thought too. Some fancasts are practically All-Star casts.,1
I don‚Äôt think he would be for the DCEU.,1
"Reposting something I wrote some times ago:   With Matt Reeves' *The Batman* moving full steam ahead, I'd like to share with you an idea for a Batman movie that I had back when the DCEU was still whole. The movie, titled **Batman - After Dark**, would have been the 3rd entry in the DCEU after *Man of Steel* and *Wonder Woman*. Basically, the plot takes place during 3 nights, each one set in a different stage of Batman's career as the Caped Crusader.   During the first night, a young Batman investigates a string of high profile burglaries which leads to his first encounter with Selina Kyle aka Catwoman. The second night sees a more experienced Batman, aided by his protege Robin, chasing down a sadistic serial killer (Victor Zsasz) in Gotham's sewers who is supposed to be responsible for the kidnapping and killing of a dozen of teenage girls. The third night is set in the present times, where a broken down, but still highly capable Batman is lured into a trap by Deathstroke, who has abducted Catwoman and uses her as bait.   The movie's opening sequence follows Batman as he tracks Deathstroke to a warehouse where Catwoman is supposed to be held captive. As he is about to free her, he realizes that she's not Selina at all and the entire building has been rigged to explode. Batman manages to escape, but is badly wounded. In the ensuing fight with Deathstroke, our hero takes a serious beating and is ultimately defeated. When he comes to, Batman finds himself strapped to a surgical chair (with his mask still on), facing Hugo Strange. Strange begins to torture Batman to extract information about a certain serial killer and his victims. As he refuses to talk, Strange injects Batman with a bunch of psychoactive drugs designed to unlock his memories, leading him to hallucinate.  What follows is Batman drifting back and forth between the first and second night. Selina Kyle, the kidnapped girls, they begin to merge together. We also see brief flashbacks of Martha Wayne. As the interrogation progresses, it is revealed that Hugo Strange's own daughter was one of the kidnapped girls. She was never found. Ever since then Strange has been holding a grudge against Batman. He blames him for failing to find her. In the flashback we learn that Batman indeed couldn't stop Zsasz from killing the girls. It was then that he realized there were some evils even he could not defeat.    Eventually, Batman manages to free himself from the chair and begins to fight his way out of Strange's laboratory which happens to be situated below Arkham Asylum. The final fight is, once again, between a heavily drugged and gadget-less Batman and Deathstroke. Only this time Batman ends up victorious after breaking both of Deathstroke's arms.  In the movie's closing scene we see a montage a la Nolan of the three Batmans emerging from his mission just as the dawn breaks (cue Hans Zimmer's soaring music). The movie ends on a close-up of Batman's facial expressions which are all the same: stoical determination.  After credit scene #1: In his darkened penthouse office, Lex Luthor intently watches video footage of Batman's fight against Deathstroke. Next to him, an impatient Hugo Strange raises his voice, ""You've got what you wanted. Now I want what you promised me."" Cut to Luthor and Strange walking down a long dark corridor. At the end he opens the door to a white, well-lit room. In it, a terrified Victor Zsasz is strapped down in a chair. Strange enters. Luthor closes the door and walks away.  After credit scene #2: Back in his office, Luthor realizes he's not alone. From the shadow a woman's voice is heard, ""You gave me your word you wouldn't hurt him."" Catwoman emerges. ""And I didn't. Strange did,"" Luthor says with a slight mocking voice. ""Why do you care? Your debt is paid. We are even."" Catwoman retreats back into the shadow, but stops briefly, ""I hope you know what you're doing, Luthor. You're playing with forces far beyond your control."" Luthor is about to retort when his phone gives off some sort of alarm. He takes a look at it, opens the door to his balcony and watches something in the distance. ""Oh, I know exactly what I'm doing,"" he mumbles to himself, then gets on the railings and jumps.  ----  Edit: My casting choices for this movie would have been as following:  Batman - Bradley Cooper  Catwoman - Kate Beckinsale OR Eva Green  Hugo Strange - Mads Mikkelsen OR Mahershala Ali   Victor Zsasz - Jackie Earle Haley   Robin - Aaron Taylor-Johnson  Deathstroke - Mark Dacascos  Lex Luthor - Timothy Olyphant",2
Good pitch bud!! You should post it,1
Ok. Sorry,1
"sorry, didnt want to be harsh or anything. have a good day",1
"No, that was a constructive criticism. Don't worry",1
origional made it for my justusposters insta but i tought it would fit here as well,0
The little girl's mother was an Wayne employ that died when the building collapse. Wallace says that his wife left him.,3
"Pretty sure Wallace said his wife left him after he lost his legs, if his wife died in the Wayne building, wouldn't he have mentioned it?",2
"HOLLY MOLLY!!!!  I have seen BVS atleast 20 times, and never noticed this till today. Would have been nice if her name was Carrie Kelley.  Edit :  Well Interesting however didn't Mr. Wallace says in BvS that his wife walked out on him after he lost his legs?  There are three possibilities  1. It's her and Wallace lied about his wife walking out on him. Lex manipulated him into lying. 2. They're two different girls. ( Doesn't look like though ) 3. Since the photo is only present for a brief moment, they used the same girl for two characters.",3
"Well...it's possible, but if they were the same characters then it would add an unnecessary level of complexity which would kind of detract from the story (unless it's something to do with a 4 hour rough cut of the film which included this but they realized it wasn't necessary so they cut it.  Or  it's either two different girls who happen to look alike or they used the same girl because she was already around but did her hair and makeup a little differently.",1
"I honestly do not see the same girl. They just look different to me.  On another note, I never bought the idea that your wife would leave you if you lost your legs. Why would they do that? It'd be the opposite. They'd end up taking care of you for the rest of your life. Any married folks here? Say your spouse gets into an accident and loses a limb...you'd leaved them?! No way, you'd take care of them.  The way I was able to get past this is to think that it was his incorrigible despair that forced her out.",2
"Try Zack's app . Vero, ask him, he will answer you for sure. Maybe you know that, but  Zack's Vero is kinda fandom community.",1
Lex may have told him to lie,0
"He could have lied on Lex‚Äôs order like the woman from the village did, in order to make his situation and Superman look even worse and give him better chance of testifying.",0
"If we're going to entertain this then you're missing several other possibilities.  1. Sage's mom and Wally's wife are two different women.  Therefore, Sage's mom can die in the BZE and Wally's wife (not Sage's mom) can still walk out on him after the BZE.  This allows Sage to still be Wally's daughter in the picture but to avoid the insanity of arbitrarily lying without motive or conceivable purpose or likelihood of success. 2. Sage and Bruce were mistaken in believing her mom was dead.  We don't see a body, we don't get an aftermath.  While Sage believes her mom was in the upper stories of Wayne Tower, the fact is the BZE had been going on for minutes already now (that's the whole intro sequence of Bruce getting to the tower and that's in media res to boot).  A parent with a young child in the city might not sit still at her desk waiting for Jack to get the OK from the boss.  When a literal alien invasion is occurring, she might make her way down before getting the official word.  In which case, despite Sage's fears... her mom is alive to later leave Wally and keep his story consistent *without* the insanity of ""just lie cuz Lex told you to!"" - It's a little insane to insist upon the ""integrity of intention"" for Sage's pointing scene as absolute truth, but then to gut all of Keefe's later scenes a lying through his teeth for no apparent reason.  Again, what's the motive? 3. It's irrelevant.  Considering no storytelling hinges on this in any material way, it may literally not matter....",1
"Me neither. The thought never crossed my mind, but now it adds more depth to Wallace‚Äôs character. His wife probably did die, and he became too bitter to take care of his kid.",1
Unfortunately that stuff can happen. People can‚Äôt handle the change or the stress. It‚Äôs not good but it‚Äôs out there.,1
"I could not agree more.  The child is what makes it more baffling.  It‚Äôs not like a newborn child, that‚Äôs a fully cognizant kid in school.  How the hell does the mother explain to her that they‚Äôre leaving dad?  ‚ÄúHoney, I know you love daddy but he lost his legs in a terrorist attack and he just hasn‚Äôt exactly handled it very well in the 18 months we‚Äôve given him to get over it so we‚Äôre giving up on him and leaving.‚Äù  Is she trying to raise the most heartless creature in existence?",1
That‚Äôs more than likely what happened if she did leave him. He became too bitter and angry for her to endure it.,0
Why would he do that? How that lie would help him in any way?,3
"How exactly would that conversation go?  Keefe is an emotional guy who can't control his impulses.  If he could, he wouldn't subject himself to 40-years Federal prison.  He wouldn't desecrate a Federal monument in broad daylight in front of law enforcement.  He could also make his point without getting violent, resisting arrest, or making threats.  He's a hothead who blurts out whatever he wants to say.  He swears at Lex as the first thing out of his mouth.  He's vulgar and angry when he tells Finch about his piss.  When he's questioned by Soledad, knowing he's on camera, he can barely keep it together... raising his voice, bringing up blood and war, and decrying the nation's hero.  This is not who Lex would pick to reliably lie.  Much less be able to motivate Wallace TO lie.  He can't buy Wally off.  If money mattered to Wally he wouldn't have tried to deface Superman's monument in a way that he gets caught.  The legal bills alone are going to bankrupt him, not to mention being convicted and going away for 40 years.  Wally cares more about the message OVER money, which is why it's plausible that he'd return checks to send a message... and why he's a suitable patsy for Lex's plan.  If Wally was money motivated, then no one would believe he'd send back checks and no one would believe it was Wally and then he's be a terrible patsy for Lex's plan.  The story itself makes no sense in terms of a superior narrative to get him his aim.  Kahina proves that death gets you in the door.  Why would Lex tell Wally to give UP on the ACTUAL death story to replace it with a lesser living leaving wife story?  With death there's no hope of reunion.  With leaving you can always reconcile... there's hope of restoration.  Finally, the lie is faulty in its ability to actually hold up.  Kahina's story is already covered up three times over by Lex's conspiracy, the Nairomi government atrocities, and the CIA's classified involvement... it's impossible for the Senators to verify her story.  Plus the motive is given to us expressly... she was paid.  For Wally, it's a crazy story to say, ""My wife and daughter are alive and out there and I'm angry at the separation.""  When the wife can be DEMONSTRABLY PROVEN to be dead!  Moreover, there's a time differential in the story.  Keefe puts the departure AFTER he's dealing with the loss of his legs (""Half a man, can't even piss"")... meaning she left BECAUSE OF the legs (or, more likely, his seething resentment over their loss).  If we're suggesting she was actually killed during the BZE, she'd be MISSING during that part of his story and he'd be unable to corroborate.  She wouldn't have come to the hospital, checked him out, and dealt with his limb loss to be witnessed by anyone or others.  She would have disappeared day of the BZE with no corroboration.  Again, what would the conversation between Lex and Wally be?  How could Lex convince Wally to make this completely arbitrary, inferior lie, that subjects him to perjury for what?  A chance to confront Superman?  To talk before Congress?  Kahina got that with a death narrative already, why would a lie get him these things better and without subjecting him to criminal liability for perjury or discrediting his entire story once the lie was caught.  Plus there's the problem of Wally's attitude towards Bruce.  If the boss saved his daughter's life TOO... no matter how SELF loathing Wally might be or angry at Bruce for other things, it's hard to justify sending his angry checks to Bruce if the man saved your daughter's life.  It doesn't matter if you believe Wally actually did it, what matters is that Lex believes in-story that the WORLD will believe Wally was angry at Bruce enough to return checks and write notes.  That story completely fails to track if Bruce saved your daughter's life!",2
"I mean, there's nothing to really suggest that though, everything lex lied about/ had others lie about is shown in the UC, this isn't. But even still, wouldn't ""Superman caused the death of my wife"" make him see *way* worse than ""he caused the breakdown of my marriage""?",2
"Well the woman from the village was paid by Lex to lie. Wally lying could be used to make his story more sympathetic and paint Superman‚Äôs actions is a worse light and making it so that he could have a better chance of being allowed to testify, getting the bomb into the courtroom.",0
Lex. We don‚Äôt know the exact details lex had promised to him,0
Lex has more than just money. He accepted the wheelchair that Lex had. Wally was impulsive but he wasalao desperate.  Wally didn‚Äôt return those checks. Lex did.,1
"It could, but their is plenty of ways to spin things. His wife‚Äôs death can be viewed as not Superman‚Äôs fault because he was trying to stop Zod and he couldn‚Äôt save everyone. But if they are just focusing more on how Wally‚Äôs life went to hell because of Superman, his wife leaving him instead could in a way make it look worse. And it makes him seem even more bitter, bitter enough to blow up the courtroom.",0
Yeah this is where this theory completely loses me.  I don‚Äôt see any way someone can spin his wife leaving him because of his legs making Superman look worse than his wife literally dying because of Superman.  Her dying would create more sympathy for him.  Her leaving just makes her look shallow considering they have a child and she‚Äôs taking the child from her father.,2
"How the ""my wife left me because of Superman"" is any better than ""my wife died because of Superman""? It seems the exactly opposite to me. He could blame Superman for the death of his wife but not for leaving him.   I really do not understand this theory. It's worst than the theory that the little girl was Batgirl.",2
"There is nothing more to know, is there? He gave him the chair with the bomb in exchange of him going to the hearings. Wallace did not know about the bomb. I do not see how this theory  offers anything new.",1
"Again, spell out the conversation.  Lex has nothing to offer and nothing to gain from the lie.  This is purely shoe-horning to make the observation fit, not something that makes any kind of sense in the story.  List how Lex benefits from the lie OVER the death.  Explain why Finch would be more convinced by a walk out over a death.  Explain why Finch would put Wally on air on next to her during press conferences WITHOUT vetting his story which is easily checked. Then list why Wally would agree to risk more criminal charges TO lie OVER the the death.  It makes absolutely no sense.  Regardless of whether Lex sent the checks or not (he didn't :P), under your own theory, he's undermining his OWN patsy plan by making it LESS plausible, by using his patsy's HERO as a target.  You can believe a man will still be ungrateful for his own life... it's a stretch he'll hate the hero who saves his daughter's life.  It fails the smell test as something Lex wants out there.",2
">His wife‚Äôs death can be viewed as not Superman‚Äôs fault because he was trying to stop Zod and he couldn‚Äôt save everyone.  So can the loss of his legs, neither were superman's fault. But saying ""He caused the death of my wife and endangered my child"" is going to have a much larger impact than ""he caused the loss of my legs and my wife left me"".  >his wife leaving him instead could in a way make it look worse. And it makes him seem even more bitter, bitter enough to blow up the courtroom.   Pretty sure causing the death of your wife is going to make you way more bitter than her leaving you.  I just don't think this is an intentional thing, we don't even know if the girls are the same actor, let alone the same charcater. I really feel like this is grasping at straws, if it were intentional I would have felt it would have been addressed in the UC.",2
"It‚Äôs more so showing how Superman led to his life being even worse. But what it also does is make Wally a certain kind of bitter. Because losing your wife is one thing, losing your wife because you lost your legs? That hits your pride, that hits your belief in love. And that can add to Wally being the one behind the bombing according to the media and the police, so that Lex can cover his tracks even more.",0
"Its not about blaming Superman specifically for his wife leaving. It‚Äôs for both showing how Superman‚Äôs actions/negligence had lead Wally‚Äôs life to being shit, and it makes Wally SEEM more bitter to the point that he could be a Suicide bomber and no one would ask too many questions.",0
"There‚Äôs always a lot more to know. If anything else, it‚Äôs a nice detail",0
"Finch would listen either way since the conversation is coming from a person who was directly affected by the Black Zero, you know: missing legs and all.  You just said that Lex was able to hide Naomi‚Äôs family from being found out. You don‚Äôt think Lex can do the same, whether or not Wally‚Äôs wife is alive?  Again, Lex. Dude, Lex has all this power. If he tells you, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it‚Äù, more than likely that means he‚Äôs got you covered. We‚Äôre talking about the smartest man in the world here.  Where does it say that Wallace hates Bruce? He never mentions Bruce after the opening scene.",1
"Dude, Lex sent the checks. A) the checks said ‚Äúyou let your family die‚Äù B) Lex KNOWS who Bruce Wayne is and C) in his rooftop conversation with Superman he says ‚ÄúRipe fruit his hate. Two years growing but it did not take much to push him over actually. Little red notes, Big Bang, YOU LET YOUR FAMILY DIE!‚Äù. Let‚Äôs just get that clear.  Also, Superman didn‚Äôt save his daughter‚Äôs (if it is his daughter‚Äôs) life, Bruce did. Cause even with the world engine gone, it was the fight between him and Zod that brought down the building and if Bruce wasn‚Äôt there she would have been crushed.",1
"I‚Äôm aware of the issue with the first part, but again it‚Äôs all how you spin things. Lex‚Äôs whole plan is about controlling the narrative of Superman.   I don‚Äôt know about that second disagreement. Her death can make you bitter, yes. But her leaving you after losing your legs because she can‚Äôt or doesn‚Äôt want to deal with you? That can make you bitter because you‚Äôre not just losing your wife, you‚Äôre pride as a man and belief in love is hit.",1
"> But what it also does is make Wally a certain kind of bitter. Because losing your wife is one thing, losing your wife because you lost your legs? That hits your pride, that hits your belief in love.  Dude, what the fuck are you talking about?  Are you saying that Wally is lying about his wife leaving instead of saying she actually died because he thinks the lie will make the media think he‚Äôs bitter about his loss of pride?  Because it basically just sounds like you‚Äôre defending the creative choice of Snyder and Terrio to have her leave him when that literally isn‚Äôt even the discussion.  BvS is nearly 2 years after the day he lost his legs.  So even if your logic was ‚ÄúLex and Wally decided it sounds better to say she left him‚Äù (which makes no sense in the context of Wallys character considering the movie made it clear he didn‚Äôt think he was going to die), how could he have possibly known he would even meet Lex to do this?  Did he cover up his wife‚Äôs death for two years?  What you‚Äôre saying makes absolutely no sense within the plot of the movie.  I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm entertaining this lol.",2
The details say that they are not the same girl any way!,2
"- If Finch would listen either way there's no motive to lie. - No, I said TWO governments AND Lex could TEMPORARILY hide a secret.  Lois still pierces Lex's conspiracy and the CIA cover-up, and happens to be out-of-Nairomi before the Nairomi government sweeps up. Kahina's circumstance is completely different from Wally's under this theory where his DAUGHTER is ALIVE.  Two years on she'd be a tween, her dad is making national news and claiming her mom- who she saw die- is still alive and walked out on them.  No.  Lex can't fix that.  He couldn't even fix his own evidence which is why he goes down for Capital Hill. - Lex has power, he's not omnipotent, psychic, or a time traveler.  He can't rope Wally into a conspiracy 2 years later and have it hold up.  For 2 years Wally has been operating under the reality that his wife is dead in the BZE (under this interpretation)... then he's just supposed to agree with Lex on his say so on national TV and in front of Congress?  ""Who the #$@! are you?"" ""I'm the smartest man in the room, I know you lost your wife in the BZE but I want you to lie to Congress for me."" ""What, why?"" ""Don't worry about it, because I said so.""  This doesn't satisfy Wally, much less the viewer to explain WHY Lex wants him to lie. - The checks, written as Wally, read:     1. BRUCE WAYNE OPEN YOUR EYES      2. B. WAYNE I AM YOUR GHOST      3. BRUCE NO TRUCE      4. B. WAYNE I HAUNT YOU      5. BRUCE WAYNE = BLIND  These make no sense if Wally loves Bruce and sees him as the hero that saved his daughter.  If they make no sense, then Bruce wouldn't believe Wally wrote them and he wouldn't fall for Lex's patsy plan.  It's precisely because the checks are plausible- that we can believe Wally would send them and be angry at Bruce- that Bruce too believes Wally did it... and DOESN'T suspect some larger conspiracy or mastermind behind Wally.",1
"Wrong.  ""You let your family die"" was NOT a check... it was a news clipping that arrived AFTER Lex had planted the bomb on Keefe and staged his apartment to look like the sole bomber responsible.  The CHECKS arrived MONTHLY according to Greg.  So what happens when Keefe fails to get his first check or Greg gets the returned check 1 month into the program?  You don't think Keefe will complain?  Reach out?  Ask why?  You don't think the Fund won't reach back and ask what's up?  Moreover, why in the world is Lex doing this one specific action to one specific guy TWO YEARS before he has plans?  How can he predict that Wally doesn't die in a ditch, get arrested for assault, reform and find love, clean up to get custody or visitation, etc?  There is NO WAY to use JUST the checks to get Wally from accident to Capital Hill with the statue protest in-between.  There's no way to predict that Keefe would use red block letters to protest on Superman's statue or not scream out ""Where's my checks?"" or that Bruce doesn't pop-in to check on the man he personally saved on the BZE.  Lex can't control ANY of these factors.  Lex enters Wally's story exactly when the film shows us he did.  If Keefe sends the checks back ALL of the above is answered. He doesn't inquire because HE's doing it.  The Fund's follow up gets shot down because HE knows WHY he returned the checks.  No prediction is required because Lex isn't insanely trying to fortune tell two years into the future. Keefe's protest is consistent with the checks because HE sent them.  Keefe DOESN'T cry out for his checks at his arrest because HE sent them.  And it doesn't matter if Bruce drops in to check up because there is no two-year patsy plan trying to avoid attention until the bombing... quite the reverse, Keefe WANTS attention, which is exactly the OPPOSITE of what Lex would want two years prior to the bombing.  As for the quote, nothing in the quote has Lex taking PERSONAL responsibility.  You can interpret ""It did not take [me] much to push him"" equally with ""It did not take [circumstances] much to push him""... Lex ONLY takes credit for the LAST note which isn't a check.  I never claimed Superman saved Sage, you seem to misapprehending what I wrote.",1
"> I don‚Äôt know about that second disagreement. Her death can make you bitter, yes. But her leaving you after losing your legs because she can‚Äôt or doesn‚Äôt want to deal with you? That can make you bitter because you‚Äôre not just losing your wife, you‚Äôre pride as a man and belief in love is hit.  Uh... I mean this would make sense if Lex lied to Wally and said his wife left him when she actually died, causing him to feel worse and more insecure about his legs.  In the context of the story, it literally makes no sense lol.  We‚Äôre talking about Lex controlling the narrative on Superman right?  Superman causing his wife to die would make people hate him for taking everything from Wally.  His wife just leaving him and taking their kid with her for him losing his legs would just make people think the wife is a heartless asshole.  If anything, the lie only helps Superman compared to telling the truth.",1
"Wait hold on, You‚Äôre confusing some thing about what I‚Äôm saying. Wally‚Äôs not agreeing with Lex to make him sound Better, Lex would be MANIPULATING him. Saying, say your wife left you, it will ‚Äúsound better‚Äù. But in reality, it‚Äôs just to add to his bitter profile to make him being a Suicide bomber more likely for the media, but Wally wouldn‚Äôt know that. He would just trust Lex since he bailed him out and is helping him go against Superman in a way. You took that a whole different way.   Also um, calm down dude? We‚Äôre just talking about a theory. I don‚Äôt even agree with it. I‚Äôm just giving my thoughts.",0
"Lex KNEW about Lois‚Äô investigation.   And yet along with the checks is newspaper cut out of the Wayne Murders, and said cut has ‚ÄúYou let your family die‚Äù written in the same red marker as the rest of the checks. So more than likely, Lex was the one stopping the checks. Bruce believes Wally did, but more than likely Wallace didn‚Äôt know about the checks.   Wallace hates Superman for what happened. He was willing to vandalize a freaking monument and risk jail time. Lex more than likely expressed his own dislike about Superman, like how Lex would normally do.",0
But we don‚Äôt know when Wallace stopped getting those checks. Lex said ‚Äúlittle red notes‚Äù in plural form. Which he more than likely wrote the words on the checks. The fact that Bruce wasn‚Äôt even notified should tell you that Lex was doing something within Wayne Enterprises.   And it‚Äôs Lex. Dude is all about the long game.,1
"The one that came in that morning was a newspaper clipping with what was assumed to be a check. The other ones were checks sent back with the same red writing. And Lex said little red noteS. Plural. Lex himself was responsible for the Big Bang, you really think he wasn‚Äôt responsible for the others? Lex Luthor was intercepting Keefe‚Äôs checks, otherwise Keefe wouldn‚Äôt be defacing statues and going full conspiracy theorist in a shitty apartment. Bruce asked Greg why he hadn‚Äôt seen those checks before and Greg didn‚Äôt know. Lex Luthor chose him because his situation would push Bruce, hitting his sense of guilt and powerlessness for not being able to save Keefe, just as he was not able to do anything during the Kryptonian invasion and save his employees.   Think about it, the checks were telling Bruce to open his eyes, that he is blind, that he himself is Bruce Wayne‚Äôs ghost and he haunts him. Now why would Keefe think Bruce Wayne apart from paying his medical bills would be able to do anything about Superman? Why would Keefe put so much responsibility on Bruce? He doesn‚Äôt know Bruce is Batman, he doesn‚Äôt know the personal issues he‚Äôs been dealing with. But who does have the means to find out who Bruce is? To figure out what he‚Äôs feeling? Lex. And Lex most likely saved the notes for after Wally defaced the statue to match up with his writing. And Bruce is dealing with his own personal hell, if he has no reason to suspect that Wally isn‚Äôt getting cared for, he‚Äôs not going to check. Batman‚Äôs obsession was with Superman and his own feelings of rage and powerlessness. He was pretty much having an existential crisis in the film, doubting his whole career as Batman.   Lex has controlled so much of the story. He controlled the situation in Africa, making a situation and making sure Lois would be sent there in order to lure Superman. Then he had KG Beast set up bodies to look like Superman killed them with heat vision and paid a women in the village to lie about it in court. Then had KG Beast kill that woman to keep her from ever telling the truth. He took the criminals Batman was branding and had KG Beast set up THEIR deaths to make Superman think Batman was an enemy. He invited both Bruce and Superman to his benefit for the Library  to not only lure Bruce into hacking his systems so he could learn about the Kryptonite, it was also to get Bruce and Clark to meet and further build tension between them. And he also used Keefe to further turn the world against Superman in the bombing but to also further push Batman. And there‚Äôs even more than that. He was using and playing everyone from the beginning. Do you really think he didn‚Äôt play a part in the checks?",1
"And this part is more about Lex using that narrative towards convincing people of Wally being a Suicide Bomber, not so much for the trial.",0
How could they possibly lie about it lol  He didn‚Äôt meet Lex for almost 2 years.  How could *no one else* know his wife actually died instead of left him?  I‚Äôm using aggressive expressions to try and emphasize the ridiculousness of what you‚Äôre saying.,2
"None of that explains why he would lie INSTEAD OF tell the truth.  Lex needs a convincing argument to explain TO Keefe that a nonsensical lie that won't hold up and will get him perjury is WORTH doing when the truth- by your OWN admission- will get him EXACTLY the same thing.  You keep forgetting that under this theory Sage is ALIVE for the last TWO YEARS.  How is Lex going to convince Keefe to say on national TV, ""Sage, your mom's alive and left us."" when Sage was there to SEE her die?  You don't sweep this under the rug or shrug and say, ""Trust me!""  If Lex had that kind of control over Keefe he'd say, ""Hey, maybe don't buy any fresh groceries before the hearing.  Why?  Just trust me...""  The groceries PROVE Lex doesn't have that level of control, prediction, or planning.",1
"We do know because of the quantity of checks and because Greg says monthly.  Even if it stopped 6 months ago, both sides would reach out in ways that are beyond Lex's control.  The protest PROVES that.  If it were about checks NOTHING stops Wally from blurting out, ""I want my Victims Fund Checks!"" on national TV.  In which case, guess what, they'd investigate and fix the check situation and Lex loses his patsy... which is exactly why Wally WASN'T a part of the plan until AFTER the protest.  But that's too short to Capital Hill to account for all the checks, therefore, Wally returned the checks himself.  Lex saying notes plural only requires *awareness* not responsibility.  Given that the checks are a form of protest and Lex is telling Keefe he'll help him protest, it's plausible that Keefe showed Lex that he'd been returning checks.  That's sufficient to clear the awareness hurdle to explain BOTH Lex's awareness AND manipulation by sending the last copycat newspaper note.  Lex is a patient planner, for sure, which is why he sits on his plans for months until he finds Kryptonite.  Nonetheless, such patience is rational and logical and lends towards concrete predictable goals.  There is NO WAY to use the interception of checks to predictably create the patsy he needs TWO YEARS later.",1
"Dude, it‚Äôs LEX. He has the knowledge and resources to do just about anything as seen with his entire plan. He can bribe, he‚Äôs willing to assassinate, he can falsify records. I‚Äôm not saying this is what happened, but given everything else that Lex has done in this film it‚Äôs not a huge leap in logic for me to think that he could have done that as well.",0
Don‚Äôt know. We don‚Äôt know what the conversation was that convinced Wallace to send Superman to what was borderline a trial.,1
"Again, BRUCE DIDNT EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT. We can assume that Lex more than likely had an employee not mention it to the boss. Wallace more than likely WAS a part of the plan even before the protest.   Him literally acknowledging the notes, as is he knew about about the checks, somehow means that he had nothing to do with them, even though said checks and newspaper clip all have similar writing on them. Come on, dude.",0
But you‚Äôre just thinking about it from a records standpoint.  Does Wally have no friends or family that would see him?  Wouldn‚Äôt Bruce know she died?  Is Wally so bitter that he gave up his daughter for the sake of a story?  It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all lol.  If the logic is ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs Lex‚Äù than if it‚Äôs true it‚Äôs just a terrible plot point and it‚Äôs a good thing they didn‚Äôt focus on it lol.,1
"We don't NEED to know that because Keefe GIVES it to us.  In the SANE interpretation, where Keefe has been telling the truth all along and is completely unconnected to Sage... everything lines up!  Keefe is absolutely angry at Superman.  That's what the protest is about.  Whether the loss of his legs, family, or both.  It's consistent. [Not consistent is it being about checks, because you don't throw yourself in prison for 40 years as your first move to resolve checks... plus if it were about checks he'd SAY 'Where are my checks!?' and that would start an investigation which would completely resolve this, undermining the idea that this was Lex's plan from the start.]  Keefe wants his TRUTH to be heard.  That's why he protests and that's exactly what Lex is offering.  Clean up and connections so he can tell his TRUTH to Finch... get America to ""wake up"" and confront Superman.  These are all things he explicitly says he wants.  These are all things that are undermined if he's lying for Lex for NO APPARENT REASON.  Heck, in his own words it's about FLESH AND BLOOD... how is a living leaving wife more ""flesh and blood"" than one who DIED in a tower?  All his statements line up with exactly what Lex is offering and gives WITHOUT lying.  If a lie has no motive, then it's insane to insist upon it... if simply the *possibility* of lying is sufficient argument, then I might as well say:    - Sage's mom is alive because Sage was lying when she pointed to the tower.   - Plot twist: Wallace's photo is a stock photo that came with the frame and he's been lying for no reason.   - Lex had nothing to do with anything, he was lying on the helipad.    It's not sufficient to say ""They *could* be lying.""  Yeah, *anyone* can lie... but you NEED means, motive, and opportunity.  The Sage lie lacks means because it's easily vetted, fact-checked, and denied. It triggers actions and rights (if the mom is living, Keefe is entitled to visitation, if his a public figure, they'll track her down so he can see Sage... and when Sage says, ""But my mom's been dead for two years."" the lie falls apart).  It falls apart a dozen other ways too.  It's two years later, they've identified all the bodies by now or pronounced her legally dead... he's been living like she's dead.  You can't retroactively apply the lie to your last two years of living!  It lacks motive because as of yet NO ONE has explained how a living leaving wife is MORE persuasive than one that died directly due to Superman.  It lacks opportunity because Wally wasn't apart of the alleged conspiracy until two years LATER.  He didn't know TO lie UNTIL Lex tells him to under this theory.  So for 2 years he's been telling everyone and acting like his wife is dead... aren't they all going to confront him on that when his public story contradicts that?  No means, no motive, and only a window of opportunity... it makes no sense WHY this would happen and adds nothing to the story!",1
"I also said bribes and assassinations. Also, we don‚Äôt know about Wally‚Äôs family and friends. He may not have much. In fact having family and friends could arguably make his fall even more confusing since they would probably help him out before he got to that point.  Edit: Also, Bruce is doing his own thing. He didn‚Äôt know what was happening with Wally, and once the Capitol exploded, he went into full ‚Äúfuck Superman‚Äù mode instead of taking time to think, cause the whole point of Bruce in this story is that he‚Äôs being irrational.",1
"I‚Äôm sorry you just have to ignore way too much for this to make sense.  Wallace was literally like 5 feet away from his ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù.  Are they both oblivious?  I get it was hard to see but the details of the scene show how close they were to each other.  And to say Bruce Wayne wasn‚Äôt aware of a global headline about Superman standing trial and one of his former employees being a huge part of the trial is a huge reach and makes him seem oblivious if true.  He was already planning to get kryptonite before the capital explosion even happened.  Don‚Äôt you think a guy who‚Äôs been obsessing over this alien would be following this story like a hawk?  I know he didn‚Äôt know Wallace was returning the checks (which is also kind of ridiculous unless the trial just came out of the blue), but that doesn‚Äôt mean he wasn‚Äôt aware of the trial and the information involved in it.",1
"What are you talking about Wallace and his Daughter being five feet apart? What is this in reference to?  I‚Äôm not saying Bruce wasn‚Äôt aware of the trial, But Wally‚Äôs entry was late. And as we see in the movie, Bruce has no idea what was happening with Wally. Even though he maybe be paying attention to the story, the problem is Bruce is only seeing what he himself wants to see. That‚Äôs his problem throughout the whole movie, he isn‚Äôt interested in anything that doesn‚Äôt either help him kill Superman or further justify it. And it‚Äôs also not ridiculous for Bruce to not know about the checks because Lex was keeping them from him. Lex intercepted Wally‚Äôs checks and then sent them to Bruce with the red writing to make it look like it was from Wally.",0
"Rewatch the black zero scene.  The girl we are discussing that could be his daughter is literally in camera shot of Wallace on the ground while he‚Äôs saying he can‚Äôt feel his legs.  > And it‚Äôs also not ridiculous for Bruce to not know about the checks because Lex was keeping them from him. Lex intercepted Wally‚Äôs checks and then sent them to Bruce with the red writing to make it look like it was from Wally.  Dude... what??????  How did you write the first sentence then write the next sentence and not think to yourself, ‚Äúwait, what I just said makes no sense‚Äù.  Lex was keeping the checks from Wallace, not Bruce.  He literally was sending them back to Bruce.  If anything he wanted Bruce to see it.  That isn‚Äôt even addressing the point mind you, that is if Wallace is making national news as the face of this Superman trial, how could no one at Wayne enterprises tell Bruce Wallace is sending the checks back with cryptic, threatening messages on it?  Like, Wallace was on the news well before the trial when he defaced Superman‚Äôs monument.  He‚Äôs literally on TV screaming ‚ÄúI worked for Bruce Wayne‚Äù getting shoved into a cop car.  You‚Äôre just making excuses for Bruce (and anyone who knows him that watches TV if he happened to miss that story) being completely oblivious to things that he couldn‚Äôt possibly avoid.",1
"Okay? He‚Äôs dealing with his legs being crushed. But sure, they could have acted that scene in a way to show him asking for his daughter or something if that was what they were pursuing. But again, dudes legs were crushed, he‚Äôs a bit occupied.  And think about it again, Lex was keeping the checks from Wallace, but he was also keeping Bruce from knowing that Wally wasn‚Äôt getting them. When Bruce asks Greg ‚Äúwhy haven‚Äôt I seen these?‚Äù And Greg said he doesn‚Äôt know and they are working on it, THAT was Lex. Lex intercepted Wally‚Äôs checks and then sent them to Bruce with the red writing. Lex even says that when talking to Superman on the rooftop. ‚ÄúTwo years brewing but it did not take much to push him over actually. Little red notes, a Big Bang, you let your family die!‚Äù",0
"> And think about it again ... he was also keeping Bruce from knowing that Wally wasn‚Äôt getting them.

There‚Äôs literally no point in having a discussion about this if anytime a plot hole in your theory comes up you just say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs Lex‚Äù.

And also, I‚Äôm not arguing for this theory of the girl being his daughter. I was just sharing my thoughts on it, going along with what that theory would mean and how it could be true. I‚Äôm just talking. Whether the theory is true or not doesn‚Äôt really change much of the story, it just possibly adds a new layer.",0

We went from ‚Äúit‚Äôs possible Wallace agreed to lie that his wife left him instead of the truth about her dying because Lex got the African woman to lie‚Äù to this, and I have no idea how you pulled it off.  I don‚Äôt know if you did it on purpose or by accident but bravo I guess.",1
"To what? The stuff about Bruce? Dude, YOU were the one who first mentioned Bruce. I had to go into the stuff about Bruce and Lex to explain that part of it. When you said Lex was keeping the checks from Wallace, not Bruce, I had to go and show you what I‚Äôm talking about. That Lex kept things from both Wally AND Bruce to manipulate them both. He intercepted Wally‚Äôs checks and then wrote on them and sent them back to Bruce. Bruce wondered why he hadn‚Äôt seen them earlier and his employee Greg didn‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs cause of Lex.   Much of this is just coming from you not understanding what I‚Äôm saying. I mean earlier you thought I was saying that Wally went along with the lie to make him look bitter enough to be a Suicide Bomber when I wasn‚Äôt. I was saying Lex manipulated him without him knowing what real purpose he would serve.   And again, you‚Äôre taking this too seriously. I‚Äôm not trying to say this theory is real. I was just going along with it, seeing how the theory could work, what it could mean. I‚Äôm not twisting things for some malicious reason or to troll you. Just theorizing. The stuff about Bruce and Lex though, I‚Äôm serious about that.",1
"> Bruce wondered why he hadn‚Äôt seen them earlier and his employee Greg didn‚Äôt know, **that‚Äôs cause of Lex.**  This is literally not confirmed by anything in the movie.  You‚Äôre sitting here asking me why I‚Äôm getting serious and it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre trying to tell me things in the movie happened that you have no proof of.  > Much of this is just coming from you not understanding what I‚Äôm saying. I mean earlier you thought I was saying that Wally went along with the lie to make him look bitter enough to be a Suicide Bomber when I wasn‚Äôt.

Yeah because your comments have consistently made no sense and I literally wrote that to try and clarify what the hell you were trying to say  >And again, you‚Äôre taking this too seriously.

If you want to keep going with it, that‚Äôs fine.  I‚Äôm not spending my Saturday continuing the single most unimportant plot point of this movie.",1
Whedon watched it and kept wanting to film someone landing on Gal‚Äôs chest.,3
"Momoa, and Dave Bautista implies he saw it.",3
"Snyder could have easily disowned the film if he wanted to. But he had been kind and merciful to WB even after they fired him and shamelessly used his personal tragedy for their own narrative to hire Whedon. Snyder is still hopeful that WB releases his cut, but the higher-ups running the studio are absolute idiots. They didn't even agree to Todd Philips take on Joker at first, tried to allot less budget so that he quits, and co-produced the film which had a minuscule budget because scared of losses. They are absolute idiots.",3
Lindelof played coy.,2
"Nolan saw it,because he was EP and he has a great track record with DC movies James Wan Patty Jenkins",2
possibly the army of the dead cast,3
">Using what they could  Except they didn't. Only 40 minutes of Snyder-shot material remains and it's redubbed and regraded. A more respectable director wouldn't have rewritten 80 pages in the first place, Whedon did that. Not to mention a better director wouldn't have turned WW into a heartbroken sex joke like Whedon did.",3
I wonder if one of those people were Patty Jenkins or Christopher Nolan,3
Numerous execs Joss the other producers and writers you mentioned. Zack his family and friends including cast members Ben Jason etc for sure. Maybe not Henry by the sound of it...  Too many chefs in the kitchen panicking over bvs reception lead to the disastrous tc. If you watch something through negative and panicked lenses you will no don't find issues with story pacing numerous scenes etc,1
Momoa,1
"It's a shame that this tragedy happened.  Snyder's Justice League would have made $3.5 billion at the box office, at least.  And that's just domestic.    Leaving Endgame and the other Marvel trappings to gather dust.",0
"The same joke is in ""Reign of the Supermen"", Lex Luthor's bald head gets nestled between Lois Lane's bussom after she shoves him out of the way of Eraditcator's power blast",3
I can only imagine him snickering as he was writing it and filming it not being able to keep it in his pants. It did not serve the movie at all.,1
Omg who cares? It's a 1 second gag.,0
David Lindelof as well.,2
"That's a weird person to have seen it.  UNLESS, maybe he was being considered for Kilowog?",2
Bautista for sure,2
It crazy to me that there's over two hours of Snyder footage we haven't seen yet.,3
I think people would be more forgiving of Whedon if he didn't start to like and retweet tweets on Twitter including the bashing of justice League and telling people to watch Thor Ragnorok instead and also tweets which were digs at Snyder and other people who worked on the film. It's bad enough he turned these characters into a joke with his writing but this was cherry on the top of the cake for people to dislike Whedon.,3
Whedon and Johns hijacked the fuck out of that movie,3
"If Nolan was there, we'd have gotten the SC back in 2017. Nolan is a giant fan of Snyder's work.",3
"Patty?  Maaaybe, Wan yeah probably, but Nolan?  Nah",2
Are you high? Even I who have profound respect for Snyder‚Äôs vision know damn well after BvS that his JL would have flopped also. At least WB would have had the credit to stick with Zack and us fans who were there since MoS. Unfortunately people hate what they don‚Äôt understand.,3
Hahaha no way man but i do think it would have made maybe 20-30 mil extra. Plus the reshoots cost wb 35-40 mil I think that hurt them badly too,1
A ‚Äújoke‚Äù that‚Äôs in bad taste.,3
"That reply says more about you than you‚Äôd think, lol.",3
"I haven‚Äôt heard of anything that infers Bautista has seen Snyder‚Äôs cut.  What we know, is that he publicly supported it. He tweeted the hashtag.   It‚Äôs not weird at all because Dave is in Zack‚Äôs next movie. Army of the Dead.",3
"He‚Äôs starring in Snyder‚Äôs upcoming Netflix film.  Bautista seems like a pretty good guy.  I know this sub is hit or miss on following marvel news so in case you or someone reading this wasn‚Äôt aware, Bautista was very vocal in support of James Gunn when Disney fired him over those stupid tweets.  He straight up said he wouldn‚Äôt return to the role if Gunn isn‚Äôt directing.  So with that said, it wouldn‚Äôt shock me at all if the two of them bro‚Äôd out while working together no different than Momoa and Snyder did and he eventually got to see his cut.",1
"Not to mention his hate of Nolan. Yeah, they got a guy who considers TDK a movie with ""meh filmmaking"" to direct Batman.",3
Turned it to shit but still somehow making Snyder the sole person of blame. It's insane.,3
Wasn‚Äôt Johns writing before the reshoots?,1
I remember him saying Snyder did a good job with MoS. Did he give any other comments on his works?,2
"Oh true, Wan apparently actually saw it. Forgot about it. Some articles reported that after Aquaman",2
Not a fan of irony?,1
"""Knock, Knock""...",3
Haha! I didn't know people ACTUALLY thought that was good.,2
"Oh please, do tell.",0
Well that makes sense!,2
What? Whedon thinks of that of Nolan?,3
As if they actively tried to hire the worst possible guy.,2
No way!? Lol! Did he say that?.,2
"He helped frame the Superman's death scene in BvS. They both agreed that Superman should die at the end of the movie, but needed to frame how it would happen. Nolan played Devil's Advocate against the idea to help Snyder frame it in a way that wouldn't be insulting (Though obviously they didn't anticipate people just hating them for the idea). Ultimately they came up with how it was done, and **Nolan did agree Superman should die. I'm emphasizing this because there are people here who didn't read the full articles about that, only clickbait headlines, and who believe that they actually fought over the idea and that Nolan hated the idea. They use this as a way to create a narrative where Nolan was a victim to Snyder's ""dark depressing ideas"". In other words, people are crazy.**  It's generally known that Nolan (And most auteur directors in general, specifically James Cameron) are big fans of Snyder's unique style. Nolan chose Snyder to do MoS based on Watchmen and helped smooth over some producer snaffoos in BvS and generally seemed to like the movie.",3
‚ÄúTragic Irony or Poetic Justice‚Äù,1
It's the police ma'am. Your son's been hit by a drunk driver. He's dead.,3
Did I say it was good? No. I said it's a 1 second gag yet every rants about it for 2 years. Get over it.,0
He liked a tweet that bashed TDK,2
If Snyder was let go after MoS or BvS then JL might've ended up good.,2
> People blaming snyder are degenerates  I would get a temp ban for saying this about Snyder fans but sadly the law is one sided on this sub,0
"Thanks for the information.   >It's generally known that Nolan (And most auteur directors in general, specifically James Cameron) are big fans of Snyder's unique style.  Now I've read that, I remember I've seen some images on twiiter with quotes of other director about Snyder. This included Cameron, Aronofsky, and some others.",2
">He helped frame the Superman's death scene in BvS. They both agreed that Superman should die at the end of the movie  This is why neither Nolan nor Snyder was a good fit for Superman. ""Hey, you know what's a good idea? Killing off Superman in his SECOND film!""  Fuck, Nolan was also the guy who wanted Bruce Wayne to RETIRE at the end of TDKR. I'm beginning to think that Nolan just doesn't know any of these characters well.",0
"See, that‚Äôs funny.",3
Maybe if it wasn't filled with 1 sec gags every 2 minutes people would have not complained,2
"It's a point of controversy for fans. People like to laugh at it, and hail it as horrendous... I don't see a problem with this?. Maybe you may need to think about getting over it?, or ask yourself why this seems to be such an issue for you?.",0
The thing about it seems to be that it's a fairly low brow gag. And everyone wants to pretend they're high and mighty and above such icky things.,0
"Hes got nerve man, the guy fucked up AoU in the first 8mins imo.",2
It‚Äôs amazing how this Snyder cut movement has made Snyder blameless to everyone. Like the studio wasn‚Äôt arbitrarily wary of releasing a dark Justice League movie that‚Äôs 3 hours long for no reason. The reception of BvS made them think twice.,1
"I mean, WB wanted Superman to die in Nic Cages reboot in the 90's. And it would have happened in the first movie.",1
Lol attacking Nolan? That‚Äôs a paddlin‚Äô.,1
"Jesus, you realize that the Death of Superman isn't meant to stick right? The whole point of the comic arc was more the development of his character through his Rebirth. Not the death itself. Hell, by Death of Superman there were only 6 years of canon stories (Since Crisis rebooted him). Yes that's twice the time between MoS and BvS, but movies are always more compact than comics.     I guess Bruce passing the mantle to Terry is a misunderstanding as well then.",1
"I‚Äôll just reply to you and u/Ionlyeatvegans in this one reply.  If you find ‚Äúhumor‚Äù like that okay along with fart jokes or what have you, then by all means...that‚Äôs fine.   ^ and by all means, I‚Äôm just poking fun at that being ‚Äúhumor‚Äù by bringing up fart jokes as it‚Äôs all generalized to me as some childish jokes that should have died out already.  BUT ANYWAYS, it really has absolutely nothing to do with what you‚Äôd find as funny or not, but the situation the character is put in. Diana was portrayed as an incredibly strong woman through Zack and Patty, but the way Diana is used during the reshot material from Whedon, it just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. She‚Äôs basically objectified through Whedon‚Äôs film and it‚Äôs disrespectful, imo. One second gag or not, THAT is my problem. It‚Äôs more than just a one second gag when Diana is rewritten by someone that doesn‚Äôt and hasn‚Äôt understood Wonder Woman as clearly known if you read his WW treatment.",1
"for one, people saw that gag coming a mile away, hell, people predicted it. and for two, he already used that gag in AoU... i mean, cmon.",0
"Most people saw theatrical cut of BvS which is trash, that's what got reviews and didn't make box office. While not saying ultimate cut is pure perfection (but definitely a film i can get behind and actually enjoy) it's the movie people were meant to see and didn't. Thanks to WB again.... I think if studio would just let Zack do his thing, the results would be completely different. Oh and we got Doomsday also because of the studio, just btw....",2
"Yes, because the studio always makes *great* decisions. /s  (Also, this was the movie where Jon Peters didn't want Superman to fly or even be in his costume, right? And he also wanted a ""gay robot sidekick"" for Brainiac? Yeah, that movie was going to turn out *great.*)",1
"Oh no, I don't think Christopher Nolan is the best filmmaker of all time. Oh whatever shall you do.  *Momento*, *Inception*, and *The Dark Knight* were great, everything else ranges from ""okay"" to ""not good."" *The Dark Knight Rises* is a legitimately bad filming with *bad* pacing and *bad* writing.",0
"It's not supposed to stick in comics -- in movies, death usually sticks. See: Avengers: Endgame and Iron Man's death. *That* is how characters are supposed to die.  In comics, The Death of Superman was a marketing gimmick done at a time when ""superheroes come back to life"" wasn't much of a thing; just as well, the Death of Superman also came after *literal decades* of stories about Superman.  Meanwhile BVS was the second movie in the franchise and played up his death hugely, portraying him as a Christ metaphor. It was a terrible move that basically meant Justice League was hampered before it even happened.",0
"That was why I was mocking the idea of it. It was just so out of place. Just so forced. It wasn't endearing, and I get Barry is meant to be the naiive and awkward one. But it was just dumb. Wouldn't even call it a fart joke.",1
"That‚Äôs the thing. The first time WW, Batman and Superman are all on screen together can‚Äôt be some borderline R rated movie. It just can‚Äôt. If a director can‚Äôt make a quality theatrical release of a movie then, especially when they have the budget Snyder had, then they shouldn‚Äôt be at the helm",0
"Well that‚Äôs just like your opinion, man.",1
"Counterpoint: Coulson came back, Loki came back, T'Challa came back, all with less screentime than Supes between MoS and BvSUE.     If we're counting those decades of Pre-Crisis reboot stories, then we can count the Christopher Reeve movies, Returns, Adventures of Lois and Clark, George Reeve, Smallville, etc. 1950s to 2016. Let's say 60 years. Longer than from 1938 to 1993. That's literal decades as well.     Clark has been a Christ metaphor since the Donner movie. Mankiewitz literally calls his script a biblical allegory. Snyder had the guts to actually go through with it (Unlike Burton who choked). JL was always going to have the rebirth. It's the Classical Greek Hero's Journey. After a death there is a rebirth that inspires hope.",1
It woulda worked better if Flash hurt his head landing on her armor. Woulda mostly took the sexualization out of it.,1
"that's a fair thing to say, actually.",1
"> Coulson came back  In a TV show. In the movies, he's pretty much dead.  > Loki came back, T'Challa came back  They came back *in the same movie they ""died.""* If Superman showed up alive at the end of BVS, I would give you that, but he doesn't. (Unless you are referring to T'Challa coming back from being dust, but that's *everyone* coming back from being dust and they weren't really dead anyway.)  > If we're counting those decades of Pre-Crisis reboot stories, then we can count the Christopher Reeve movies, Returns, Adventures of Lois and Clark, George Reeve, Smallville, etc. 1950s to 2016. Let's say 60 years. Longer than from 1938 to 1993. That's literal decades as well.  See, the only way you win is by counting *all* the movies and TV shows. Which have *already* included the Death of Superman in them. Hell, when the cartoon *Justice League* did it, it *worked* because we *knew* this Superman. We don't actually *know* the DCEU Superman, because he's only been in one and a half movies before dying. When he dies, *I don't care.*  > Clark has been a Christ metaphor since the Donner movie  No, he hasn't. Not in any significant way. He was more of a Moses In The Bullrushes metaphor, a baby sent away to live on a foreign place (which makes sense as Seigel and Shuster were *Jewish*, not Christian). There have been occasional Christ-like references, but they've never been important.   Snyder, on the other hand, turned the Christ symbolism up to eleven because...uh...wait, because Lex thought he was the Devil. Or something. Lex's third grade philosophy lesson is terrible, too.",0
"Dude, Mankiewitz (Who wrote the Donner movie) literally calls his script a Jesus allegory. Singer was way more blatant with it than anyone. Hell, there's more Plato's *The Republic* symbolism in MoS and BvS than there is Christ metaphors.     If you count all the Superman stories released before Death of Superman INCLUDING Pre-Crisis stuff which is not only non-canon to Death of Superman, but was also a massively different characterization of Superman, then you can count every live action Superman for BvS. Otherwise, you can only count Post-Crisis stories.     Dude, we see the dirt rise from Clark's grave, we knew he was gonna come back. It's like the deaths in Infinity War, more important for how it changes the people around them than for the death itself. Not to mention, you say we don't know this Superman, I call BS. We've had an entire movie of getting to know him and seeing his struggle with his destiny, and we've had a whole movie about Clark's significance and how he deals with it. I agree with you with the TC of BvS, but in the UE I did care. I cared because this was a Clark I related to. Not some perfect being who just smiles and solves everything, a human being with complex emotions. I know more about this Clark than any other Superman in history besides Reeve. He's a hell of a lot more human than George or Dean. Hell, in many ways he reminds me of Weiling. Look, if you weren't invested enough in the movies to really see what this Clark was like, fine. You have the right to not be invested. But to claim that we don't know this Superman when clearly there's just as many people invested in this Superman as any other is just flat out wrong.",1
"> Dude, Mankiewitz (Who wrote the Donner movie) literally calls his script a Jesus allegory.  No, he doesn't. For one thing, he merely rewrote the script that they already *had*, cutting a bunch of stuff and rearranging it so that it would work as a film. For another, the only interview I can find where he mentions Christ symbolism is in the Jor-El scene -- he says he thought of it as an allusion to God sending Jesus to Earth. However, that's *one scene*. And he was *subtle* about it. (The rest of the film isn't a ""Jesus allegory."" That's silly.  (*Superman Returns*, on the other hand, wasn't and was terrible. Using that as evidence is like trying to use *Suicide Squad* as evidence that the DCEU makes well edited movies.)  > It's like the deaths in Infinity War, more important for how it changes the people around them than for the death itself.  Except we know and care about those characters a hell of a lot more than we've known about this Superman.  > Not to mention, you say we don't know this Superman, I call BS.  You can call BS all you like, Snyder's Superman is basically a blank slate. His big emotional scene at the end of MOS is gone by the next scene and never mentioned again. How did his father's death affect him? I have no idea. What about knowing he's an alien? Nope. Okay, but surely we understand why he likes Lois? Actually, *nope to that, too!*  > But to claim that we don't know this Superman when clearly there's just as many people invested in this Superman as any other is just flat out wrong.  It's not wrong. Snyder's Superman had one and a half films before he *died*. There's a reason BVS is so thoroughly criticized, especially for that ending (and for the numerous other missteps it had). Welling, Reeve, Cain -- they all had not just better movies/shows, but *better writing*. That's what it all comes down to -- the writing.",1
Snyder's superman films are a commentary on real world too...this is not a world that would unanimously accept this alien as a hero...his sacrifice is supposed to get nay-sayers to believe him as a saviour too...  https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/shuster_j.htm the comic creator said they based him on jesus and moses,1
"> Snyder's superman films are a commentary on real world too  They most certainly are not. Unless you think ""being slavishly devoted to Frank Miller"" is ""the real world.""",1
"JSA, so hot right now.",3
"Okay, but when will the Justice League be introduced?",3
Love it. Hopefully we get a Hawkman/Hawgirl and Doctor Fate movie. Stargirl appearance would be cool but we are getting a show in DC Universe,3
If you smell.,3
I think WB is really confident about Black Adams to put it against Avatar 2.,3
OH SHIT LET'S GOOOOOO,2
Looks like Grace Randolph was right. Her sources are getting more reliable,3
How do y‚Äôall think they‚Äôll incorporate them?,2
Could someone explain to a DC noob what the Justice Society is? Is it a proto Justice League?,2
N U T,1
Seems like a crowded movie.,1
"I expect downvotes, but I still wish that there was more rhyme and reason to the characters the DCEU was introducing. Still wish that there were crossover movies and an overarching plot arc in the manner of the MCU. Still wish that there was... just more of a sense of direction and purpose, you know? Between *Aquaman*, *Shazam!*, *Birds of Prey*, a Batman reboot, a Suicide Squad reboot, Black Adam, New Gods, Flashpoint, and a Trench spinoff among other things, it's hard not to get a sense that Warner Bros. is still just randomly throwing stuff at the wall and hoping that something will stick. At present, there's simply no sense that these individual works take place in the same setting or of a linear narrative spanning them, which makes me hesitant to regard the DCEU as a true shared universe.",0
I don't want to get excited for this yet but I don't not want to get excited for this now. Hope is like a Koi pond.,0
"JSA-themed restaurants are so now, so wow. It will be a miracle if we get in.",2
*ouch*,3
Hopefully when HBO Max drops.,3
Don't you mean the super seven?,3
I heard Dr Fate and Isis will be introduced in Black Adam.,2
Jumanji went up against Star Wars and became Sony's #1 movie ever (up to that point). I'm sure Black Adam could leg out like aquaman did.,3
Never underestimate the Rock's box office sales.,2
They've been pretty reliable for some time. It's just her interpretation of the info that I have a problem with sometimes. She takes way too negative spins on small things too often.,3
She definitely wasn‚Äôt the first to report this.   There were rumours as far back as March that the JSA was in the movie.   http://thathashtagshow.com/2019/03/08/exclusive-new-black-adam-script-features-hakwman-atom-smasher-and-stargirl/,2
She usually is reliable but this sub likes to REALLY dog on her for everything. I know she sometimes exaggerates her negative opinions but I still like her,1
This was said WAY before grace said it,1
"Hawkman, Hawkgirl and Doctor Fate as ancient egyptian heroes, with Fate being still Nabu (the spirit that will be later be in the helmet) cause Teth-Adam and Nabu were buddies at some point in the comics",3
"Essentially the Justice League but in the Golden Age. Includes people like Stargirl, Doctor Fate, Sandman, and the original Green Lantern Alan Scott.",3
Essentially the old school version of the Justice League.  Someone mentioned ‚ÄòGolden Age‚Äô and I wholeheartedly agree with that description.,2
You know how watchmen had the minutemen before them? Same thing,3
"The first superhero team on world technically. They have a speedster, wizard, lantern and etc, quite like JL. But I'd say they are not ""loveble"" like JL, I don't know if it's just me but still pretty exciting. (Except for Jay. I love Jay Garrick)",1
It's what the Minutemen is to Watchmen.,1
Not really JSA will mostly be supporting cast like how the Shazamily were to Billy.,1
"If things work out for the foreseeable future and movies like Black Adam, Suicide Squad, Aquaman 2, WW84, Shazam 2, and Batman (hopefully it‚Äôs still in the DCEU) are successful, then you can likely anticipate crossovers again.   Right now the move for them is to focus on their own little corners of the universe and get the ball rolling on telling good stories that General audiences can enjoy. When they do that, they can get a little more ambitious and do major crossovers again. Hopefully right this time.",3
Why do you want a MCU copy?? WB said that they are focusing on quality solo movies now and joker proved that just month ago. It is better to make exceptional solo movies than mediocre theme park movies,2
You mean the super friends?,1
I know. That‚Äôs why I hope it leads into their own movies,1
"The difference is that Star Wars is really popular in the west, it doesn't really play very well in asia. The Last Jedi also got a very mixed reception, especially among the fandom (not to disimiler to BvS). The Last Jedi's legs were awful for a Christmas release, in fact I think it has the worst legs for any major xmas release. Jumanji was the right film in the right place and the right time. The Greatest Showman also benefited massively.   Avatar on the otherhand was MASSIVE everywhere. Its also tricky to predict, was it a one hit wonder? I don't think it will be and I will never ever bet against Jim Cameron who delivered two of the greatest  sequels in the history of cinema.   Think about this little mind blowing stat, Endgame made over $100m in 4 countries, very impressive. Avatar did it in 9 countries and this was 10 years ago.  It also made $200m in China (4 times higher than any prior Hollywood movie) and was pulled from cinemas early because of its message and popularity. Btw when Avatar was released there was about 5,000 cinemas in China, today there are 60,000.  There is no way Avatar and Black Adam open together, WB will change that release date.",1
"Yeahh I get that, it can be too negative for my liking",1
Yeah exactly hence why I felt the need to comment she called this a while ago,1
I don‚Äôt think Hawkgirl will be used here. No trade or scooper has mentioned her. I‚Äôm thinking they may follow the JL cartoon and introduce a Thanagarian Hawkgirl in the present timeline and they have separate hero orgins .,3
Also ancient Starman.,1
Oh neat! I wonder how they'll be integrated into the DCEU? (‚òûÔæü„ÉÆÔæü)‚òû  Thanks!,2
Mate he doesn't know the difference between JSA and JL do you expect him to know watchmen and minutemen,3
"Just like early MCU did. Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and Captain America had almost nothing to do with each other aside from post credit scenes and led to a successful shared universe.",1
Isis: Revenge of Osama,1
"Avatar 2, is also supposed to have large sections underwater with some new tech and stuff. And, we all know how good Aquaman did. I think people are sleeping on Avatar 2, it's gonna make a shit ton of money.",1
"Oh yeah lmao, sorry I added her purely out of instinct since she‚Äôs usually paired with Hawkman and yeah I kinda grew up with the JL cartoon.   Yeah, I agree with u!",1
"That‚Äôs kind of a waste, since Hawkgirl is the far more popular character compared to Hawkman.",1
Maybe as a movie reference.,1
"I mean Watchmen was a pretty big movie that clearly sets up minutemen as a predecessor golden age team. JSA has only had a passing reference on the small screen with smallville a long ass time ago. So for mainstream movie going audience, the watchmen reference would probably be more likely to hit.",1
"Cameron is also a huge perfectionist, so those scenes are going to look photo real. Should be pretty stunning.    I kinda hope that it will have some influence on Aquaman 2.",1
How is it a waste if it‚Äôs a present-day Hawkgirl? It would‚Äôve been a waste if they showed her in the past and never mentioned her again. Unless they go the reincarnation route.,2
Wrong on the part of Smallville. JSA was actually in CW's Legends of Tomorrow which was a Arrowverse show and JSA had big moments.,1
But who knows if they‚Äôll do a present day Hawkgirl? As we know with DC planning isn‚Äôt their strongest trait.,0
Oh ya I forgot about legends of tomorrow. My bad.,1
"That‚Äôs such a broad statement. DC Comics aren‚Äôt the ones planning this, it‚Äôs the individual filmmakers. Let‚Äôs just let them make the films they wanna make and have them decide the characters that best fit the film.",1
WB*,1
Well it's easy to forget that show,1
Exactly why watchmen is a better reference,1
"Btw, sounds like the idea of ‚Äúshared universe‚Äù is still there and depending on reactions might come back in certain characters sooner than expected.",3
"Wooooooooo hell yeah though it was obvious. And don‚Äôt forget people it‚Äôs DC. Even if not in the current earth of the DCEU, that can change when Flash fucks up things.",3
"The actual quote:  > So first, because this is the same world as Shazam where everything is doing their own separate world. We have plans for our own version, we're starting to craft a DC universe there around Black Adam, Shazam and so forth and the plans for characters we have that are going to be introduced and so forth. Because ultimately we love the idea of a shared universe. I think the fans love the idea of a shared universe. They love seeing these characters interact. So we have very ambitious plans. How are we going to do that and orchestrate it and it's all in the works.",3
I‚Äôm more interested in when Shazam 2 will release,3

"It's nice to hear the words ""shared universe"" again and, more importantly, that there is an actual  plan for team up films. . The last time we heard something official from WB was that they are focusing on standalone film, so I think it's great news that shared films, even if it's just with characters in the ""magical"" DC part, are still in the picture.   Hopefully, they will do the same with Batman and his world.",2
"His comments are encouraging but it‚Äôs also worded a bit weird.  So someone help me out here: is he saying that they‚Äôre in the unofficially titled DCEU, or is he saying that they‚Äôre planning a sort of Shazam universe? Because the way he answered this question makes it seem like he‚Äôs talking specifically about the Shazam/Black Adam side of things.",2
Still curious if The Rock will have an accent for Black Adam,1
Is the script this advanced in development ? This is pretty solid details coming out.,1
"The poor DCEU. Batman is gone, so they can‚Äôt do another JL, and they‚Äôre rebooting Batman with a young, relatively fresh Bruce, compared to the older, experienced Batfleck. So they can‚Äôt just pretend he‚Äôs the same person and just continue JL. So do they reboot it? Or do they just let it be and not do another JL? Or do they pretend Batman retired and still do team ups like Shazam and Superman vs Black Adam? And then new Batman is just on his own in a different universe?",1
"THANK YOU FOR CONFIRMING. Jesus thats all it takes to dispel months worth of rumors in the future. Im tired of all of these ""X MOVIE ISN'T SET IN DCEU? IS IT DEAD?"" Blog posts and ppl believing in them.",1
naturally. Black Adam versus Billy Batson is likely a solid way for WB to make money,1
"Of coarse it was, they literally showed black Adam in the ""history lesson"" scene with billy before he gets his powers",1
Loving this hype so much above the usual material that has kept me from the sub. Glad to be back,1
"I think they are setting it up for multiple universes. They are making movies inside the classic DCEU, some movies are their own thing (Joker), and sounds like The Batman could potentially be in its own universe. I think it is fine that way.",1
Good! It's time to rebuild!,1
"God, I hope Black Adam has a wayyy better costume than Shazam.",0
"Forget who said it at WB/DC but i thought someone mentioned it was still all connected they were simply gonna be more loose with the mentions like how in Aquaman it's just a mention of the battle with Steppenwolf , Shazam it's just a few quick shots of items and the after credits scene.",3
Yeah they‚Äôre definitely trying to put some distance between the new stuff and the ‚ÄúPhase 1‚Äù stuff.,3
Shazam is in the DCEU and so is Black Adam.,1
"That's something I'm considering.  What if The Batman ends up being part of the DCEU because of Flash mucking up the timeline, allowing an in-universe and real-world reboot of things?",3
So their own shared Shazam universe.  The title is blatantly fake news.,1
">‚ÄúI can say that as far as I know, Black Adam is not going to be in the second Shazam!, because the idea is that they want to go and do a standalone Black Adam movie first,‚Äù  Sounds like it will be before Black Adam.",3
They better do it quick before they have to start digitally de-aging the kids.,1
"I hope Shazam 2  has more budget. The lightning felt really cheap.   It's Shazam we are talking about... the lightning was all cheap and mediocre, one of the most important powers of Shazam.",0
Probably a mixture of both. Shazam and Black Adam will be their own unique franchises but the films themselves will be set in the larger DC universe so there is room to expand.,2
I wouldn't count on it,2
Yeah I think so. Considering they're filming next summer. A finished draft should be completed or at least near completed. Plus Black Adam has been in development hell for so long.,1
It would‚Äôve been extremely stupid to make a Black Adam movie that isn‚Äôt in the same universe as Shazam. Especially considering the Black Adam easter egg.,1
That's how it always seemed intended and the consistent future movies coming out still clearly connected to the shared universe proved this.  Just a bunch of people here seem to think doomsaying cynicism is the same as being smarter than other people or something.,2
"Tbh I don‚Äôt want them to go full phase 3 with all the movies about Superman or Batman having 3-4 other JL characters. I want solo movies to be about the solo character. Just like they are doing now. And also, have team up movies too later.",3
"Well, that‚Äôs pretty easy for WB to explain if they want. Batman will eventually be at the shared universe. Not now, but he will. And when he does WB might not even care to explain why he is another actor. If a Flash movie has happened first then things can be explained by the fans easier.",1
"But Shazam is in the DCEU: The battle of Metropolis on the newspapers, the Batfleck batarangs, WW and Aquaman references...",2
Maybe it‚Äôll take the open April 2021 spot? WB did move Tom and Jerry which was originally going release there,3
It will be right after. Early 2022,1
Yup thats what i was thinking. Can't underestimate clickbait bloggers and trolls though.,1
A bunch of people here have a pipe dream that the specific DCEU movies they don‚Äôt like will somehow be rendered officially non canon despite all evidence to the contrary.,1
"Agreed seems like most want that very on the nose MCU oh look it's all connected shared universe. Remember that moment , remember this moment constantly instead of being focused on telling story.",1
Superman semi-cameo after the credits,1
"None of those things make it DCEU. Hell, Shazam's universe is earth version 4612854654545646546546565 where a version of those things or characters exists.  What a lucky coincidence that Cavill didn't have time to show his face, huh?  And most importantly, if Shazam is ""already"" DCEU, then why does Producer Hiram Garcia need to confirm it, as the title suggests? THINK ABOUT THIS CAREFULLY, LOL",0
I wonder how that movie us going to go. The Scoob! Trailer looked prerty good. I wonder if they are still gonna do the Hanna Barbara shared universe thing.,2
"He needed to confirm it because they asked him if the movie was isolated or connected to others. The last movie DC released was isolated from the DCEU.  The Rock was already cast as Black Adam when they were shooting Shazam yet the character appeared in an blurry hologram but didn't cameo.  I guess Black Adam doesn't take place in this universe either.  Seriously, you should summit your conspiracy theories to Alex Jones, I'm sure he will pay you good money.",1
"Having the exact same events in-universe make it an in-universe tie. They've made, literally, no mention of a multiverse so what are you even talking about? Your logic here reads like, ""they share the same events so they're definitely not connected."" You have some strange thinking here, bud.",1
"Why don't you take your head out of your ass and see what I'm really saying? Was I not hyperbolic enough? What eventS with a capital S is so clear in Shazam that you couldn't just ignore going forward? And if Matt Reeves' universe has references to other DC characters, that makes it a tie-in to DCEU because there's no mention of a multiverse? Critical thinking. Get some.",0
"Wow, I'm sorry you take this so personal.   Anyways, check out DC's Black Adam on December 22, 2021 to see the legendary antihero and The Justice Society of America for the first time in the DCEU!   Hopefully the Rock fulfils his wishes to fight Superman in a sequel! If only there was a Superman actor who recently confirmed that the cape was still on his closet and was represented by the Rock's agent....",1
"Gonna take a back a step here since you seem to want it spelled out for you, I'll try to keep it simple.  The defining connection is the magazine about the Black Zero event and the ""Superman is Back"" newspaper in Freddy's room.  We all know that Man of Steel is a reboot of Superman and the launch of a collective universe as was intended. The Black Zero event is, obviously, the main element here. It's tied to the opening of BvS after all.   In BvS, the Black Zero event and Zod are directly involved in the beginning of the story to set up the world around the characters. In that same movie, we have a photo of Wonder Woman that is shown from the first world war and then that is later expanded upon in the Wonder Woman movie effectively tying the three movies together into a single world.  Of course, after all of that, we get to Justice League. Say what you will about Justice League but the ""Superman is Back,"" headline on the newspaper in Freddy's room is a direct reference to him being resurrected within the Justice League movie. Naturally, we have a soft connectivity in Aquaman, whose very same logo is worn on one of Freddy's shirts, to Steppenwolf and the Justice League movie by Mera's comment to Arthur. Now we're four movies into a collected universe, however satisfying may you deem it. Then we get to Shazam.   All of these things being known prior to the movie, there is our Black Zero magazine cover and our ""Superman is Back,"" headline which are direct references to two out of the five movies (let's not forget the Superman reference and the Flash in Suicide Squad), effectively tying every single movie together into the same exact world.  Now I can imagine you may say that the newspaper headline is an allusion to Brandon Routh's Superman but, nay, the Black Zero event did not exist in his timeline, not like in Man of Steel anyhow and we know that Man of Steel is the jumping-off point. Each movie, up until this point, are now effectively tied.  I can see that you may try to diminish these facts simply because they weren't heavy-handed enough, as in-your-face, or whatever you may want to call it but that is not what matters. What matters is that all of these references actually tie and, naturally, they do for reasons stated above.   You may try to look at Superman's cameo or the lack of Henry Cavill's face as a reason why they're not tied but we must remember that the story is what's important, not the actor. If that were the case, then none of the Marvel movies are all that connected simply because Rhoadie is Don Cheadle, not Terrence Howard which is just an extremely weak argument. They could put anyone there and continue the story line, faces don't actually matter in storytelling so long as you're maintaining continuity of the world that was created which, so far, has happened.  As for your multiverse comment, it seems out of line because there's not a single mention of it existing even if it will in the future. Right now, it's speculation. It's a guess. It's founded on nothing except for you, as a fan, being familiar with DC but, if there's anything that's important about storytelling to understand, it's this: if it's not in the story, it's not there. It is the burden of the storyteller to tell you what the world is and how it has changed by the end of each story and, sadly for your take, it hasn't been mentioned even once so to say that it definitely exists is completely disingenuous. It's a personal desire, it's not a fact of the world created thus far. We can get into timelines and things like that a la BvS but, regardless, no multiverse. That's just not how storytelling works. So, when you try to tell me that just because it's not said, it must exist, that's just incorrect. Until it's established, you're guessing and we're talking about things that we already know, not what we want.  I'd be curious to know why you think that these movies are *not* within the same continuity after each of these movies have direct references to each other and after several people involved confirm their connectivity because people such as yourself felt the strange need to ask after the answer was already provided.   If your reasoning for them not being connected is because they didn't show you all of the sequences during the Shazam movie, then you may have an issue understanding the storytelling. It's not necessary to tell an entire story within a story in order to make it part of the world, just the important ties. This is all accomplished in Shazam. What it sounds like, to me, is that you don't like how it's not mentioned through every stage of the movie but, again, that's a personal trouble, not one of the story that's been created.  I predict you'll come back and have some kind of refute akin to your angry responses from before but facts are just facts. This is how the movies tie together. If you don't like the execution, well, that's on you but it's clear as day and you're just ignoring it because... well, I don't really know.  EDIT: ""Superman is Back"" not ""...Returns.""",1
"Damn, dude. Not only did you do nothing to further your statement or refute mine except regurgitate your own position in an angry fashion, but you decided to be a total jackass too. Must feel nice or something.",1
"Right, the person on the receiving end of a personal attack is taking it personal. Got it.  I'll be sure to check out Garcia's ""own version"" of a shared universe.  Hopefully WB reverses their decision to fire Cavill.",0
"Complete gibberish except for like two sentences, followed by some laughably predictive ad hom in attempt to avoid getting schooled. Writing more ostensibly doesn't mean you know more.  The only thing relevant is your second sentence. The rest is complete hogwash. And I already told you, WB can easily keep Shazam it's own world despite seeing glimpse of newspaper clippings and magazine covers. The fact that no character face is legible (e.g. Cavill) makes it that much easier. Mention of other DC characters mean they may exist in their world. Smart thing to do if you're leaving yourself a few outs for future crossovers, but they can just as well keep it to a Shazam universe.  There are two Alfreds, two Batmans, two or soon to be three Jokers. Why do you need mention of a multiverse to see that they exist in different universes? Hey I got an idea, how about just going with the fact that they just do? And if you happen to see easter eggs of other DC characters, how about thinking they exist in that world instead of implying connectivity to others? Sounds good to me. I'm pretty sure Reeves' Batman is its own universe. I'm pretty sure we'll see easter eggs of other DC characters too.  And finally, Shazam and BA may ultimately be in DCEU but Garcia didn't confirm that. If they were, it's because they always were. Which, again, repeating my OP, makes the title of this thread blatantly fake news.",0
"Ah, you have nothing left to say. Totally not surprised.",0
"Nice try, dude.",1
"We get it, you didn't watch the movies.",1
"Yeah, be safe. Stick with ad hom.",0
Lol look at you go,1
"Yep, nice and safe. Don't venture back to areas that are way over your head.",0
How many ‚ÄúDCEU should have been exactly like the MCU because deviating from that is bad‚Äù do we have to get on daily basis?,3
Yeah this is super boring. It's just you throwing titles at a screen.   If you're gonna build a cinematic universe then you need to map out how these movies fit together and why they're being made.   You don't even have plot details...just lists of villains...  PASS,2
We really need a pinned post every week where people can post these.,2
So...this again...,2
Oh boy here we go again. We've seen this so many times. If people are this dissatisfied looking back in hindsight maybe they should write fanfic instead. These posts aren't adding anything constructive.,1
"I know people are getting tired of these posts, but I love them! I think the DCEU had - and still has - huge potential that was never used. I'm making one of my own.",1
Idk. This is just my opinion,0
OK,0
> We really need a pinned post every week where people can post these.  I'll take it as a congratulate.,0
Anyways. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø,0
"I don't cosider this as fanfic. Well, at least what I'm doing and I'm going to show you soon.",1
"I support you bud,. If anything you can dm to me to talk about yours!! Oh ""dm"" it's for instagram. Heck",1
Same here. I'm scared to show my versions of the DCEU since people seem to hate them so much. But I honestly love seeing these.,1
Thanks bud. I'm here to help ;),1
"The movie only needs one improvement: an acknowledgement of the destruction and death in Metropolis after Superman kills Zod. The family he saves thanks him in his time of grief and Superman then goes to work digging out as many people as he can from the rubble while commentators shift between welcoming his help and condemning his presence.  Other than that, the movie's perfect as it is. Wouldn't change a thing.",2
"Zod has to die. Protecting Krypton is in his Blood, and with that purpose gone he just wants to die. The only thing that can kill him is Clark. So he forces Clark to kill him. It's more justified that depowering Zod and throwing him to his death with triumphant music in the background. As well, why does the movie need to be more brightly lit? It's a New York archetype city. You ever been to New York? It's dusty, and looks pretty much like the Metropolis we got. As well, Superman is on the first day and you just want people to automatically have hope from him? This is a world that went through 9/11, of course that's not gonna happen.     Superman does literally everything he can here. He saves the world, he puts human lives before the last remnants of his civilization, he actually allows himself to be vulnerable with Lois. What, do you want him to ignore the world-ending threat to save a cat from a tree or something?",2
"Man of steel was a perfect intro to DCEU. The ending was perfect, it needed to happen.",3
There's no way Zod was leaving Earth.,2
"The only way to make Man of Steel better would be to make it longer. I loved the first half or so when he's an adult but still hasn't discovered his true path in life...I got a real ""Superman Birthright"" vibe from it and I would've loved for it to be extended.  Also more Krypton.   Other than that it's perfect as is.",1
"I generally enjoy the film, plot and pacing is good, acting is good. But for me: get a script doctor for the dialog. Make Pa Kent a bit less morally ambiguous. Kill Pa Kent another way, Clark could've survived the tornado and saved the dog *without* using his powers so the scene is nonsensical. Add actual emotional weight to the collateral damage (ala BvS). Have Clark be more concerned with civilians. Don't have them kiss romantically and with a joke surrounded by 9/11 level destruction. Don't have a background character reveal Superman's name (one of the worst details in the movie). Probably more but that's most of it",1
"I'd probably only change Pa's death, I understand what they were trying to go for, that Pa would sacrifice himself so that Clark can decide to come out as Superman by himself, but I feel that it goes over most peoples head and it comes off as a bit ridiculous.   I feel the more traditional heart attack could have gotten this point across too, he could have raced him to hospital but at risk of revealing himself, and pa asks him not to.",1
"I prefer if Clark was a somewhat flawed character instead of a Mary Sue. MoS and the Superman scenes in BvS did it perfectly. He doesn't know if he should have a place in humanity but ends believing in his own humanity anyway from the advice of his adoptive mom, the priest and the ghost of his dad.",1
"You can‚Äôt make a great movie better, so I‚Äôm confused OP.",1
Wow bud. That's what I had in mind!,1
That would have the perfect set up for BvS.,1
"Ok. So, following your opinnion, if we want to see Superman as a hope figure, we should make him see the destruction he caused. Put a montage where after Zod's death, he goes throught the city helping the people, saving them from the bebris and that. That's the seed for a brighter Superman.",1
ok boomer. Only joking. I like you like the ending. It sets up a great future.,0
Agree 100%,1
Yeah. Agree with your ideas!!,1
"Oh okay. I see what do you wanna to get. In my take, Clark would save him form the Tornado, but in the way to get back to the refuge, Jonathan has an heart attack. This shows how Sups,  even with his powers, not always will be able to save everyone.",1
Something like that. That's pretty neat imo,1
"Man of Steel IS a great movie, but we can put on it a better take on the character of Superman.",0
"What would that change? All that would do is make the movie longer. That doesn't make Superman any brighter. AND SUPERMAN DIDN'T CAUSE THAT DESTRUCTION. The World Engine and Zod did. Zod was the one punching Supes through buildings and whatnot. Also, most of the city did evacuate and was fine.  Hell, we saw a bunch of that in BvSUE where he helps after the bombing and people still complain about him there. It will never be enough.  Look, Superman does need to end up brighter. But having a longer transitions isn't a bad thing. After Crisis rebooted everything in comics, Superman was quite morally conflicted. He only gained that optimism AFTER he died and came back. That's why All Star Superman worked, it was after years of him becoming that way. MoS is his first day on the job and your expecting him to suddenly be like Christopher Reeve who, may I remind you, spent 10 years in the Fortress learning from Jor-El.",2
A Superman that inspired a bully to be a friend and an enemy to be an ally throughout the film. I don‚Äôt see how you can get a ‚Äúbetter take‚Äù on Superman unless you really wanted him to save a cat perhaps before he saved the world.,1
Oh okay. That's a pretty good opinnion on MoS.,0
Pretty much that.,0
"Wait...you‚Äôre serious?! Lol, you need a moment where he saves a cat?",1
So you‚Äôre coming in with terrible ideas. Cool.,1
"hehehehe idk. Just put the seeds in, is all I want",1
Game recognizing game.,3
"So another example how professionals loved the movie , and pseudo critics tried to bash it ...   &#x200B;  Michael Man's Heat is definitely top 10 for me !",2
What I wouldn't give for Mann to direct a DC movie.,1
Michael Mann should definitely tackle a Deadshot or Deathstroke movie!!!,1
Difficult my ass,0
Critics are terrified that a comic book movie might win best picture,2
Deathstroke movie (in vain of Heat/Collateral),1
He could do Ralph and Sue Dibney as detectives!,1
"When your work is being connected to potential mass shootings and sh*t before it even reaches the theaters, it's not just ""difficult"", it's a goddamn nightmare.",3
"Nah, they'd be fine if a Marvel flick on Best Pic (do you remember the hard-on they had for Black Panther a few years back?)",1
Not the movies faults that Americans are extra sensitive and will do anything to blame something other than their guns as the reason for mass shootings,2
"ehh  The rest of the freakin world watched the movie too, and most of the them didn't have any such issues. This movie was gonna be successful anyway. I mean..it's THE JOKER.. obviously people were gonna watch this. It just exceeded expectations by crossing a billion.",0
">  I mean..it's THE JOKER.. obviously people were gonna watch this.  Well, there also happen to be a movie called Justice League. We all know what happened to that one.",2
"No, not really  JL was an ugly looking cheap CGI up the wazoo shitfest that had nothing going for it, no great reviews, it was short, it was following several movies that a lot of people either hated or weren‚Äôt overly impressed by.  Joker is a movie connected to the most famous comic book villain of all time starring a massively popular actor, and sold as a character drama/thriller inspired by Martin Scorsese‚Äôs movies.  Big difference.",1
Also no interference by the studio.,1
AKA Kevin,1
"There‚Äôs absolutely no need for JSA to be in this film. All they need is Hawkman, Doctor Fate, and Isis. Let‚Äôs see how this goes though.",3
It shaping up to be the biggest DC movie since Aquaman.,3
When did it get announced the JSA would be in Black Adam?  edit: nvm. literally the next thread haha,2
I hope that every character in the movie will have justice and will get enough time,2
"Probably going to mention how Fate and Hawkman are members of the JSA, maybe a scene of all of them at the end, when/if Adam is imprisoned",2
Either The JSA or Isis and Hawkman. All I hope is the storytelling is great and we root for the characters that are in the movie. I don't need another JL miss (character building wise)  Already devastated by BVS's somewhat bad reception and Josstice League.,1
Not gonna happen but it would be amazing,1
"I believe Dr Fate, Hawkman, Hawkgirl and Isis will all be in the film. However the JSA and characters like Stargirl will not appear.",1
It will be the craziest DC Comics movie ever made,1
Who‚Äôs Isis? The terrorist group?,0
"I hope Hawkman is played by John McLean and we get a scene at the end where he dives off the top of Nakatomi Towers and stops Hans Gruber from falling and then it turns out Hans Gruber was really the Sheriff Of Nottingham.    Then Hawkman hands Gruber over to Oliver Queen who says ‚Äúseriously guys I‚Äôm not Robin Hood‚Äù and Gruber is like ‚Äúthen why are you dressed like Peter Pan, Locksley?‚Äù and Shazam (who has been drinking Cola in the background) says ‚ÄúBurn!‚Äù  And then Will Smith lights up a cigar and says ‚ÄúWelcome to Earth.‚Äù  Cut to Black. ...  Obviously it would need to be an end-credit scene otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt make sense.",0
I hope that Johnson has taken some acting classes for this movie.,0
If anything Hawkman n Doctor Fate would probably just mention the JSA. But I‚Äôm definitely excited this will be happening. Always love Hawkman n Doctor Fate. Hopefully this leads to solo movies with future JSA movies,3
Gotta pump those #s up. Those are fuckin rookie #s.   Gotta Scorpion King style this bitch with big battles.,2
it's a female dc superhero.,3
"From The DC Comics Encyclopedia: ‚ÄúEgyptian Adrianna Tomaz was enslaved by intergang and gifted to Black Adam, the superpowered ruler of Kahndaq. Adam killed the criminals and set Adrianna free. Captivated by her courage, honesty, and desire for justice, Adam took her as his consort and gave her a mystic amulet that transformed her into the divinely empowered Isis.‚Äù",1
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they change the name,1
And this is why they can‚Äôt use her name anymore. It doesn‚Äôt bother me because she‚Äôs named after the Egyptian goddess,1
Are you joking?,1
He‚Äôs really not a bad actor. He just plays the same equally charismatic good guy character in literally everything he‚Äôs in. Fingers crossed this is the movie that really let‚Äôs him show off his range.,3
"Yeah, and no one cares if he's good or not. He makes a billion dollars, turns every garbage movie into a big blockbuster, right now is the biggest star in DC, not everyone needs to be Joaquin phoenix.",1
Yep in today‚Äôs PC not gonna fly expect a name change to Isla or something,1
They did on the Legends of Tomorrow TV series. She's called Zari in that.,1
That would be stupid.,0
"You're right, he's not a bad actor, he's a terrible actor.  I have zero faith on Johnson's ability to do Black Adam justice.",0
"The character is on Legends of Tomorrow, they just use her first name and she downs t have a superhero code name.",1
"Well, they're not getting another to replace him, like him or not. That part is a non-starter.",2
I don't see why they would change her name. literally an Egyptian goddess name way before the Islamic terrorist group,1
Okay?  What‚Äôs your point?,0
It sounds like your next move is a recast. I'm just saying it won't happen.,2
Charge your phone!!,3
I think we've won.   This confirms that WB following Zack is a new development too.,3
"I could be a pessimist and think that someone in the social media team is taking the piss...  HOWEVER  If WB really doesn't want to have anything to do with the Snyder Cut, wouldn't they advise their social media teams NOT TO interact with the SC movement whatsoever? Especially after the biggest social media event involving it just happened?",3
Someone said that this whole thing was planned by WB as viral marketing and at first I was like nah but now I think it's probably true.,3
The war is coming an end.,3
"If they release Snyder's cut when they launch their new streaming service... It will gain a lot of attention and popularity.  If the movie is anything like BvS extended cut, then I'm sure as hell the movie will be pretty good.",2
"Despite what anyone says, I am happy if Zack returns to WB in any capacity. It always warms the heart when disputing parties bury the hatchet and find a way to work together again. Now where's that Fury Road sequel, goddamnit?",2
So we were all fairly certain this was a marketing ploy. Now I don't think there is any disputing. Well done by HBO Max.,3
Plot twist: WB Release the Whedon cut. Aka the CGI free theatrical cut of JL with Henry‚Äôs glorious moustache!,3
hbomax employee getting fired,1
"FYI, liking an Instagram post is not the same as sending a DM.",3
"Thank god you outlined it with a big fat red circle, definately would have missed it otherwise. Jokes aside, cool news! üòäüëç",1
Don't listen to the heathens. Charge your phone whenever you want.,0
"Photoshopped, if you go on his page, HBO Max didn't ""Like"" the post. Also WBP's Twitter account has always followed Zack. Followers are shown by the most recent and he's all the way down by Emma Watson. The most recent follows by them are pages for their upcoming movies like The Way Back, BOP, Richard Jewell etc.",0
OMG it‚Äôs going to happen! üò∂üò∂üò∂,0
It's coming bois,0
SMH,0
This gives me anxiety.,3
"As hopeful as I am, and as excited as all these tidbits make me. I am still going to remain cautious until we get an official announcement from WB.",3
"I'm not sure about the Twitter follow, but HBO Max does seem telling.",3
I'm still certain it's a done deal and most of this is PR. It's massively cheaper to do something like this to generate interest than build and run a load of traditional marketing. If WB don't want to invest more than just finishing the cut then this is the best way to push it.,2
"> wouldn't they advise their social media teams NOT TO interact with the SC movement whatsoever?  Yeah, that was my thinking too.",3
"Yes, that is how a real corporation would go about a situation that has even the remotest chance of being ‚Äústicky‚Äù: a memo giving the directive of no interaction or comment on the thing in question.",0
I'm pretty confident they have been closely watching from the beginning. And once the right people were out of the way and the type kept building they took notice and started making moves to see if there was anything to this. But yes this was def carefully planned.   good on Zack. Justice will be served. Finally,3
I will be glad with whatever gets the Snyder cut released. I just want to see what he came up with.,1
"this is my opinion, remember 3 weeks ago when fabian wagner or junkie xl i forgot which one saying snyder ""representative"" goes to wb and has meeting for this issue. then someone create RTSC for people around the world to follow the twitt about #ReleaseSnydersCut.  not just that, jay oliva also said ""if you want wb exec listen to you this is the chance"" but someone from anti snyder blogger question about this but jay oliva said ""WB exec did use twitter and you think they didn't open their twitter especially in holiday (sunday 17 nov)?""  i assumed this meeting is about jason momoa met ann sarnoff, AT-T execs and toby emmerich to release snyder's cut but toby won't budge but ann sarnof ask if people really want it, show to us (wb exec) how many people who want through social media so jason momoa said yes if it hit more than certain amount of follows will snyders cut be released?  if they can make it  i don't know how many people should be follow RTSC twitter but they might ask around at least 500k follower and we got final result which is 780k follows",1
What shall we call the war once it is over?,1
And the goalposts will be changed. ‚ÄúWell it wasn‚Äôt done when JL first came out in November 2017‚Äù lol,1
snyder always those director that need longer cut to tell a story. i hope they release 214 minutes version,1
"this is what george miller said to indewire   **Are there are two ‚ÄúFury Road‚Äù sequels in the works?**¬†  There are two stories, both involving Mad Max, and also a Furiosa  story. We‚Äôre still solving, we‚Äôve got to play out the Warners thing, it  seems to be pretty clear that it‚Äôs going to happen.  **How did you get into this legal wrangle with Warner Bros. over ‚ÄúFury Road‚Äù?**  It all started because of the chaos at Warner Bros. and not Kevin  Tsujihara, it was pre all that. He wasn‚Äôt the antagonist, because a lot  of people didn‚Äôt know what was going on and were not prepared to make a  definitive stand; everybody was running around fearful, it seems,  through three regimes. It was hard to get anyone‚Äôs attention, so we went  to litigation. The chaos has stabilized and it‚Äôs become extremely  positive as the dust seems to have settled after \[the AT&T merger\].  &#x200B;  [source](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/george-miller-mad-max-fury-road-interview-best-action-movie-of-decade-furiosa-sequel-1202156053/)",2
Let's face it. Henry's moustache would make the movie 10x better.,3
Would love that too,2
Meant that more as a general sense in the whole RTSC convo,3
Man I saw the post.. they've liked it for sure ..,1
"you are wrong  though, WB did unfollow snyder back when they drop him from JL post production. twitter always save database so if which already they did follow again, twitter will put them at original list of follower",1
"I follow both WB profiles and they are under the ""Followers you know"" tab on Zack's twitter page. HBOMax just liked the post.",2
Well then you need to get your eyes checked bud.,1
"I meant strictly social media interaction.   But yes, if they wanted to shut this thing down, they would've by now, wouldn't they?",1
"That son of a bitch brought the war to us.... Two years ago... Jesus, count the fans... Thousands of people... What's next? Millions?",2
Der Snyder√∂k,2
They should just turn the thing into a mini series with like 4 episodes. I'm sure they can pull it off.,1
I support RTSC but yeah this title was a bit misleading,2
Misleading title.  Plus this has already been shared in here.,0
"Yeah, cause Zack followed them but they're not following him.",0
Bruh.  https://i.imgur.com/VjuS0KB.png,2
"Sorry bro, you're right. My mistake",2
You and I remember the dark knight trilogy very differently,3
except it doesnt look ANYTHING like the tumbler?,3
Can't say I see it...,3
Reaching....,3
"yes it appears to have wheels, just like the tumbler",3
It's like an N64 car.,2
Looks like something from Halo: Combat Evolved.,1
"Nah, I wasn't a big fan of the Tumbler, but there's absolutely *nothing* even remotely cool or aesthetic about that giant silver turd.",1
If the tumbler was like the 10th generation model and this was the prototype for the 1st generation model then I can see it lol,1
I see it. It doesn‚Äôt ACTUALLY look like the Tumbler but they share an aesthetic in that bulky post-modern geometric look. Not everyone likes it but aesthetic is judged subjectively. They welcome this sort of thing in Batman and Minority Report but they reject it in reality. I personally welcome it.,1
Looks like the car form the movie Upgrade.,1
It looks like a real life piece of shit,1
"This is a fucking, scalene triangle, 3D pixelated, PS1(X) graphics, minority report looking, moon rover azz cluster fuck.....  Shut up and take my money!!!!.",1
"What I meant by ""real life"" was if Batman were real and he were to drive a vehicle from our world, this would be it! It looks like a freakin' tank. It's bullet proof too. Same concept as the Tumbler.  I probably should have titled this ""is like"" instead of ""looks like"" lol.",0
LOL not at all^^ That‚Äôs kind of a slap into Nolan‚Äôs face :D,0
Have you seen any of the three films? Lol,0
Batman in the new PT Cruisermobile,0
Teslas advertising getting more disgusting by the minute,0
"[I don't think it's completely bulletproof, haha.](https://twitter.com/Pyrets1/status/1197734066683908097)",0
"lol no just the body was advertised as bulletproof, but that glass breaking was so cringy!",1
"...Why would there be a Thomas Wayne Flashpoint Batman? That's the one that indicates this is fake, also the BvS Steppenwolf didn't appear in Snyder's Cut at all.",3
"Yeah, this is 100% unverified. I'm a Hot Toys collector and this is tantamount to the ""my dad owns Microsoft"" claims of old. Things like his Twitter being located in Texas raises red flags, since Hot Toys are in Hong Kong. That's also ignoring the fact that this would be a massive line and out of the norm for Hot Toys, as they tend not to do villains that much. Steppenwolf would never have happened because he was in Batman v Superman for an extremely small amount of time, and they tend not to bank on large figures that aren't either proven sellers or extremely popular characters.   EDIT: Hot Toys probably won't touch another DCEU villain for a long while after how badly the Man of Steel line bombed. It's very likely they follow the pattern of their MCU lines and stick to the main characters. These types of leaks also generally originate from Weibo. Our first look at Endgame designs was in the form of censored shots leaked by a Hot Toys employee on Weibo. So yeah, no evidence for the Twitter op's claims, information is off, M.O. for leakers is off, and it's very unlikely given their precedent.",3
"To those calling fake, They would have recieved these designs in early 2016.  Green Lantern is a given   There is literally pre vis of BvS Steppenwolf floating on the internet (I know Zack later changed it   Flashpoint Batman could have very likely happened in a short time travel sequence with the Flash hinting towards his movie OR it's a case like the Suicide Squad Joker hot toy wearing a Batman costume - just done for fun.   Cyborg also has a lot of validity because his hot toy was flat out cancelled all together. The only league member without one.    So yes, all very possible. You people who dont collect these dont realise these figures often come out A YEAR or more after the movies release. They take forever to finalize.  He could very well be full of shit, but it's also all at least probable",2
I don't understand how some Random person comes out of no where with this random news and gets this much attention ... this is super odd to me.,2
"Ok, looks very fake",2
"""...but a guy on Twitter...""  Ok then.",1
"Someone asked when Superman would be released, he couldnt even give a straight answer to that.   Its bullshit. Dont believe everything you see on twitter without factual proof.",1
A lot of people are saying this is fake which very easily could be. That being said when you look at the line up other the big question over Flashpoint Batman it's not out of the realms of possibility these were the Hot Toys figures for JL1 and JL2.   Hell we know for sure there was Steppenwolf and Cyborg. Didn't Snyder say the Green Lantern would turn up at the end of JL1. Even if he didn't his appearance in JL2 would be quite fitting would it not? We know Darkseid was at the end of JL1 and was the main bad guy in JL2.,0
It‚Äôs definitely fake.,3
I don't know. It could very well be fake. If it was fake you think they would make it less wild though.   He mentioned that the designs came in in 2016 so it could easily be before WB wanted a softer Steppenwolf. Also who knows where JL 2 and 3 would have gone.,2
"Pretty sure when Flash was supposed to go back in time to warn Bruce about Superman he could have ran into Flashpoint Batman. And for Steppenwolf not being in the Snyder Cut?? He was too, Snyder has released pictures with him in it. He was also in BvS as a little teaser for JL.",2
"You do know that Thomas Wayne IS Flashpoint Batman, right?",0
Actually the pic that Snyder posted of Superman has the graphics underlay of Steppenwolf's original hand holding him in his pained resurrection. So he was going to appear in JL. But was changed some time after pre viz was done.,0
"I'm also a Hot Toys collectors. He say's he works for Sideshow not Hot Toys, he just has the information about them. It is completely unverified. No one is saying it isn't  Steppenwolf's design for BvS would obviously of carried over to Justice League where he was the main villain. For all we know the figure could have been close until WB changed the design.  Irrelevant of Man of Steel Hot Toys, the BvS Hot Toys were very successful were they not?  How many were there? 8? Don't you think in 2016 they would have had bigger plans until Justice League bombed?  I don't think it's out fo the question they would have Steppenwolf for JL1 and Darkseid for JL2.",0
"This is how I see it. Could be absolute rubbish, could be credible. I'm not willing to say definitely not when they're isn't enough information to justify it one way or the other.",2
"Because WB is hiding Snyder's cut and people want it and any information that comes out of the woodwork is jumped on. Doesn't mean any of it is true, doesn't mean it isn't either.",0
"It must be 100% false then, no matter what...",0
No one is saying he did. The guy is saying in 2016 they were given designs to create Hot Toys for JL 1 and JL2 for Warner Bros,1
I'm not saying I believe anything,1
"He meant the BvS Steppenwolf not being in Justice League. Warner asked him to ""lesson"" him and he did.",3
"The BvS Steppenwolf is different from the JL one. He was, I believe, ""darker & grittier.""",1
"I think he means that Flashpoint Thomas Wayne Batman wasn't going to even appear in JL do why make a toy?  But at the same time, we always get toys of Spider-Man driving around in some big ass truck whenever a new movie come out so who knows? Lol",2
"...Yeah? When did I indicate that he wasn't? All I'm saying is that he doesn't appear in Justice League (or the sequel as far as anyone knows &mdash; wasn't he going to appear in Flashpoint, Flash's movie?), so why have a figure of him?",0
That was Doomsday,2
"> It is completely unverified. No one is saying it isn't  Would you not say that posting it here lends credence to the idea that you're implying that? It's a baseless statement that has no proof whatsoever. I feel that posting any random, unsubstantiated Twitter comes across that way, especially when you're replying to comments doubting the authenticity of it saying why it may not be fake.   > Steppenwolf's design for BvS would obviously of carried over to Justice League where he was the main villain. For all we know the figure could have been close until WB changed the design.  [The Snyder Cut Steppenwolf design is the same as the theatre cut](https://screenrant.com/zack-snyder-steppenwolf-batman-v-superman-justice-league/). The op is positing that they'd have made a figure of Steppenwolf in the deleted communion scene. Regardless of which version of Justice League released, it was always going to be a different design. Ergo, the figure would have been of an extremely tiny appearance.   > Irrelevant of Man of Steel Hot Toys, the BvS Hot Toys were very successful were they not? How many were there? 7? Don't you think in 2016 they would have had bigger plans until Justice League bombed?  Aftermarket on the pre-Justice League figures are, for the most part, around or below stock in my experience. I'd also add that the Batman v Superman line had a single new character (Wonder Woman). The rest of the line was retreads of proven merchandising entities (Batman and Superman).   > I don't think it's out fo the question they would have Steppenwolf for JL1 and Darkseid for JL2.  R&D is substantially worse for figures with unique body types that only they can use once, or for a single character. They have to know or be confident that they'd be sellers. The DCEU did not have a track record for good selling villains (Zod) even prior to Justice League, and Hot Toys' precedent in other franchises (MCU) would lean more towards the side of caution in that department.  EDIT: Also, where did he say he works for Sideshow? He links to their manufacturers page on Hot Toys, but he doesn't say that he works for Sideshow in any of his tweets or replies from what I saw. I may be missing it, though.",2
"Okay my bad, I miss understood. That design in BvS was amazing though! Wish we got that!",1
Definitely:  [https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Before-and-after-Steppenwolf-concept-art-for-Justice-League.jpg](https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Before-and-after-Steppenwolf-concept-art-for-Justice-League.jpg),1
Doesn‚Äôt the video reference the Snyder Cut AND JL 2?,1
"Lol, yeah Spider-Man needs a quad bike for when he's tired of swinging",1
Because the video is not just about JL. It‚Äôs also about JL2! Do you read??,1
My bad but the original designs for steppenwolf were utilized for the previz - that much has already been proven.,1
"There's been many things posted about Snyder's movie, some have come true some haven't...yet. It's all up in the air I was just sharing it because if I didn't know about it I would like to. Hardly any of what I read can be verified at this point. It's just interesting. I even start my post with ""take this with a grain of salt"". I'm just not ready to slam my hand down and say it's not true because I don't know either way.  We don't know when Steppenwolf's design changed but it was after BvS. Most likely late 2016 or later. Why is it so hard to see why they wouldn't have got the designs for the new Justice League Steppenwolf until later on therefore in 2016 they were working with BvS design (which was going to be in JL) until he was changed.  There's a link to sideshow on his twitter page in the youtube video.",0
My title has it in too,1
"There's no evidence to indicate that he was in Justice League 2, either. No need to be an asshole.   Of all the things to be an asshole about, _this_ is what you pick?",0
There‚Äôs no evidence to indicate that he wasn‚Äôt. The entire point of this post is to serve as the potential evidence for Flashpoint Batman in JL 2.,0
The evidence is that Flashpoint was intended for Flash's solo movie. It was not intended for Justice League 2. Nothing Snyder has said about Justice League 2 has indicated Thomas Wayne's Batman would be in it. Why are you being contarian?,1
"So is the article clickbait or is there an answer of substance about the possibility. Because it'd be dope as hell if it did happen (and it was done well),  but I'm guessing the answer is just ""It'd be awesome if we did it!""",3
"It's basically what we knew already, but I really hope we get a Superman cameo at the end with Henry and it leads into MoS2",3
They definitely have something planned,2
"I really hope that The Rock uses his influence to nudge WB to keep Henry around for future movies. Under the same agent and the fact that the two are friends, he should be able to at least negotiate for it to happen.",3
"Funny enough, I can imagine the dynamic between Clark Kent and Teth-Adam being similar to Luke Hobbs and Dominic Toretto in the F&F franchise.  One's the straight arrow, stickler for the rules and won't stand for the shenanigans of this reckless renegade who does whatever he wants.  And even when they end up on better terms, they still rib each other.  ""I'll see you soon.""  ""...No, you won't.""",2
1. Have Superman cameo at the end of Black Adam.  2. Have ‚ÄúClark Kent‚Äù featured in Shazam 2.  3. Shazam and Superman be Black Adam.,2
"Yes PLEASE!!! That‚Äôs all I care about, Bering Henry back!",1
"ooo, that be awesome.",1
Henry will be Superman again.  He has to be. Plus Witcher will get his name in the spotlight again.,1
"""I think the DC Universe is a wonderful universe and we're open to everything,"" Garcia explained. ""We have big aspirations for it. We're friends with Henry. [Dwayne] and Henry are friends, it's a huge comic book brand as well. And I always just loved the idea. Who knows? But man, Black Adam for Superman is really cool. That'd be really powerful.""",3
I'd be down with this being Shazam 2   Like Shazam and Supes team up against the Rock before we get more teases of Mr. Mind (It makes sense since the Magic Realms are gonna be expensive as hell),1
Clark Kent as a reporter that‚Äôs doing a story on Shazam without ever being seen as Superman would be so fucking funny lmao.  Have billy completely oblivious to the fact that he‚Äôs Clark Kent and he‚Äôs mentioning ‚Äòbeing friends with Superman and knowing him so well‚Äô and Kent‚Äôs just sitting there writing his report with a shit eating grin while he‚Äôs interviewing him like ‚Äúthis little fucker has no idea‚Äù  Then when he finally tells him who he is Shazam feels like a dumbass. That would be priceless.,1
"Yeah, I'm aware. We've had these sorts of discussions since the ""The cape is in his closet"" comment last year. I was asking if there was anything more substantial than that.  \>, AND you pay Cavill like you do Dwayne WB.  Also this will NEVER happen, btw. There is a better chance of everyone in this thread here winning the lottery than Henry Cavill getting a salary on par with Dwayne's.",2
"Paying to Henry like Dwayne Johnson? Lol.how many movies henry played and how many movies he carried on by himself?U.N.C.L.E,Mission impossible and Man of Steel.the rest is either disappointing or flops.dwayne johnson on his own made rampage bankable,ff franchise,jumanji,pain and gain,san andreas etc. you can‚Äôt compare these guys.",1
WB won't pay Cavill what they pay Dwayne..,1
I feel like we're long overdue for a solo supes movie though. Maybe after a MoS2,1
Black Adam isn‚Äôt turning up in a Shazam movie until at least Shazam 3,1
This is brilliant. It fits perfectly for the film and would bring a nice comic (comedy) relief. This is why I feel that Shazam 2 is the perfect place for Henry Cavill and why he should have more screen time as Clark Kent so the audience can finally see that side of him.,1
I feel the Shazam crossover could help reinvigorate interest in Supes (Since the Box Office will kill it if it's at a good time with all these stars),2
Why do you say this,1
One of the things I was a little concerned with after Justice League... Clark Kent was buried. Everyone at the Daily Planet would know that. The world knows Superman was dead. Now they're BOTH back? How's he supposed to go back to being Clark Kent again?,1
"I saw other people say it, I think they said the order will go Shazam 2, black Adam, Shazam 3 wiht black Adam  It was either that or black Adam, Shazam 2, Shazam 3 with black Adam",1
That‚Äôs a very good question. It‚Äôs pretty hard to answer but maybe that‚Äôs why Snyder has Martian Manhunter in the film. He probably planned on doing the same thing like the Death of Superman animated movie.,1
I haven't seen that yet.,1
It‚Äôs cool. Check it out when you can,1
Oh my God. Zack you crazy motherfucker. This would have been the most epic series of superhero movies ever and WB fucking ruined it.,3
It's interesting how the things we often take for granted in this franchise came to be. Jenkins had the option to use or not use the WW theme Zimmer composed for BvS. Glad she embraced Guo Power!,3
We were ROBBED.,2
But no one in power had the backbone to wait and see the bigger picture.,2
"I love the collective ""OHHHHHHHHHH"" at 10:43, shows you right there Zack was on to something good that we were robbed of. I remember watching this live and falling asleep, being on the east coast, but I woke up and the stream was still live on my laptop and I caught this moment just in time. I literally had the same reaction as the fans lol",3
"We were robbed. That sounds like a movie I'd wait outside a movie theatre overnight for. Very frustrating.   Barry, if you're hearing this, I need you to mess with time again to make that timeline where this movie saw the light of day a reality, even it was part of the Dark Multiverse.",3
"""Darkseid boomtubes into the batcave and murders Lois"".....  I swear to god if we don't get the Snyder Cut I at least need to read this original script. Also a couple scenes with a ragtag group of JL survivors fighting in a post-apocalyptic world taken over by Darkseid? Sounds like some story beats taken right out of JLAs Rock of Ages.  We were fucking robbed.",3
"There's actually a secret photo that Zack showed to a select few fans at the SnyderCon, which was a different photo that they almost went with showing WW fighting an ancient war. I rewatched the video and it's what Zack describes in the video, both photos taken by Stephen Berkman of ArtCenter College of Design.  Edit2: I don't wanna create a false rumor. I just know because I talked to the people there. I don't actually know if it was new gods or old gods, but Ramesh did a [mockup](https://twitter.com/RameshDeSilva2/status/1143509228092477443/) of it, and maybe it'll come out sometime. Just be patient, it's up to the people that saw it to reveal it. Again, I dunno if I'm allowed to reveal this or not.",3
Man I'd love if they made these into novels,1
"Holy fuck. Why didn‚Äôt wb just fucking release these films. Such an epic saga, ruined for what?",2
"I just cant listen to this guy. He makes so many pauses while speaking, going back and fourth, correcting himself and repeating himself, stopping mid sentence. . So many filler words ""so"", ""right"", ""like"".",0
I would even say that her theme song is now as Iconic to her as the Williams theme song for Supes... but maybe that's just me.,3
"That moment when the Zack and the team was second guessing themselves, is where the studio should have backed them up and really support their director. The story he had was great and would have answered all of the bvs issues and give everyone one a ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù moment.   More credit to Zack I really like the direction he was heading.",2
If we someone more qualified overlooking the production of the DCEU we‚Äôd have gotten these films,1
If BvS performed well they would have. Even Zack said in the video he felt insecure about his ideas after seeing how BvS performed.,1
Wait.. WW with NEW GODS!?  SPILL YER BEANS!!!,3
"Yeah, it was mentioned that plans for WW weren't fully formed at that stage.",2
"Wait....those three goons behind WW, they're from For honor",1
there's plenty people like collider who has connection with wb for many years as free marketing and they with geoff john want cartoon version of live action rather than DCEU to be its own elseworlds stories.,1
"Weird, I have some problems with Zack but I like listening to him, he just seems down to earth.",1
Any director with a shred of good sense would question themselves with such a divisive result. But the fact that Snyder still had the confidence and the guts to follow through with his vision still speaks volume imo,1
"If you want some more hot tea, this guy on twt says he worked on hot toys for a lot of designs that are not in the theatrical cut and he's somewhat forthcoming.  Edit: nvm he doesn't seem that reliable and I don't wanna push rumors in this social economy.",2
"I don't wanna create a false rumor, it's been almost half a year since I was told about this so I don't remember exactly how they described it, but Ramesh tried to do a mockup of it: [https://twitter.com/RameshDeSilva2/status/1143509228092477443](https://twitter.com/RameshDeSilva2/status/1143509228092477443)[/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzIl0W_A7Sn/) Don't worry, we'll get to see it eventually at some point.",2
What happen when he put on the suit ?,3
"They picked him as soon as he put on the Batsuit?  If true, Robert might look super fucking cool or badass in the cowl",3
">He badgered Reeves  *Fire in the Batcave: Sources Say Pattinson Already Annoying Reeves, Recast Incoming?*",3
‚ÄûHaven‚Äôt done a big thing in ages‚Äú   Goes on to secure two blockbuster roles back to back.   You go Pattinson!,3
Best movie Batman incoming üòå,3
I'm so pumped for this! It's about time!!!,2
Gotta admire persistence.,2
So the early reports that Reeves had written the script with Robert in mind were inaccurate?,2
"> ‚ÄúEvery time I‚Äôve heavily prepared a scene, I go in and they‚Äôll say something like, ‚ÄòOh, by the way, it‚Äôs zero gravity.‚Äô""  That's hilarious! That's actually a good way to root out the bad actors though lol",1
He said in another interview that the whole feeling of having a mask on and the whole suit made him feel really different and changed his approach last minute,3
They hired him,3
I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a part 2 in this...,2
Bats descended upon the studio and lifted him up into the air accompanied by the sound of angels singing,1
[My sources say that he looks exactly like this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/cmx-images-prod/Item/366084/366084._SX1280_QL80_TTD_.jpg),3
"Matt Reeves and Robert Pattinson have a troubled relationship on the set of the upcoming DC Comics movie ""The Batman"", sources with knowledge of the situation have exclusively told Variety.  Pattinson reportedly bullied Reeves into casting him on the movie, which has led to tensions between the star and the director.  Sources also claim that Reeves might be considering recasting the Batman part with his original pick for the role, Kim Kardashian.",3
To be fair The Lighthouse probably felt like a small/niche movie while filming it,2
I always hope for the next Batman to be the best incarnation of the character. I hope he‚Äôs amazing!! I think Matt Reeves will do a fantastic movie.,3
I fucking hope so,1
They can have someone in mind when writing the role. It just depends if that person is interested or not.,3
"Yeah people would do that in a painfully over the top way, ugh, it‚Äôs making me cringe just thinking about it.",1
Have they mentioned which suit they used?,3
Yeah it's a full article:   [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-21/robert-pattinson-lighthouse-batman-oscars](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-21/robert-pattinson-lighthouse-batman-oscars),2
"If this ends up being true, sign me the hell up.",3
"Tbh this comicbook panel looks like Robert anyways lol.   I hope that your sources are legitimate, because this looks awesome.",3
I just want lenses.,2
Fuckin had me goin..,2
The other poster is most likely talking about The Batman and TENET.,3
"Kinda still is, I was in the theatre and 99% of the people in there (it was crowded as fuck) looked like film school students.",1
Especially since there both huge Batman fans!,3
"But why would Robert have to ""badger"" Matt Reeves to ""secure"" an audition (article's words, not mine) if they were already interested on him?  I'd imagine that if Robert really was Reeves' top pick and that he wrote the script with him in mind, they'd give him an audition or even hire him on the spot.  Or they would be the ones to approach Robert on the first place instead of the other way around.",3
Deadline news is trustworthy. I don't know why they have far less followers than THR,1
"Lol They didn't make anything up.    THR is reputable as hell. They were the ones that broke the story that kicked Tsujihara out of WB. They're a respectable trade, Deadline is just being salty.",1
"I believe I read it was the same one that Bale auditioned in, which I believe was Kilmer‚Äôs suit",3
Oh shit I didn‚Äôt know he was set for TENET,3
There might something really wrong to anyone who's not a Batman fan.,3
IIRC Matt didn't have a meeting with him until he finished the script.,1
"Because THR is a trade magazine. Same as Variety. They‚Äôre not infallible, but they‚Äôre incredibly reliable. They‚Äôre allowed to get a story wrong every once in a while.",1
I wonder how these guys fit in the same suit that (I assume) was form fitted to the original actor.,3
Wasn't it Clooney's?,0
Which aspect?,1
I read that Kilmer‚Äôs suit was chosen for Bale‚Äôs and Battinson‚Äôs auditions because it was the one that fit them best out of the options,3
I looked it up they are around the same height and considering they‚Äôd probably all be in typical professional actor shape they probably all could have fitted into Val Kilmer‚Äôs suit.,1
I sincerely doubt they‚Äôre putting on the nipple suit for auditions,1
Makes sense. Imagine Pattinson trying to fit into Afflecks suit lol,3
"Weird, considering we saw Cillian Murphy and Eon Bailey in that suit as well and they both have massively different shapes than Bale.  Side note: They released Eon Bailey‚Äôs audition, which was awful, but not Jake Gyllenhaal‚Äôs?",1
"dam so disappointed, would rather the cloth one for detective.",0
"Yeah my bad, in Batman Begins audition it looked like Clooney's",1
LOL. The duality of [Bat]man,2
Lmao Ben is a giant beast if a man,2
It was just for the audition. Pattinson said recently the new suit hasn't been designed yet but that Matt Reeves has the idea for it and that it's awesome.,3
Me too man! She looks the most Selina from the comics than any other actress we‚Äôve seen in the role. I can‚Äôt wait!,3
"I've never seen her in anything, and I'm starting to get concerned that almost every comment is about how she looks. I haven't seen many ""Oh, her acting was so amazing in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_...."" whatever movie or show type of comments. Almost every comment I've seen about her is either about how hot she is or how she will have the right look for this role.",3
"Homestly, I was kinda iffy about the whole race-swap thing but  looking at pictures of her I can totally see her as Catwoman",2
God damn she is fucking ugly.,0
"With Pattinson saying all of this ‚ÄúBatman isn‚Äôt a hero stuff‚Äù and the overt diversity casting, I predict this movie is going to blow more dicks than the fluffer for ‚ÄòBewitched‚Äô",0
"Her bone-structure is spot on to the comics, those cheek bones seems exactly how Jim Lee would draw her",3
"Is there something wrong with your eyesight? Selina Kyle is a white woman in comics, this lady is clearly not.",0
I think l  she has the acting chops too. If you watch Big Little Lies she was able to act alongside acting juggernauts,3
"She‚Äôs very good in the second season of Big Little Lies but tbh that‚Äôs pretty much it, her career‚Äôs been fairly unimpressive so far. I‚Äôm a fan but it‚Äôs because of potential more than anything.",1
"Catwoman has been black though! This race-swap thing keeps being brought up, even though Catwoman has been white, Latina, black, etc. in different portrayals.",2
There has literally been 2 black people casted. And 1 other one that‚Äôs probably only going to be in the film a maximum of 5 minutes if not 3.  This is what you call ‚Äúovert diversity casting‚Äù? Gtfo,3
Edgy...,3
"In an interview with Variety he further explained that he said that because Bruce doesn't see himself as one and doesn't think ""he's that great"" of a person sometimes.",1
Man are you drunk?,2
I can see very clearly and she‚Äôs the most comicbook accurate Selina Kyle ever.,3
Actually Selina is usually depicted as Latina.,3
Boo him! Boo this man!,1
"Big Little Lies* lol, but yeah she was great in it!",2
And a small but important role in Mad Max. I‚Äôve seen a few of her films or shows and she‚Äôs truly a great actress. Some people you can just tell they have it and a lot don‚Äôt,1
Because on account of how both Darrens were names ‚ÄòDick‚Äô..... but I guess for you Nu-Batman fans it would be ‚ÄúRick York‚Äù and ‚ÄúRick Sargent‚Äù,0
"Sorry, I forgot all of you guys are just fake fandom to push political agendas. For the initiated https://comicbook.com/dc/2018/10/16/dc-comics-nightwing-name-change-dick-grayson-ric-grayson/",1
Are you OK?,3
"I‚Äôm 100% team Snyder here. The combat scenes are incredible. Neck and neck with TDK trilogy for me, but the Snyder Batman is a fucking brawler and it rocks.",3
"Love them all, but BvS is my fav for action.",3
Tie for me...  The Dark Knight - Hong Kong extraction scene   Batman v Superman - Warehouse brawl   Both feel very Batman but in two distinctly different ways.,3
"Absolutely BvS, that warehouse scene is iconic in it's brutality.  Ben Affleck did a phenomenal job",3
Adam West,3
"Bruh.....  Batman in BvS is another league entirely when it comes to action. That said, The Dark Knight is still the best Batman film.",2
"Easily Afflecks.   I'm sorry but the hand-to-hand choreography in the Nolan films (minus TDKR) is borderline laughable at times. Feels kinda stiff and less fluid compared to Affleck, who leaps gracefully across the screen like he's from the Arkham games",2
Choreography - Ben Affleck  Storytelling - Christian Bale  Atmosphere/Setting - Christian Bale  Camera moving - Ben Affleck,3
"Warehouse scene is flashy, but I just love the Bane fight in the sewers. No music just the sound of two absolute beasts throwing haymakers.",3
The Honk Kong extraction was one of the best Batman sequence ever. So James Bondy.  Also the ICONIC chase sequence with Harvey Dent And Joker that sees the birth of a the Batpod.,3
"Id say, Snyder.    It's the closest thing to the comics. It feels heavy and gritty. At the same time challenging. Every punch feels like an impact.     Followed by the 60ies. They do it really well, for the campy universe it represents. It's ridiculous and hilarious at the same time. Just the fact that Batman many times use Robin as a weapon/prop is just the tip of the iceberg.     I like TDK trilogy, but the suit and the camera angles make the fights look like capoeira (or a stiff choreographed dance). He is just too stiff to make the fights believable..    Some are Ok, like the brawling with Bane. But many scenes, looks like the goons just stand there and wait to get punched.   Same problems with Burton's batman. The suit is too stiff for good action scenes.",2
I really love the first Batman vs Bane fight in TDKR. Something about seeing Batman get his ass kicked was so satisfying. But ultimately the warehouse scene wins.,3
This is a serious question? Obviously is Adam West's Batman.,3
BvS for me.  Batfleck all the way.,1
Obviously Adam West,1
"No matter the flaws in the writing in BvS, it had some of the greatest action ever seen in a comic book movie, let alone a Batman movie.",1
BvS. He was heavy hitting and brutal. You can almost feel those hits.,1
"As far as actual Batman melee it's got to be BvS warehouse. Action set piece overall goes to Nolan, I mean you cant beat the practical truck flipping and airplane crashing.",1
60s Batman is clearly the alpha among of all the fight scenes. Snyder comes nowhere close to achieving such realistic and intense fight scenes smh,1
Snyder did a great job copying Arkham game fighting style. About the only thing he did right in my opinion.,1
Batman fights as Batman only in BvS.,1
"That scene marked ""Batman"" is actually from Batman Returns.",1
I love the way Affleck's Batman moves you can tell he was trained by Ninjas. But I'm so nostalgic for how Keaton fights yes it's a bit stiff but idk I just love it.,1
How is this even a real question?,1
B v S by a country mile,1
"What's Batman without the sound effects??? '66 for me.   Just kidding, Warehouse takes the cake with Batman going Arkham trilogy on baddies' asses. Hong Kong takedown comes at 2nd place. When Lau was zipped out of the building by the skyhook, my theatre went wild.",1
**ZLONK!**,1
"Personally I think there's no one better who understood the fear that Batman gave, and the physicality of the Dark Knight, then Snyder",1
"BvS, no contest. I hate shaky camera fight scenes where you can't see what's going on.",1
"Fight, or action scenes? Because the best fight scenes are undoubtedly in BvS. The best action scenes, however, are still Nolan‚Äôs Batman for me. I don‚Äôt mind the sloppy fights as much and the vehicular action scenes are just breathtaking and haven‚Äôt been topped since, especially the whole chase that ends with the truck flip in TDK.",1
"BvS, Nolan's choreography was absolutely dogshit",1
"The action scenes in the Nolan films are honestly my least favorite Batman action period, except for maybe in Batman & Robin.  Kilmer's action in Forever beats Nolan's action in pretty much every way, West's action is also better told and shown than Nolan's action.  I'd probably rank it as  1. Affleck 2. Kilmer 3. Keaton 4. West 5. Clooney 6. Bale",1
Imagine adding Adam West's effects into BvS lol,1
Dark Knight Hong Kong extradition scene does it for me.,1
BvS is by far the best. It had possibly the best fights out of all superhero movies.,1
"The Dark Knight trilogy Batman. Aside from the warehouse scene, Batfleck didn't really shine in action scenes...",0
Cristian bale,1
Klonk,0
"I loved the TDK trilogy. But **most** of the fight scenes were absolutely horrible for me and my biggest criticism for the trilogy. It looks like a choreographed dance rather than an actual fight and none of the punches felt impactful (Hell, there's even a guy falling down for no reason in TDK:R). Except for the fight against Bane, that was brutal. Other than that, I disagree with you saying that Snyder goes neck on neck with the TDK trilogy. If Snyder is good at one thing, I guess we can all agree that that is action scenes.",3
How is it neck and neck with TDKTrilogy? Nolan‚Äôs films are amazing but the fight choreography was terrible.,2
Agree with you and I would like to add an honorable mention from TDK; Batman's first appearance in the parking garage. When Zimmer's score kicks in as Batman bends the barrel of the gun held by the imposter is pure movie gold for me.,1
"You can see the stunt double‚Äôs face a lot, but I fucking love that stuntman, his face is scary but I think he deserves an award for that scene.",1
Let's not even pretend any other Batman can do that surf scene that inspired Point Break,3
No one will even come close to the Batman v Shark fight. Lucky he had his trust Shark Repellant BatSpray.,3
look at all these loser Batmans who whenever they punch someone doesn‚Äôt flash  ‚ÄúBOP‚Äù or ‚ÄúPOW‚Äù on screen. What a bunch of chumps,2
## bruh üëåüëåüò§üò§üòùü§§,1
Yeah I totally agree with this,1
The cinematography in the DK trilogy is beautiful but the fight scenes aren‚Äôt shot particularly great.,1
Great call.,2
This is just one of those fights I watch over and over,2
Lol Honk Honk,1
"He specifically said which Batman, not which Batman movie.",1
"I don‚Äôt think he had the chance,I think the warehouse fight and the vs Superman was great..",2
True I still think the first Bane fight is the best Batman fight ever. The story the atmosphere the dialogue gave me a sense of dread for Batman that no other movie has achieved.,1
Oh I actually I like them equally is what I should‚Äôve said regardless of the action scenes haha. My bad,3
Yeah I can't stand how Bale fights it's like a boxer when he was trained by Ninjas makes no sense,3
Don‚Äôt forget that in TDKR the spinning punch bane hits Batman with doesn‚Äôt even come close to landing,1
I meant as a whole. My bad,1
"Wholeheartedly agree, just meant overall Affleck was outstanding.  When he punches a guy into the floor is pure Dark Knight Returns brutality and I love it.",1
Batman v Bomb is up there,1
"I want a West Open-World Arkham game so bad. If you stop and think about how much ridiculous fucking fun that would be, it's crazy.",2
"no, he's just satting that each portrayal was better at certain things than the other",1
"and put the titles of movies on the gifs. unless Ben Affleck played the character ""Batman v Superman""",1
Compare that to:  - The reveal at the docks - The subway fight - Hong Kong - The Tumblr Chase - The ferry conflict  - The batpod chase when he reemerges after 8 years - Batman vs Bane - The last hour in the Dark Knight Rises  Those action setpieces were bigger spectacles and felt more epic. The Zack Snyder Batman action scenes felt too small imo. Still a great Batman though...,1
I was disappointed in the chase sequence it started of good but then it got a bit messy and lost its flow.,0
"He was great in the movie, too bad the material was really dumb and not explored in any meaningful way",1
"At the very least, in the next Arkham game they should let you be able to select the West skin, and then whenever you punch someone the screen flashes ""POW"" or ""SWOOSH""",1
"Oh yeah,Bale has great action scenes.I think affleck is a close second though,Keaton‚Äôs Batman was way to clunky and Adam west‚Äôs were great campy action scenes,iconic to say,The BAM covering the screen will forever be parodied.",1
"My favorite bale fight is the Tumbler explosion in the dark knight, and the joker one is good too.Batman Begins definitely has the worst action out of the trilogy and The Dark knight Rises had epic spectacle",0
"Joker with the rocket launcher that batmobile,breaking,I love it.",1
Yeah the TDK chase scene is a classic to me was mentioning the dock chase from BVS.,1
I think that dock chase is just a hype machine for The big fight.,1
"Oh lord Jesus. 80 pages? For a shooting script, that's a lot.",3
"""Maybe try using some of my pages?"" - Chris Terrio",3
"So now we all definitely know(not that we didnt before) that all of the casts saying ""its still Zack's movie and Whedon is just completing his vision"" is just a sack of bullshit. 80 pages...holy crap and the movie still flopped to both hardcore and casual fans. WB really strong armed the cast to lie about this. Can't imagine how Zack felt. He got fired during a tragedy, a new director comes in who he thought would just complete his cut but ends up butchering his movie with lame jokes and irrelevant plot (obv not just Whedons fault).  Now I know why even Ben decided to support the Snydercut after all this time. They were basically lying through their teeth these past 2 years.",3
"Almost 80 minutes of Brunch jokes, Russian families and Batman being a bitch.  No thanks.",3
"The article isn‚Äôt clear about who wrote those pages, is it Whedon or Warner Bros (Geoff Johns, etc...) ?",3
"If anyone doesn't know, one page translates into one minute, usually.",3
"In a way I'm in awe of the ego of these people.   They seriously thought they could shoot nearly 80 pages in less than a month - the rule of thumb on large movies is they shoot an average of a page a day - with only Gal, Ray and Ben actually confirmed available and make it look good?!  Or maybe this is confirmation they just didn't care if it looked good.  Edit: Missed out Ray.",3
"The [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/movies/snyder-cut-gadot-affleck.html) reveals this background info for the first time, as far as we know:  >After screening Snyder‚Äôs rough cut of ‚ÄúJustice League‚Äù for a small group of filmmakers including the ‚ÄúStraight Outta Compton‚Äù screenwriter **Andrea Berloff**, the ‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù scribe **Allan Heinberg** and ‚ÄúThe Avengers‚Äù director **Joss Whedon**, Warner Bros. hired Whedon to helm a substantial round of reshoots that included ***almost 80 new script pages***. This version gave Gadot and ‚ÄúMan of Steel‚Äù holdovers Amy Adams and Diane Lane far more to do, significantly trimmed subplots involving the Flash and Cyborg (one character, a love interest for Miller played by Kiersey Clemons, was cut entirely) and added more jokes.  It's apparent that the post-production writer's meeting included Geoff Johns, Jon Berg, Toby Emmerich, Joss Whedon, Andrea Berloff, Allan Heinberg, and [this video](https://youtu.be/m4b_4GLPQvs) also names Seth Grahame-Smith (who was briefly signed on to direct The Flash solo movie but [left the project](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/flash-movie-loses-director-888994) due to ""creative differences""). For the first time, we know that Joss Whedon wrote almost 80 pages of rewrites (in scripts, 1 page = 1 minute), which means, out of the 1 hour 59 minute runtime of Justice League, probably only about 40 minutes of Zack's version (33% of the theatrical cut) made it through untouched to the theatrical cut (which means audiences only saw 20% of the 214 min Snyder cut so far).  [Patty Jenkins liked a tweet of an article announcing Joss's departure from Batgirl](https://twitter.com/BatmanNewsCom/status/967477981554847746), and she didn't bring back Allan Heinberg as a writer for Wonder Woman 1984, possibly because of his involvement with Joss, so that was smart of Patty. I believe she is still loyal to Zack, as is James Wan, who showed Zack [an early preview of Aquaman](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/ac418a/article_aquaman_got_thumbs_up_from_zack_snyder/) despite the studio's objections. Zack Snyder is [still a producer on Wonder Woman 1984](https://batman-news.com/2018/06/13/wonder-woman-1984-press-release-reveals-zack-snyder-gal-gadot-as-producers-and-more/), and obviously Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, and Ray Fisher are loyal to Zack in standing with him.  Diane Nelson, former president of DC Entertainment, said ""\[Geoff Johns\] [is no buddy of mine.](https://i.imgur.com/D9A7WNl.png)"" and she tweeted out ""[\#ReleaseTheSnyderCut](https://twitter.com/dewnelson1/status/1196227881019432960)"".  Warner Bros following Zack again on twitter is a nice development.",3
i believe one of the early rumors was that it was a completely new movie with only the action scenes repurposed... seems like tiw as true,2
"Hahahahaha....  Release the SC, please!",3
We really went from Chris Terrio to Joss Whedon uh,3
"WB (and Geoff) were......pretty fucking dumb to think that they could make this work and Joss was arrogant enough to think he could do it.  Some movies can pull it off depending on scale and how much, like a World War Z or Rogue One, but to change the whole film from tone to script...I mean....well you end up with a film like Solo (sorry Solo fans) which felt dull, uninspired and color by numbers.  But.....even if we do get the Snyder cut so much of it was truncated and changed in production it will likely still feel off kilter.",3
Thanks Joss and WB for destroying JL,3
Run me my fucking movie man.,3
"Lot of folks act like people shouldn't be hard on Joss but I think this community should bet disgusted. Sounds valiant to help out a colleague in the face of tragedy but everything he did feels slimy and narcissistic. If peter Jackson left during Return of the King and they brought in Michael Bay to ""finish"" the movie but instead dude decided to shorten the movie and make it ""flow"" better by adding 20 explosion. I have to believe that the artistic world would look down upon Bay in that situation. Kinda like some tattoo artist wont touch another artists work. I get that joss didnt have enough time, but why did he think he did? Did he think he was going to be the DC savior by pumping out a bland Saturday morning cartoon? Even the DC animated stuff is heavier than anything Joss has done. If I was already a billion dollar director I think I would be looking for my own project anyway. Narcissist for sure.",3
"My view on Whedon has dramatically softened. If it wasn‚Äôt him, it would have been someone else. Maybe he thought he could retain enough of Zack‚Äôs vision while incorporating the new elements WB wanted.",2
What font size was he using to make it 80 pages?,2
"If 80 pages mean 80 minutes, then that's 2/3s of the movie being complete shit, which drags whatever good in it down to being shit.",1
80 pages amounts to like 60% of the final cut,1
"He shouldn't be allowed to go anywhere near DC movies, shows and anything else DC.",2
So like 80%?,2
Wheeeeeeedddoooooooooooooon https://giphy.com/explore/the-wrath-of-khan,1
"People are acting like this means that only 40 minutes of Zack's footage was used...  So here's my question: Is there any proof that all nearly-80 pages were both shot and used in the theatrical cut of JL? It has been confirmed that at least a few Whedon reshoots have been deleted from certain leaks.   I vaguely remember someone on this sub saying that a total of ~66 minutes of Snyder footage was used, or 55% of the final cut of the movie. So maybe not all of these 80 pages were used?",1
So that's like 80 minutes worth of script right?  How much of that was even used? (Cause I remember hearing even Whedon got a ton of shit cut),1
That's a big roll of toilet paper.,1
40 of those pages were quips and comedy gags,1
"It seems unlikely they used only 40 mins of Snyder‚Äôs footage. If memory serves me right, guild rules state that if a director is given credit, then 51% of his footage should be used (hence why they pretty much reshot solo to remove lord miller from the credits). At 120 mins of runtime, whedon would have gotten 60 mins in tops.",1
"Man, I hate him",0
Yeah! Let's see that Joss Whedon director's cut of Justice League!,0
Yea Joss you can go suck one.,1
RTWC,0
Wheaton was brought in because Zach Snyder‚Äôs cut was a mess.,0
I believe thats 80 minutes of screen time as well. Seems like there was still more,3
Each page is usually a minute so that‚Äôs almost an hour an a half of new footage,1
üò¢ Chris Terrio's original pre-Johns script is something I'd kill to read,3
See that rumor has me worried. Terrio must've not been happy that they weren't using allot of his script during principal photography so that means John's was probably rewriting parts of it on the fly. I'm really curious to see what Zack ended up shooting.,3
Has Chris come out recently to support the snyder cut at all? Just curious,2
"Yeah, this is such a huge vindication for Zack.  I'm of the opinion that I'm going to very much like the Director Cut of JL, but even if some absolutely hate it, at least it would be Zack's product. He's spent 2 years, after the suicide of one of his kids, being blamed by the general audience for a movie that he had very little hand in, in the end.",3
"I mean the stars really have no option other than to lie unless their contracts are torn up. If they speak out, odds are they get blacklisted and never cast in anything major ever again by any studio. Hollywood is a surprisingly small world.",1
"Wasn't Whedon brought in because ZS couldn't finish it? When did he get ""fired""?",0
And how THIRSTY Lois is.,1
I feel attacked. I liked the brunch jokes.,0
Yeah could you imagine how stupid BvS would have been if Whedon had wrote it? He‚Äôd probably have Luther put a jar of piss on a desk or feed M&Ms into a general‚Äôs mouth.,0
"It just said ""Written by anyone but Chris Terrio""",3
"Right, didn't terrio complain that John's kept rewriting his original script",3
"The source is the NYT article which says ""Warner Bros. hired Whedon to helm a substantial round of reshoots that included ***almost 80 new script pages***.""",2
Yup. And by assumption that means only 40 mins approx of Zacks footage was used in the final film.,3
"Wait, *where* was there more for Amy Adams and Diane Lane to do?   They replaced one Lois & Martha interaction for another, cut most of the Clark & Martha interaction (going by what Cavill said happened after Clark's return),  and completely removed Lois' agency - being brought by Bruce instead of running to the park.",3
"Why must everybody in the dceu kiss zack snyder's ring? like seriously wtf.   Also by your logic Patty Jenkins didn't bring back Alan heinberg for ww1984 because he was a snake for his involvement with joss, instead, she brought back Geoff Johns who was also in the meeting with joss, and was involved in JL, to write the screenplay for ww1984 with her ?????? make it make sense.   Can you guys stop with the unsubstantiated conspiracy theories??????",0
"I haven't seen Solo, would you say it's worse than JL or better?",1
"I REALLY think Geoff Johns played a major, major part in this (yes I know he falls under ""WB"" at that time, but still...). I still don't think he's happily landed after what transpired and I wouldn't be surprised for his involvement with DC to lessen even more in wake of the merger, the seemingly-likely release of the SC, and the incredible delays in all his current comic work.   And I say that as a big fan of Doomsday Clock.",3
"Yes blame Joss, but remember to support the wonderful Warner Brother's studio at their next movie!",1
"I‚Äôm not in Whedon‚Äôs Head, but it does seem like there was a known, understood quid pro quo going on here.    In other words, ‚ÄúIf you help us out on this Joss, the Batgirl project is all yours, buddy‚Äù.    That shit happens a lot in Jollywood, I‚Äôm guessing. People fucking over (and sometimes actually fucking) others just to make a deal, get a foot in the door, buddy up with the right decision makers, etc.",3
"Lol...Whedon didn't decide anything. WB gave him their directives and he stuck to them. A hired on director doesn't dictate runtime, dude. Come on....",3
"Than anything Joss has done? I‚Äôm no fan of what he did to Justice League, but insulting Firefly is not ok.",1
" >If peter Jackson left during Return of the King and they brought in Michael Bay to ""finish"" the movie but instead dude decided to shorten the movie and make it ""flow"" better by adding 20 explosion.  And firing Howard Shore and having Randy Newman compose a new soundtrack.",1
"Agreed, and this is the crucial issue that whedon bashers seem to be missing. Not to forget that WB edited out whedon‚Äôs footage as well.  This is going to be an unpopular opinion,but the way I see it, it really seems like whedon tried to retain the major beats of the Snyder cut, albeit butchered big time by the suits. What we lost (admittedly good stuff) were character development scenes, connections to Darkseid and potentially evil superman as a brief plot point(which is again up in the air). I highly doubt the movie would have ended on a cliffhanger with the Injustice storyline like it was rumoured (that version is probably the ‚Äòscary‚Äô version of the film which Snyder stated they never shot).",1
"You should blame the corporate guys freaking out after Snyder's initial principal photography, so they hired Whedon to make it more Avengers-y, can't blame Whedon fully for doing his job.",3
"This isn't Whedon's fault man, if it wasn't him WB would've just got the next guy on the list. You should be angry at WB and showing it, instead of everyone throwing all their money at every DC movie and begging for Zack's cut to be released. Ya'll should be boycotting WB films if you really cared about Zack's vision.",3
"80 pages were definitely not used in the theatrical cut. The actor who fought Batman at the start said Joss was disappointed WB made him cut some of that stuff so I expect there was much more cut. Especially as 80 pages is roughly 80 minutes of screentime.  I'm wouldn't be surprised if they filmed the most of the 80 pages though, because the footage looks like they didn't have any time to light it properly and were just rushing through the work.",2
Isn‚Äôt Joss‚Äôs writing also famously dialogue heavy? that‚Äôs gonna boost page count right?,2
"They didn't use all the scenes Whedon shot, either.  Additionally, a lot of what they kept from Snyder was re-edited and changed visually (effects and color timing), so even if technically shot under Snyder's direction it was also altered. Look at the differences in the final battle against Steppenwolf as compared to the first SDCC for several examples.",1
"""Man I hate Joss!!"" *throws all my money at Warner Brothers anytime a new comic book movie is out*",1
For doing his job?,2
"They did, 17.11.2017",2
so you already watch it? at this point josstice league is the worst product for DCEU,1
That‚Äôs some good math,3
About right. Shooting scripts are only around 100 pages usually. The only difference I can think of is the original Superman 1 script was about 500 pages. And Mankiewitz was literally called in to shorten it.,3
Chris Terrio did a prize give-away for fans finding the best easter egg and [references in BvS](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/8gf07o/discussion_zack_snyder_says_it_was_an_honor_to_go/). He's still supportive of Zack.,3
I don't think he has social media. Maybe he'll get asked on the TROS press tour?,1
Dont think anyone really blamed Snyder for the outcome of the movie itself.  Just how his previous offerings really set the entire venture back and led to the Studio Execs to panic and meddle instead of staying put or pulling the plug and taking more time to fix things.  I dont have faith that a Snyder cut would be good even (something led to them wanting to meddle like they did) but if it's something easy to fix together then getting the Snyder cut out would at least be a fair bit of closure for those who were enjoying it and worked on it.  The reshoots had the damming effect of pissing off the loyal fans who did appreciate their vision.  Changing half-assedly towards appeasing fans like me who were turned off by the original vision without delaying the film was just a terrible idea anyway.,2
"I really don't understand this affectionate martyrdom of zack snyder. Dude was paid millions of dollars for JL. I'm really sorry his kid died truly i am, i would have been more pissed if he wasn't paid for BVS OR JL.  But he was, i dont really see him as a victim, he is a millionaire for fuck sake. If he really want to fulfill his ""VISION"".  He could release a series of comics on his 5 part movie arc he had planned. Its really fucking simple. WB is a business and DC belongs to WB. DC doesn't belong to Zack Snyder. He was hired to do a job, his bosses felt he wasn't good enough and he was fired simple!!. It happens everyday, that is the nature of capitalism.",0
"Oh man, you‚Äôve got about 2 years of catch-up to do.  Sounds like the most recent info you‚Äôve got dates back to before the ‚ÄúHeroes‚Äù Trailer even released, lol.",2
He didn't.  His daughter killed herself so Snyder decided to take a step back and WB brought in Whedon to complete the movie.,2
Then you will die braver than most!,3
"Same (I actually didn't mind the family either, just feel they could have been incorporated better)",1
"I'll take 20 jars of piss over Flash falling into Diana's chest, the Super monstrosity, Diana being reduced to Steve Trevor's widow and The Batman acting like a 10 year old any day.",3
The jar of piss joke is infinitely better than anything Whedon wrote for this movie,3
"LMAO...feelings on jokes aside, you can't deny that Whedon put together a couple of really good ensemble films with the first two Avengers flicks.",2
What wrong with these scenes? They're fucking great.,1
I hated that jar of piss scene more than anything in JL,0
"40 minutes of horribly colour graded, regressively scored, cheaply edited garbage.",3
"nope, according to people who watch test screening in kevin smith video, she go there herself without batman nor alfred around. remember in trailer where lois heard something and she suddenly turned around to look what that sound? she actually investigate missing star lab employee",1
"Better, it's boring but watchable.",2
Much better. I can have fun with solo. And the reshoots aren‚Äôt easy to see,2
"I gave Solo a 4/10 and even that was still infinitely better than JL.  They went from MoS to BvS and suddenly they're all there with a Superman reincarnate. Just beyond stupid.   They should have done MoS 2.   They're doing well after Snyder, and now they put their energy into breaking it again, reminding us of the bad narrative instead of maintaining their good streak.",0
"I think Johns screwed up and is paying the price. They gave him GL to write, and it's been years with no updates. It's still listed on his site but at this point I don't think he's involved anymore. Especially now they we're getting a GL show and he has no involvement in it.",2
Geoff Johns was in way over his head. His first movie as a studio executive and he whiffed it so hard he‚Äôs now relegated to producing shows for the DC app,2
The key players involved in this film have all been either replaced or demoted,1
"new management under new company, where did you stay in this past 5 months?",1
"Doesn't really seem like anyone knows who to blame creative decisions on. But I dont think Whedon signed on for a couple shots only for WB to crack the whip and force joss into a bunch of bad decisions. If he had tegridy, he would of stepped back when being presented this 80 page script. As I said, narcissist looking to save the day seems more likely. And maybe if this was some junior director getting his chance with some huge IP it may be forgivable. But this is the equivalent of Ed Hardy doodling on a Van Gogh.",1
Whedon didn't have to say yes to something as shady as coming in to completely change someone's film.,1
You got me. Firefly was great. But that's also cause my guy nathan dillion is a national treasure.,1
"disagree, although i not blame him 100% but he still agree to change the whole script rather than simplified terrio script. i blame more towards geoff john who try to be kevin feigi because he is responsible to not wait zack to release his movie, after that john can do whatever he want.  &#x200B;  whedon also make batman tsundere character which opposite of batman is.",1
"But I think you CAN blame Whedon just on a general ethics level.  Maybe more so from a ‚Äúfellow creative person‚Äù level.   And this is aside from whatever anger as a Snyder/DCEU fan I have over the end product.    I‚Äôm looking at it from the angle of knowing that a fellow director was done dirty and viewing it opportunistically as the chance to get in good with all the right people at the studio and attain that big money contract to do a Batgirl film.   I mean, don‚Äôt you think there‚Äôs a reason WB went with their cover story that portrayed it as Whedon doing a big favor for everybody and help shepherd the film through the final lap with some minor touches while Snyder worked thru a personal tragedy?   Sure sounds a lot better than ‚ÄúMercenary hack fraud douchebag saw college student‚Äôs suicide as his big chance. Will help us take a wrecking ball to Justice League in exchange for writing credit and contract to direct Batgirl‚Äù.",2
"Yeah I'm not a fan of Whedon generally but this isn't really on him. It was a work for hire role, the producers were always going to dictate what they wanted.  Sure we can blame Joss for some of the dumb stuff he personally added. But the overall product of the film lays squarely at the feet of 2017 WB.",2
"I still can't see WB execs asking Whedon to specifically include boob jokes and ass shots. I guess they gave him a general idea of what needing adjustements (in their minds at least), but HE chose to go with this shitty content.   That's how I picture it at least.",2
"I disagree. Say we got someone like Abrams to  write and direct the reshoots, there's no doubt in my mind the final product would've been better but also visually would've looked much better. For christ sakes Whedon didn't even try to make the look of the film consistent. Zack shot on film and Whedon shot on digital",2
"look at behind the scene, batman stuntman in rooftop scene wearing shorts",1
Lol thank you! :p,3
Most features are more than 100 pages. It‚Äôs roughly a page per minute of screen time.,3
"> Shooting scripts are only around 100 pages usually.   Shooting scripts have an average of 1 page equaling 1 minute, with exceptions obviously.   So a shooting script being 80 pages long is pretty on point for any feature that's under 100 minutes long.  If a movie is 120 minutes long, its script is definitely over 100 pages.",3
"I think the Superman script covered both I and II, if I‚Äôm not mistaken.",1
ok cool. was genuinely curious.,1
"Which is funny, since the buzz on TROS and reshoots is about 100x more negative than what happened with JL.    The current rumor is they‚Äôre STILL reshooting, re-editing, and trying to slap together the 3rd Act of Ep IX...and the film comes out in about 32 days. Heard the budget is up to around $500 million due to the multiple rounds of reshoots.",2
"Assumed all that was rumor and then forgot about it because I never heard an official confirmation. Since then, Snyder is still working with WB, so it didn't seem to make sense.",1
"That was the official statement on the situation, the real behind the scenes stuff we dint really know but alot of speculation that they used it to ""fire"" him.",3
That's what I thought I'd heard.,1
"They're okay, but definitely not his best work.",1
His second one sucked.,1
actually everybody agree that first avengers movie is not whedon style at all. only in age of ultron he has control of the movie but marvel studios cut his scenes,0
"Yeah,  i don't understand the hate for the piss in the jar scene.  It's a big "" fuck you"" to Senator Finch, letting her know exactly who was behind the bombing before she died.",3
The editing was many things but it sure wasn‚Äôt cheap. They had three professional editors working on this flick.,0
"???  I know, that's why I said they removed that part and changed it to Bruce bringing her.   They say they added more stuff for Amy and she appears to literally have less to do than she did in the trailers.",1
what good streak? shazam never has huge profits and BoP looks like another shazam,1
I wouldn't object to a GLC film of course but I agree with you.,1
Ah yes this new management that has begun working with Zack again and is releasing his cut?,1
You don't know what Whedon was privy to or not privy to.,2
"He didn't but they could've ended up with someone even worse afterwards. Honestly blame WB. They were stupid to want the Avengers 2.0 so badly they got the guy responsible for it. Then with SS they basically realized half way through they actually wanted GoTG, and guess who they got to make the next one now lol",2
"I absolutely can see some stupid executives wanting that. You ever seen Schnepp's Superman documentary? Where studio execs basically didn't understand these characters at all and wanted Superman to not fly or wear capes? These executives don't read comics, they make dumb decisions in blasted out emails trying to sound smart. Hell, look at Amy Pascal's leaked emails for examples of how dimwitted executives can be.",1
> I still can't see WB execs asking Whedon to specifically include boob jokes and ass shots  have you watched suicide squad?,1
It became really apparent this was not Zack's film anymore when Joss fired Junkie XL and hired Danny Elfman who previously did the Avengers score.,3
Sounds like it's WB's fault for choosing Whedon then.,2
"Not to mention how Wonder Women was treated would have been better (JJ treats his female characters well- Joss is that guy who films up skirt shots, has more glaring 'girly' make up on an Amazon Warrior, boob jokes etc)",1
I dont get brunch though.,1
"They went from MoS, to him fighting Batman, to everyone fighting.  No amount of script can fix JL.  People are fired and hired to create a movie when the movie being made was a mistake to begin with. It is so dumb. The whole premise of the movie is extremely dumb.  They're doing well after Snyder. They should keep that momentum instead of reminding us of that bad narrative.",0
"550 pages (minutes) for both was the original Mario Puzo script. Robert Benton and David Newman cut it down but it was still over 400 pages long for both. Ultimately Donner hated the script anyways (The Puzo script was very campy and reminiscent of the George Reeves show), so he brought on Mankiewitz to rewrite entirely. Not a word of the Puzo script ended up being used, but the Salkinds still gave Puzo the credit and Mankiewitz only got a Creative Consultant credit because the Writers Guild wouldn't accept any of his complaints.",1
"Jesus, say what you will about DC but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a fan base as ready to destroy the thing they love as Star Wars fans",3
Damn I didn't hear that. I was hoping the movie would be a hit for Terrio and Abrams.,2
Where did you get information about the budget?,1
It‚Äôs horse shit.,2
Source??,1
Fuck me that's insane.  I might check it out with some mates so I'll let ya'll know how bad it is,1
"These days it's extremely common for big releases to be in development right up until release. The release date is essentially the ""pencils down"" moment for a production of this magnitude.",1
"I'm pretty sure those are fake news about SW being reshot and re-edited atm, because the movie here overseas is already submitted it's runtime and probably at the moment they are translating it for the release, there is no way you can reshoot and reedit the movie 1 month before release. They can work on CGI and other post production but that's it.",1
"Thing is, Zack finished shooting the movie and was in post production for months before he left. When he did leave, there were only supposed to be minor reshoots. But now we know that Joss Whedon cut out and reshot most of Snyder‚Äôs work.",1

Critical and public reception.   I thought its pretty obvious.,0
"I want a GLC film as well, I just don't think John's is actively working on it, I think it was a side project old management gave him once he was booted off of the grander DC Universe project, now with new management they probably but the kibosh on it.",2
Okay let's put ourselves in his shoes. How does he come onto a production like JL not knowing what he is meant to do? What do you think the studio told him that made him think he was morally okay to do what he did? Also once he knew what he was doing (since he had to at some point since he was the one writing and directing the changes) why didn't he stop? It seemed the promise of a batgirl film was enticing to him.,0
I blame WB as well but no one forced Whedon to accept the job. It's not like he needed the money. Since their plan was to marvelize DC if the Avengers director said no where would that leave WB? I think there is a good chance they would have postponed the film until Zack could come back and they couldn't as easily spin their B.S. narrative.,0
"Sure, but in the other hand, Whedon has been shown to be a major creep, cheating on his partners with women on his shows.",1
God please don't bring up that terrible fucking Elfman score. So generic.,2
"Yeah, this is exactly when I realized there was more going on than what we were told.",1
"i dont know why you are being down-voted, you are absolutely right",0
Star Wars deserves to be destroyed since the creator doesn't care about it anymore. It's just a zombie franchise disney makes billions off now.,1
Maybe it'll be a hit for people who enjoyed two previous movies.,1
Out of his ass. His whole comment was completely unsubstantiated BS.,2
"""Morally ok?""  Directors being hired to finish films is nothing new. It's a job. What was he gonna do, say no? Snyder was GONE. Whedon didn't steal the film or take it away from Snyder. Why say no to the opportunity of putting your stamp on the JL? If it wasn't Whedon it was gonna be somebody else.   It seems you people desperately want a villain in Whedon, when all he did was do what he was hired to do. The film was gonna get fucked with either way, Whedon did what he felt was best. Set aside your bias for a moment and look at it logically. Do you honestly think Whedon maliciously changed the film...like a damn villain? To fuck over Snyder? No. He was probably told to correct what WB deemed wrong with the film and to give it his own spin. He did. Hate it all you want, but the only bad guy here is WB.",2
"No one forced Whedon but someone would take the job. The guys experience is exactly what WB was looking for. If Whedon said no maybe they would've gone with other MCU directors, or someone even worse who would pay even *less* attention to details than Whedon did. I truly think Whedon tried his best to get things to fit but I imagine with his time constraints, budget and just being thrown into someone else's movie is fucking jarring as hell.  Also I have to imagine Whedon doesn't give a shit if WB butchers their own movie and pays him to do it, he's basically a contract worker at that point, it's not like his reputation is going to be ruined because WB threw him a bunch of money and said throw a bunch of stupid jokes in there we just want a bonus.  People's anger need to be directed at WB for lying about keeping the vision, not for letting Joss Marvel-ize the movie, which is something that WB seems to so desperately want to do for some god forsaken reason.",1
All true.   but that argument was about if WB execs would push for 'boob jokes and ass shots' -- and they've clearly done that in previous movies already with different directors,1
"I usually like Elfman but he definitely mailed this one in, all the way.",2
"Yeah, cause George Lucas absolutely wasn't thinking about money when he made teddy-bears Ewoks or fuckin' Gungans. Twas all for the fans and the childrin, cleeeearly.",0
The thing is Whedon is an acomplished director and it is kind of suprising why he would want to step in into a production and try to redo the whole thing when he was given only a month...,1
"disagree, if he refuse and all other director refuse, wb can save 70 million without reshoots alone.  i'm not whedon haters but where his integrity in this situation? marvel studios fuck his age of ultron up but later on he came to DC and try to to the same as marvel studios did to his ultron movie.  thats a low blow he did to another director. thank gos he fired before patty like about his fired new because she knew whedon is fake feminist",0
"Whoever accepted the job deserves ire. It wasn't about the ability to salvage the film it was about replacing Zack. It's like people who say ,""what if the Snyder Cut isn't good?"" They don't get it. It's about Zack's vision and how that was butchered and wanting to see that restored. It's not about some arbitrary definition of ""good"" as if that is the only thing that allows a director's vision to be shared.   I don't care how little help Whedon got it was presumptuous and wrong of him to come onto Zack's production just as it was wrong for Ron Howard to take over Solo. The integrity is lost and a creative was screwed out of what he was hired to do in the first place. WB obviously fucked up but Whedon wasn't exactly struggling with his conscience. If more people questioned it WB wouldn't have had such an easy time getting away with it.  In the end I don't care about the quality of JL. In my eyes it's not even a film worth reviewing because it's not a real film. I actually think quality wise it's just okay but what is the point in critiquing something no one involved cares about? You think it'll help anyone grow as a creative? It's not Zack or Joss' film so who is being critiqued? It's just a mistake that is more of an issue for existing in the first place nevermind it's actual content.",0
As opposed to an unaccomplished director...?,0
yes..a relatively unknown director would jump at the chance of being able to handle this behemoth and get his name out there....Whedon doesn't need to be a hired hand and who given his resume should be quite aware that redoing signifcant portion at this late stage is next to impossible...why would he want to dive into this mess?,1
You sure you‚Äôre just learning?,3
Well I was drawing with pencil for quite some time and now I'm beginning to experiment with paint. ;),2
Learning to paint.....for 20 years :p  Haha anyways very well done. Thanks for sharing!,1
I can hear this picture. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awful Murray‚Äù,1
Great painting! But Murray is awful!,1
Put on a happy face. You did an incredible job!,1
"This is really great! I love the way you did the eyes. They're kind of weird, but in an interesting way. I don't really know what I'm trying to say. Great job, though!",1
I guess OP is a fast learner then...,2
Muuuurray. üòè,1
Must have access to the speed force.,2
"HBO Max launches in May 2020, so Snyder's JL will probably marketed as one of HBO Max's exclusives.  If I can read between the lines as most everyone here already has, there's probably been some negotiation put into place right now for Snyder's version to be ready by then. That'll require editing + any VFX touch-ups to be done now, along with creation of marketing + advertising (which imo will be huge and drive alot of DCEU fans/Snyder fans to sign up).",3
They're still in the final version.,3
These are in the theatrical cut. Don‚Äôt look too much into it.,3
Those are still in the theatrical cut.,3
"It's coming. The HBO Max launch trailer ends with Zack's shot of Henry Cavill taking off like rocket. That gave me the most hope, since that seemed like a wink. [https://youtu.be/eASkqrwdg7Y](https://youtu.be/eASkqrwdg7Y)   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut",3
"If we do get the Snyder Cut, we need Junkie XL's music at all costs.",3
I hope people outside of USA gets to see the Snyder cut as well. It would suck if they only put it as a HBO max exclusive. Hopefully we get a home release simultaneously. I would otherwise lock myself out of internet until they release it here in Sweden lol,2
"I would certainly get HBO Max then when I haven‚Äôt yet been interested in getting it.  Still want a physical copy, though. The movement shouldn‚Äôt end until we get a physical copy.",3
"To be fair they‚Äôve used Snyder shots for promos all along, including stuff never in the movie.",1
IMO I doubt the people editing the promos know or care who shot what. They're just putting random clips together from the movies/tv shows.,1
"So if it‚Äôs successful, and well received, do we get the planned Justice League Part 2?   I don‚Äôt see how they can continue with Aquaman, WW, Harley with a whole different Batman",0
Please make this happen!!!,3
That's exactly my impression as well.,3
Hopefully there is enough funds to change Steppenwolf to the BvS design.,2
"I also think they are negotiating about the release of Snyder cut now. But I don't know what could come next, will some other director or even Zack himself make a sequel to JL?",2
I‚Äôm not joking make it $50 a month - I don‚Äôt care I want to see the Snydercut and will pay whatever necessary to see it,2
"I think this is the last shot for the synder cut to be released on HBO MAX.If it is not launched then,we won‚Äôt get it ever.",0
"Plus, these are still the color regraded shots. Not the original masters.",2
"Yes, but they were Snyder‚Äôs shots that he filmed",2
"As much as I love to see the Snyder cut, tbf that‚Äôs a shot that was included in the theatrical cut. I hope they release it though",2
This was published on Oct 29... that's before this last campaign...so maybe it's just a co-incidence?,2
we're literally going to have to start a Go Fund Me for this movie aren't we?,2
Laserdisc,2
"We don't need physical copies, I don't think WB would make their money back after mass producing them. The easiest way to profit from the cut would be to release it on HBO Max or sell it digitally without having to worry about the physical offsets of DVDs/BRs.",2
JL part 2 was shut down by the time they started production.  They rewrote to make it only one movie. Which is probably why Snyder's cut is said to be three and a half hours long.,2
"That in the DCEU, the Justice League was formed, defeated Steppenwolf and then Batman went into retirement (this explains Affleck‚Äôs departure from the role, Pattinson‚Äôs casting and his Batman being in a entirely separate continuity a la Joker). Superman has repaired his damaged imagine to the world and is now boy-scouting across the globe but we just won‚Äôt see that ever (unless Cavill actually returns to the role).",2
Ben will not be coming back,2
"Snyder is done at WB. He won't be doing anymore i'm sure of it. As much as i want him to do more, i think WB is going in a different direction now.   Releasing Snyders cut of the movie doesn't make it canon. It's just a directors cut of the movie. They're not going to market it as 'Justice League', they'll market it as 'Justice League Directors Cut' or something, with full intention of making people know this is not canon and not how they want it to be played out in the actual canon story line going on now. They'll continue with AM, WW, and Harley just as they are doing now, basing it all off of the theatrical release of JL.",1
I'd cum in my fuckin pants if Junkie XL did the score like he was supposed to too,2
"Probably nothing comes next. It would be in Zack's best interest to move on so he doesn't get screwed again, and WB's best interest to move on since they have a bright future ahead that can respect Zack's work (e.g. Aquaman, WW) while also doing it's own thing.   Given the packed schedule, the earliest Zack could do a movie is 2024; a cartoon series or mini-series might be nice though.",3
Half the movie has shots by Snyder. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2
"Yes, I know, it's from the theatrical cut, but Zack shot that part, as opposed to any mustache-less Whedon reshoots.",1
"This bit is my personal speculation, but they knew DC fans were tuning into the WB keynote presentation since a lot of fans were tweeting the link to the broadcast meeting when it was about to stream (I tuned in live), and advocates of #ReleaseTheSnyderCut have been doing letter-writing campaigns and calls for a long time, so I feel it was a topic they were subtly hinting at without outright commenting on it for whatever their reasons are.¬†",0
I see a fellow veteran of the Format Wars.,1
You know some ppl will find a way to bootleg it and sell it as a physical copy,2
"Umm, Snyder's Blu Ray's sell like Hotcakes. Physical media is making a comeback anyways.",1
"Yes, we do. We need to complete the Superman arc in our movie shelves.",0
Would you... would you _live_ for me?    ---    ^This ^comment ^was ^made ^automatically ^by ^a ^bot ^upon ^the ^mention ^of ^the ^Jared ^Leto ^Joker ^| [^Opt-out] (https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Jared_Leto_Joker),0
Did he tell you that personally?,0
people has opinion and nobody knows until it happen,0
Well then get a new pair because he confirmed he completed the score before he left.,2
junkie xl already confirmed his soundtrack is complete before they fired him,1
"I mean, even if Zack moves on, WB at some point will still have to decide if they continue the universe with direct sequels or reboot the whole thing. I guess we'll know it close to Batman release.",3
Actually it's less than half. Only about 40 minutes are Snyder.,2
You‚Äôre high. Not even twenty minutes are shots by Snyder.,3
Yea but previously they were ONLY using Whedon‚Äôs shots. Now by just using Snyder‚Äôs shots it could be a sign,0
"I hope with all these other indirect hints like following ZS, liking RTSC posts etc, we're heading in the right direction.",1
"Sure, but most people will just bootleg it as a digital copy. I can't speak for everyone but I don't even have a CD/DVD/BR drive in my home, haven't had a physical movie in over a decade..",1
"We should consider ourselves lucky if WB even drops the cut on HBO Max, WB didn't care about your movie originally why would they care about your DVD collection on your shelf?",2
"That dude couldn't even stay in shape for reshoots, you expect him to get back in shape in 5-10 years from now?",2
"Do u honestly believe ben is coming back? What remote reason would WB have for doing that? They have a perfectly fine movie in the works, why would they want to undermine that. Face it, we aren't getting any more snyder stuff besides maybe his cut. Justice league was a catastrophic bomb, we aren't getting a second one for a long ass time, and certainly not with ben.",0
"The universe will live on through Aquaman, Wonder Woman and Shazam.  It's the characters of Superman and Batman that'll never be referenced.",2
"Crisis-like event that reboots the timeline, but some characters retain memory of the old world. This way, you aren't handwaving Zack's awesome trilogy out, but also are free to recast going forward.",2
"Not only that but after Shazam the Snyderverse won‚Äôt be taking the same paths in WW2, SS2, and BOP. Even if you revisit a JL2 doubt Affleck comes back and if he does by then Pattinson will have a sequel out and it will be confusing the audience having two different Batman",1
Point is that there‚Äôs still footage he shot in the final movie.,3
Less than that.,1
Or they‚Äôre just using new scenes for a new HBO Max trailer.,2
There's too much happening at once for it to not be related.,1
"Well I know WB doesn‚Äôt care. I never said they do, as I realized that when they kicked Snyder to the curb.",1
I mean we know Cavill is still in so we'll probably see him  Batman will likely still get referenced looking at Shazam and BOP,2
"There will be Gotham, but no Batman around. It doesn't sound exciting tbh, though these individual movies may end up being pretty good.",2
"If they decide to do another Justice League eventually, they‚Äôll do Flashpoint first and it‚Äôll reset elements of the timeline/bring in the new Batman.",1
"That's not what I originally wanted, but it's not a bad outcome.",2
I wish they‚Äôd just do Pattinson‚Äôs Batman as a prequel.,1
So just have Pattinson do a one off movie and keep Affleck as Batman in the DCU.,0
Oh I know. And I still think these are the color edited shots from the TC. I'm just being pedantic.,2
"I mean, 40 minutes are technically Snyder. They're color edited and redubbed, but they were *technically* shot by Snyder.     Let's be real here, there exists 0 minutes of true unfiltered Snyder in this movie.",2
matt reeves already said his movie is trilogy similar to apes,1
Well that‚Äôs rude,1
"Multiple box office bombs? The only movie that actually bombed was Justice League, and that's because the budget was so high because of the reshoots",3
"All the news we have suggests that ""The Batman"" is not connected to Zack Snyder's DCEU (the movies that you mentioned). Those movies will likely be ignored going forward.  Right now Warner Bros. is focused on individual franchises. There are no plans for a DCEU like the one we've had before. We'll have Batman movies, Wonder Woman movies, Aquaman movies, Suicide Squad and Harley Quinn movies, plus Shazam and Black Adam movies.  If all those franchises continue to be hits like Wonder Woman and Aquaman were, then Warner Bros. will probably explore crossing them over with each other. But right now, there are no plans to do that. Multiple Warner Bros. executives have said that standalone movies are the focus going forward.",3
No one really knows if The Batman is in the DCEU. But it doesn't have to be in it to be a great movie. We don't necessarily need a connected universe. We just need good movies.,1
"From what I understand, there‚Äôs no DCEU anymore the way MCU is. There will just be DC movies. If there‚Äôs an opportunity to connect them well, WB would probably take the chance. But ah MCU-esque DC universe is dead.  >	multiple box office bombs.  There‚Äôs been only one bomb so far, and may be a couple of disappointments. The bigger failure for WB regarding DC is the lack of leadership and vision for a coherent universe, they‚Äôre doing fine otherwise.",1
I also think it‚Äôs huge for Cavill‚Äôs future how Black Adam does itself. It‚Äôs being produced by the Rock and his team of the Garcia‚Äôs and they also represent Henry. If it‚Äôs a big hit (and from the way it sounds so far with Hawkman and the JSA and knowing the Rock‚Äôs superstar status it will probably be a box office hit) they‚Äôll undoubtedly use that leverage to get Henry as Superman in the next one of their Black Adam/Shazam films. How his appearance in that film is received probably determines if he gets another solo movie. That‚Äôs what the most logical train of thought would be imo,1
"Until someone from WB officially spells the future of the franchise out, this going to be a bit like an ink blot with people projecting their hopes, wants, and wishes, I think. (Typically stating it as fact of course.)   Information published in trade journals is considered reliable, and that is how the studio releases info. Regarding Reeves' Batman film Deadline has reported ""This film will in no way carry on the work that Ben Affleck did in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."" The film has cast a different Alfred and Commissioner Gordon than Ben Affleck's Batman had. Reeves' Batman is not a younger version of Zack Snyder's. It is an entirely different Batman.  It appears that Reeves' Batman film will stand alone from the shared universe or continuity established by MoS, BvS, SS, WW, JL, Aquaman, and Shazam that we call the ""DCEU."" It is presumed that Reeves will make a Batman trilogy. But I'm actually not sure if any industry trade has reported that Reeves has indeed signed for a trilogy (if anyone has a link for same please post) versus rather just to make this one film and then if it succeeds presumably a trilogy is likely to proceed. In the latter scenario the movie can, if needed, be a one-off standalone like Joker, which does provide some flexibility. And for that matter a Reeves Batman trilogy can also stand alone, and never connect with anything else.   However it is also certainly possible that Pattinson's Batman could simply be inserted into the existing continuity, and characters and viewers would pretend that the Ben Affleck version simply never existed. This however would in effect erase MoS, BvS, and JL from the continuity's history. Some fans, especially the ones that dislike Snyder's approach (or if ambivalent about it nevertheless feel that overall it failed), would probably like that! Or at least they wouldn't care about that rupture of continuity. But to erase MoS, BvS, and JL from the history of that world would clearly risk alienating Snyder fans.   One thing that I think can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that given that we clearly have an established rogues gallery for a Batman relatively early in his career, Reeves Batman universe seems to somewhat be based on a DC Animated Universe style approach for the world in which Batman exists. This could be tonally quite different from the more grounded current DCEU, although it can be fairly argued that the entire DCEU could begin moving in that same direction as well.   Henry Cavill's future as Superman has been rumored to be over, or unclear, as the studio has not undertaken significant development of his character since JL--and as we all know the theater release of JL bombed. Zack Snyder had completed principal photography for JL but he stepped away because his daughter suicided after completing about 6 months of post production. The theater release of JL was heavily rewritten and reshot at the studio's insistence by Joss Whedon. As most fans that follow the DCEU are aware, Jason Momoa and Zack Snyder have both stated that Snyder's cut of the film is essentially finished.  WB has officially stated that for the time being it will simply focus on having each superhero character (or group, such as Suicide Squad) occupy its own world without having to connect to each other. But this doesn't mean that at some point they won't reconnect and interact again.   There is a recent development within the fandom that any sensible observer must factor in. The week before last the Release The Snyder Cut (RTSC) fan movement had a phenomenally successful event of regularly tweeting the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut hashtag, culminating with a day long event last Sunday. Screenrant reports that Sunday's event produced 900K tweets, reaching easily over 8 billion sets of eyeballs. The outpouring of fan support was evidently so successful that some industry insiders (principally Grace Randolph) have been reporting that negotiations are currently underway for release of the Snyder cut of JL, whether solely on HBO Max alone or combined with a theater release as well.   How the presumed release of the Snyder cut will factor into the DC Films franchise is completely unknown. One possibility that some have suggested is that Snyder's DCEU could continue as part of WB's new Black Label brand of standalone films that Joker launched. If the Snyder cut does get released and it is popular and successful, perhaps there could even be a continuation of Snyder's originally planned five film arc. And if this comes to pass, then Reeves' Batman would pretty clearly form the foundation for a new separate continuity.   Take with a grain of salt obviously, but Grace Randolph reports that Henry Cavill sided with Joss Whedon about the studio mandated rewrite/reshoots for JL, whereas the rest of the cast was against it. Apparently Henry has always wanted to play a more traditional Superman. If the Snyderverse continues (again, perhaps via Black Label), will Henry even agree to participate?   Another big factor that is as yet a wild card, is J.J. Abrams having made a deal with WB to provide content for HBO Max and presumably DC Films as well. It is presumed that Abrams will make a Superman film. (He wanted to make one in 2003.) If so, will Abrams want to use Henry Cavill? Recast the role? Create his own standalone Superman? Have his Superman be part of the existing continuity? We don't know.",2
"everything that isn't Joker and Batman exists within the world that MoS started.   That's all. They won't be connected in some overarching way. They aren't telling one big story right now.  They just want to make better, more distinct films. If a film is in the ""DCEU"" (not a real thing btw) and is handling characters/moments that came from previous films, the director will read the script and follow suit i.e Gunn with BoP since Quinn is in TSS.   Other than that? We don't know. Flash, New Gods, Batgirl, etc will land wherever they land.",1
We only have casting news so far right? How does that suggests it not being in DCEU? Iron man recasted rhodey and it was still in continuity.  Edit: thanks for the downvote for trying to have a conversation whoever,1
I heard The Batman takes place in the 70's.,1
"Great read, and very thorough. The only thing that you missed were the recent Henry Cavill developments the past few days. His interview in Men's Health where he insists he is still Superman as well as Hiram Garcia's comments that they are interested in using Henry Cavill's Superman in Shazam/Black Adam projects. We shouldn't necessarily read anything definitive from those statements, but I have been saying that unlike Affleck, Cavill wants to remain in the Superman role. The Rock advocating for and pulling strings for him may go a long way in keeping Cavill as Superman in the DCEU, regardless of what a potential director may want. Another interesting tidbit from the Garcia interview is the confirmation that Black Adam is in the DCEU. The recent news of the JSA, Dr. Fate, Isis, Hawkman, etc. being in the movie shows the DCEU is alive and well, and WB is not afraid of still doing crossovers when relevant. My takeaway from all of this is that the DCEU is still WB's priority for DC going forward. Joker is definitely not a part of it, and The Batman is currently up in the air but I believe is more likely to connect to DCEU than not. If they do a future Justice League movie, they'll want to use Battinson if he has been successful. Assuming they do Gotham City Sirens after Birds of Prey, it would make sense to continue using Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman. The DCEU can continue to be different from the MCU by allowing directors to flesh out these individual worlds while still being connected enough to allow for relevant crossover and the occasional big team up.",1
"It didn't replace the entire cast and then ignore the events of Iron Man 1. This is a completely new cast from top to bottom (including replacing the Alfred and Gordon from the early movies, with Gordon going from white to black\*) and will almost certainly not acknowledge BVS or Justice League. In fact, I'd be willing to bet money that it won't. Also gonna bet if Reeves uses the Joker in a sequel, it's not gonna be Leto and he won't have gold teeth or gangsta face tats.  \* And before someone says ""Harvey Dent changed races in the Burton series!,"" those movies at least kept the same Alfred and Gordon actors to provide some vague sense of continuity. This isn't even doing that.",2
"No, there hasn‚Äôt been any news on the time period. It taking place in the past is just fans hoping the movie is about a young Ben Affleck (it‚Äôs not).",1
"I see your point. The whole situation doesn't make sense to me. Are they ever going to have Batman in a universe then? Because SS, WW, Aquaman, Shazam, and Black Adam are for sure in the DCEU and maybe even Flash since Ezra is still Flash. Might go on a limb here and say Henry might stay too. So why not have the new Batman in the DCEU and soft retcon it or semi reboot it like SS.",1
They are basically going to ignore everything Snyder did with Batman and if they make a crossover they will just use Pattinson. So its a full on reboot for Batman and they won't explain it,2
"i am a huge Matt Reeves's fan, but sometimes i do feel like this happened because he wanted complete control of Batverse. Batgirl was also removed from BOP's script.  But don't forget we have Flash.. in future he may fuck up the timeline and crossover may happen and they may explain it as different Earth character like how Arrowverse is explaining it. That's the beauty of Multiverse.",1
That sounds like the best option imo. Retcon the character but keep him in continuity.,1
"That means they're gonna have to kill DCEU Batman. Unless they really want to keep 2 but Batfleck will just be off somewhere that'll never be explained. What would be really cool is if Battinson is in a diff universe and they somehow collide, DCEU Bruce will act as mentor to Battinson. Like Batman Beyond.",1
"Hell yeah, if JJ Abrams has a grand scheme to maybe get Superman back on screen or introduce Hal as Green Lanter and do that movie. Hopefully jj enjoys Snyder‚Äôs vision and could possibly just continue it? As long as he is going to fucking deliver man. It kind of hinges on Rise of Skywalker I feel like.",3
Isn't JJ really close friends with Matt Reevs ?,2
I think he‚Äôs the perfect man to relaunch Superman and maybe the Justice League.,3
"I know it seems to be an unpopular opinion, maybe because of his previous Superman script, but I think JJ would do an amazing job with Superman. He's my first choice if it were up to me. He's been killing it lately with capturing the spirit of these older franchises while refreshing them at the same time.",2
\*Hope intensifies\*,1
"Yeah, something isn't adding up.  Dude will direct the new Superman movie, imo. I mean, his childhood friend and longtime collaborator Matt Reeves is doing The Batman. Figures that WB will pull from these guys to revitalize Batman and Superman. That 500 million dollars is going to be used, people.",1
Cavill will be recast and eventually the new guy will star alongside Pattinson,1
I don't think this is the guy you want as your Kevin Feige.,0
"I really hope he won't do anything with Superman or any other usual DC character. I want him to work on the Green Lantern Corps. I want something new, not the same thing again and again. The GLCs should be a high priority right now.",1
Do JJ and Snyder know each other closely?,2
> As long as he is going to fucking deliver man  JJ Abrams and sticking the landing don't really go hand in hand....,2
"why does everything revolve around snyder on this sub, Cant we just be excited for jj abrams take on superman??????",0
"Yes they went to film school together, if I recall correctly",2
Have you read his Superman: Flyby script?,2
God no.,1
Lol you literally have zero taste.,1
So long as it's more Into Darkness (Heavily inspired by a source but with fresh ideas as well) than Force Awakens (An absolute retread).,0
"Matt Reeves is doing a comic/animated series/noir thing, Abrams should totally do a fun, comic book inspired fucking bad ass Superman movie.",1
Nicholas Hoult. You heard it here first.,1
We‚Äôre getting a series on HBO max,1
"Yeah, they do know one another but not sure how closely? They had a ‚Äòtwitter war‚Äô during BvS and TFA time frame lol",3
"Weren't there stories of JJ and Zack both borrowing Nolan's lens for their IMAX shoots (TFA, BvS)?",1
"Not sure what you mean bud. Wrote and produced Joy Ride, brought intensity back into Mission Impossible, incredible villain. Let‚Äôs see, Cloverfield was awesome but kind of lacking in more than one way. Super 8 was actually good, loved the performances and the creature Brought Star Trek back with a fresh cast, brought Star Wars back even though yeah TFA had some problems but still. Ghost Protocol was dope, as were the recent two sequels.  He has great chops and has stuck the landing.",2
What do you mean he definitely delivered with The Force Awakens?? I don‚Äôt know a single person IRL who disliked that film.,2
"Sadly I‚Äôve only heard things about it, but he wrote that ages ago. I doubt he‚Äôd do the same things.",2
"I mean you seriously don't think he'd use that same script, right? In fact, his co-writer for TROS is BvS and (sorta)JL scribe Chris Terrio, which I think would excite many people here.",3
What was it like?. That title alone is cringe shivering.,1
It‚Äôs gonna happen. You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it.,0
Anything JJ would make with Superman now would likely be better than the Superman shit we‚Äôve gotten for the last 6 years.,0
Maybe he will work on that. Who knows?,0
"They exchanged friendly banter over Twitter concerning SW. That hardly qualifies as a ""Twitter war.""",2
"It's his approach to TFA that worries me. He played really, really safe here, and this isn't what I want from DC.",3
"He can't finish his dinner let alone a good story. His stuff either comes to an abrupt end, or is literally unfinished, imo.",1
"*Raises hand.* I just felt nothing after watching it, much like Justice League or the GL film.",2
"I was underwhelmed, but it was still a competently made film like JJ usually does with his other films.",1
"TFA is well made, successful, well liked...but also safe. Safe to the point that it doesn't push the universe in any direction. He could probably make a successful comic movies, but the idea isn't exciting without a great writer on board to do something interesting",1
Yeah. Let's not forget other things great writers made in inexperienced times of their lives. Aronofsky had that God awful Batman script after all. Talented people worked on Superman lives. The writers of X2 made Superman Returns.,2
"Doubtful, the series is being spearheaded by Greg Berlanti.",1
"Yes I realize that, that‚Äôs why I quoted twitter war?? Bahaha.",3
I mean JJ had to work with/for a person who thinks that it's hard to come up with new SW material üôÑ,2
Well even if he played it less safe and went out people still could be dismissive of it. But I get ya.  That‚Äôs why I am interested to see how Rise of Skywalker turns out,1
Superman is to me the definition of a movie property that would benefit greatly from someone playing it safe.,1
He had to play it safe and remind people why Star Wars was good after the god awful prequels nearly killed the franchise.,0
"Well then consider yourself in the minority my guy. Everyone I know IRL felt that way about Rogue One (half of the people that went with me to the theaters for that one fell asleep during it) and The Last Jedi(destroyed people‚Äôs love for Luke Skywalker).   When Luke finally showed up in TFA, the energy in the theatre was something else. All the hype and anticipation for the sequel...........",0
"I was manly sad that it ended, I wanted more much more. Exact opposite with TLJ, which I was practically waiting for it to just end.",1
Not a single person in the General Audience cares about them ‚Äòplaying it safe‚Äô. Like you said the film was well made and liked by many,1
"I'm almost sure Kennedy will leave after Episode IX release if it makes less than TLJ in box office, which seems quite realistic.",1
"I'll watch it but I'm pretty sure it would be ""ok"" at best for me. More interested in what Feige has to offer in Star Wars.",1
Tell that to Bryan Singer and Superman Returns...,0
"I prefer prequels to these new sequels, but I agree they were controversial.",2
By telling the same damn story but worse? Prequels at least had a great story to tell and were super imaginative even if the execution was flawed,2
"I like TFA, but I know a lot of fans thought it was a rehash of ANH. As for rogue one, it‚Äôs one of the best Star Wars movies and I won‚Äôt be told otherwise.",1
"I, personally, don't care about the general audience.   I'll watch the bland-yet-enjoyable movies too. But the boundary pushing is what really excites me. I don't see JJ as the guy who will give us that. I'll still watch his movies because they are very well made usually. But I'll still miss the weird shit until it breaks out again  Edit: i found like an arrogant dick here. I don't look down on anyone for movie tastes. I just like weird shit that doesn't look like anything else",1
That's what happens with all the Star Wars films.,1
If anyone is next in lane to do with something with star wars trilogy stories it‚Äôll be Favreau,1
"When I mentioned to my IRL friends that TFA was ‚Äòway too similar‚Äô to ANH......they laughed at me for ‚Äònitpicking too hard‚Äô    Seriously there‚Äôs many other opinions out there besides ‚ÄòsEqUeLs BaD, AgReE wITh Me‚Äô that‚Äôs been spreading thru the internet since TLJ disappointed everyone.   I do agree with you about Rogue One, I loved it.",1
"Oh, yes, almost forgot that he'll likely make a SW movie too. That could be interesting as well.",1
I agree. You‚Äôre first comment came off as ‚ÄòeVeRyONe LiKE sEquEl nO ONe hATe‚Äô,1
*I love democracy*,3
But but no one will watch it because its doesnt exist and unfinished and needs 40 million and theres no money to be made durr hurr hurrrr,3
The result so far speaks for itself,3
This is so out of hand. Nothing like this has happened in movie history.,1
"To add to it, Dwayne The Rock Black Adam Johnson liked it!",1
"Be sure to participate, folks. It lets you vote even if you don't have a Facebook account.",1
Lol just watched that last night. Heard The Senate's voice as I read your post.,2
I truly despise this thinking. It‚Äôs like they willingly ignore the evidence.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs done‚Äù doesn‚Äôt get any clearer than that.,3
- John Campea,2
"It has happened plenty of times before. Terry Gilliam's Brazil was fairly infamous because of it. Iirc the studio wanted it cut/changed for American audiences, Gilliam refused and took out a big ad in a newspaper then did a private screening for US film press/critics to rave reviews. He completely tied the studios hands and forced them to release it.   That said, I cant think of a film on the scale of Justice League both from a financial perspective but also the sheer popularity of the franchise.",3
"False: WB previously released Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, very similar circumstances.   Except that the Snyder Cut will be a complete movie because Zack Snyder got to finish principal photography on Justice League before he was replaced by Joss Whedon, Richard Donner who directed Superman The Movie was fired by the Salkind producers while he was still shooting Superman II.   He got replaced by Richard Lester who they owed money from his work on the Three Musketeers if I remember correctly, Ray Fisher who played Victor Stone / Cyborg in JL also stated that Zack shot enough footage for almost two movies. There is a video of this where he says this on stage at a convention, it‚Äôs on YouTube.  I am 99.9% sure that Zack would never let a Workprint or Assembly Cut be released, if the HBO Max rumors are true then WB / Snyder should have enough time to put the final touches on the movie before HBO Max launches in May 2020. I really hope they also choose to distribute it on Blu-Ray / 4K UHD, really need that physical copy next to Man Of Steel and BvS: Ultimate Edition in my collection ‚ù§Ô∏è",3
"True. But all this denial will be so delicious when/if  the film is released, and I will savour every goddamn second of it.",2
It's just ego.,1
"I've seen articles where writers actually said stuff like ""it can't be compared to Superman II because that was in a much more polished state.""   There was a ton of work needed to complete that version. The entire Fortress of Solitude depowering scene for instance used stand ins for Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve. There were reused shots from the first Superman for the battle scenes, CG touch ups and inserts like for the prologue (the missile that big the Phantom Zone was completely CG), screen test footage repurposed to act as real scenes, ADR dialogue from impersonators (a particularly bad one being when Superman says ""I'm not a coward, Zod""), and even Richard Lester footage with new backgrounds (Superman climbs out the Statue of Liberty instead of a random window). The Snyder cut would probably require far less work to complete.",1
IMO the only really comparable aspect to the Donner Cut is that they are both DC based films that differ from their theatrical cuts. It‚Äôs a totally different situation.,1
True that.,1
"It will turn into. ""Its still not his cut. Its a compromise."" Already getting some of that. The possibility of this cut being released bothers some people way more than it should. Especially members of THIS sub.",1
No kidding.,1
"I think the dangerous thing is that if WB do release it as I sincerely hope they do, they will open a Pandora's box of trouble. I guarantee you within a week the RTSC folks will be calling for the Ayer cut. Also there will be calls  in relation to Snyder's DCEU vision, his 5 film arc. I have seen fans online starting to call for that arc to be completed, which is absurd.   The Snyder Cut if it is released will be a one off thing, and probably considered as an alternate timeline and effectively non canon. Which is more than enough for me, I just want to see it. That should be the end of it.   Most studios or businesses in general would NEVER spend millions more on a product that lost them tens of millions of dollars just to please a small number of hardcore fans. If it's released then WB deserve some serious credit for it.",1
I would like the Ayer cut. If and only if its as done or close to as done as JL. I have yet to see anything that makes me think its that complete.   as much as I would love it. I am pretty sure the snydercut we will get wont work within the original 5 part arc. I would love to see that either animated or in a graphic novel.   But we will see,1
"Oh man I would totally love a full on comics arc with Snyder & Terrio's original vision. Starting with Man of Steel. I also wouldnt mind a look, at the original Justice League script/story that was too hardcore for WB.",1
"Cool! I love the belt. If we can‚Äôt get the briefs, the belt breaks up the suit nicely.",3
This would honestly be the best live action Superman suit ever.,3
"Awesome edit!   I don't know how I feel about the curl, though. It doesn't look natural on Henry Cavill, which is a shame as it's the only Superman-related thing that he doesn't have naturally.",3
Unpopular opinion maybe but while I really like this suit I always felt that the cape was a bit too long.  At this length it's a trip hazard though it's not like Superman could ever fall so maybe they felt it was okay.,1
Awesome job,1
Fucking perfection. Need this in motion ASAP,1
Man of steel suit was perfect in it's fabric and tone..,2
Lovely.  Superman standing in front of New York feels so wrong to me lol,1
I like it. Muscle definition could be toned down (think MoS rather than BvS/JL) but other than that it‚Äôs close to perfection.,1
"Awesome job .. I do prefer the Man Of Steel suit though , it had less muscles showing.  Fancy doing one with that Superman.",1
I would be so down for this to be his suit coming back (Just change the hair a bit and I'm golden,1
God the yellow always looks terrible in love action I still don‚Äôt understand how people want it,1
This is fucking it.,1
The colours are perfect. It never made any sense as to why his suit was almost black.,0
Fantastic. Love how the colours just pop.,0
I think it's more about the slicked back hair.  The curl stands out a little awkwardly when the rest of the hair is perfectly slicked back. If he could try out a different hairstyle where his hair can be more free (I don't know the right word for this) then maybe the curl would look much better.,3
[https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTY4Nzc4YTAtNWZjOS00Njg3LTgyMTItYmJjN2UxMTI5NDU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ1ODEyNjA@.\_V1\_.jpg](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTY4Nzc4YTAtNWZjOS00Njg3LTgyMTItYmJjN2UxMTI5NDU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ1ODEyNjA@._V1_.jpg)  Doesn't look bad to me,2
I agree and typically Superman has a much shorter Cape in the comics that swirls and floats in the air in contrast to Batmans long cloak like cape that can cover his full body.,1
I don't think it's unpopular or even popular.   Superman's cape length varies in the comics. Personally the cape should serve a purpose. Either he uses it for his whirlwind drill move or a shield.   I think it can end at his knees.,1
"If you are basing it on a manip, it is worth nothing actual lighting would be different.",1
The DCEU suits never got black. A dark blue yes but never black.   A thing I notice is some people never consider how blue is going to look in daylight and at night. The light blue some people desire is going to look too bright in the morning and out of place at night.,0
Maybe if he kept some of the curlier hair he had early on in MOS it would look better. I prefer that hair style anyways.,1
But it's Hollywood Reporter....  The be all end all of correct scoops,3
"So what''s with all the ""He DeMaNdEd FuLl CoNtRoL oF AlL ViLlAiN OrIgIn sToRiEs !"" ? That's a pretty specific take.",3
"If I had to guess, THR prematurely reported the Joker sequel. I think there will be an official announcement after Oscar season",2
*The Hollywood Reporter and The Case of the Fabled 'Joker Sequel' Contract*,3
We've been bamboozled!,2
THERE WAS NO GRAPHITE,1
Wish there was an app or something to keep track of reporters who write these articles,1
So IW is legit right? At the same level as Variety and THR?,1
Didn‚Äôt they say no Snyder cut was imminent,2
Putting words into people's mouths is pretty common in the media nowadays unfortunately.,2
its an interview with Todd Phillips not a scoop,2
"The Hollywood Reporter, Deadline, and Variety seem to be the top 3 trades with the most social currency and credibility. Indiewire doesn't really do scoops and just does editorial commentary and reviews, afaik.",1
They say a lot. And sometimes they are correct. Sometimes...,2
They also said Ben was walking. I guess that means he‚Äôs coming back      /s,0
I'd even go as far as saying it's a staple for them.,1
We've been Steppenwolf'ed,2
That's not even a word and I agree with yer!,2
"I'm obviously talking about the interview. They didn't just pull it out of their ass, right?",1
"Wasn't referring to scoops. I was referring to the topic, which in this case is the interview.",1
the interview is in line with what Todd Phillips has always been saying. He already pitched an entire label but WB told him to do 1 movie,1
They‚Äôd be in deep shit if they did that.,1
It‚Äôs a legit interview website yeah,1
"And now they're calling him like Peter Parker was doing to Happy in Homecoming.   ""Hey, Todd! About that Black Label you mentioned a while back. We'd like to hear more when you have the time to drop by the office. XOXO""",1
"That literally means nothing. If it's in line then it's even easier to fabricate, cause you'd have little reason to doubt it.",1
Like they care. Clicks baby. Clicks. Not like it hasn't happen before.,0
No way WB gives him an entire label. Even Todd says it himself. After making the same mistake with Snyder I doubt they will do it again,1
"Journalists care about their reputation. Publications care about their reputation. It‚Äôs also probably illegal to just make up a quote, if Phillips wanted to sue.",1
"The difference here is Todd has proven to be financially successful over the years, especially since he made Hangover and Joker on moderate budgets.  He said that they shot the idea down at the time and only gave him Joker, but I'm pretty sure that they're thinking about the idea more seriously now, which would be stupid to ignore.",1
Clue. Get some.,1
Yet it's happened.,0
I doubt they give him an entire label. Maybe 2 or 3 characters. There are more directors interested in these characters. Mike Flanagan said he pitched a DC movie to WB recently,1
no u,1
"I'm thinking he would oversee that label, not direct and write everyrhing. He would be in charge of getting filmmakers and producing them, because it's impossible to take on so many yourself. Besides, Todd admitted he could only work on 1-2 projects at a time in that Indiewire interview, since he doesn't have the energy for more.",1
And learn what an argument is before responding next time.,1
Remember Keanu Reeves so called Q&A at an art school in London that was later debunked?,1
I would just do it they way we are doing things right now. Get creators to work on different characters. Its worked well so far. I'd rather not have the Kevin Feige model,1
What arguement? You are the one being thick here,1
No I dont,1
"It wouldn't be limiting like that, though. They have full creative freedom to do what they want as long as they're within a determined budget that doesn't compromise the quality.",1
"My point. You don't even know what it is, lol.",1
maybe you were too young? no matter. the internet is at your fingertips.,0
"Regardless, it‚Äôs insane to point to that one single example and now assume that every interview is just made up.",1
That's why don't assume every interview is just made up. Just be weary that it has happened before.,0
Has Todd Phillips said this was made up?   I should have looked at your name earlier....,1
what name? haven't data mined phillips' news so i don't know.,1
Woah Aquaman made more than Joker AND TDK!  King of the sea indeed.,3
Let's hope the trend continues.,3
Really cool that the King is at the top.,3
I just love the Dark Knight Trilogy so much...,3
How cool is that Aquaman clip?,3
If you would‚Äôve told me 10 years ago that Aquaman would be the highest grossing DC movie I would‚Äôve probably laughed. Congrats to the King of the Sea,3
Not shocking that its 3 batman related movies but if you told me 10 years ago aquaman would be the other I would have lost my mind.,3
Hmm not seeing Zack Snyder anywhere on this.  How weird.,3
I wonder what would have happened if The DC cinematic universe wasnt helmed by Zack Snyder..,3
Wow how did Dark Knight Rises beat out Dark Knight? Dark Knight is probably the best batman movie ever made.,3
Are the dark knight rises stats adjusted to inflation ?,2
"I‚Äôm disappointed Shazam didn‚Äôt make the cut, here‚Äôs hoping that Dwayne makes the movie franchise more popular.",2
What you mean Batman V Superman and Man of Steel didn't pass?? I thought they were the greatest movies to ever exist,3
Christopher Nolan is elite.,2
"Three of those films are simply amazing, and they all feature Gotham City.",1
It wasn‚Äôt until Aquaman that I started thinking the DCEU would be okay.,2
Aquaman did more than TDKR ? sheeeeiiit,1
"Do you think there‚Äôs a chance Joker might become the biggest DC Movie? I think it‚Äôll beat out TDKR, but just make it short of Aquaman. Can‚Äôt believe how successful Joker has been. I mean I was already expecting high numbers saying 800m, but 1 billion?! That‚Äôs fucking awesome.",1
So many people here talking that TDK is a comic book movie They r wrong. It's a awesome crime thriller along the lines of Micheal Mann movies,1
And this is why DC milks Batman. Can't blame them when the IP makes this much money,1
The Dark Knight standsout as it made 1B without China and before the market for comic movies even began!,1
OUTRAGEOUS!!,1
Who would of thought that the movie planned to tank became number 1,1
"Before Aquaman: ""Aquaman is the lamest DC superhero""  when Aquaman came out: ""I'm the highest grossing DCEU movie!""",1
Billions of revenue but 0 profits made. Hollywood accounting,1
One of those companies that can fight back Disney.,1
How the fuck did Aquaman do that well lol I wonder if a significant factor towards the Jokers success is the repeat views/moviegoers,1
The lesson is that batman and joker are the ultimate bank duo,1
"Not to offend anyone, but I thought Aquaman sucked. Especially compared to others on that list. The costumes, the acting all felt childish and power ranger-y to me.   Never knew it made a billion dollars.",1
I'm actually amazed that TDKR made more than TDK,1
Batman 89 and Superman 78?,1
If only Justice League was there...,1
Wonder Woman????,1
"Aquaman has to be the most overrated movie of recent times  Sometimes i feel like i'm watching a high-budget, fan made power rangers movie  A shame really because Wan and Momoa are both insanely talented",1
"As someone that has never seen any of these films, which one would be a good one to start with? I‚Äôve seen a few of the marvel films but nothing DC since animated Batman years ago.",1
Budget vs Box-Office?,1
Aquaman should remain on top,1
Where's Justice League?,1
Wan saved the DCEU.,1
Funny that the highest is positively the worst of the 4.,1
"2 great, 2 meh...okay",1
Have these been adjusted for inflation?,1
damn Aquaman was such a bad movie i had no idea it made that much but I guess it's almost impossible for super hero movies not to hit a billion or come damn close.,0
"I know I‚Äôll get downvoted for this, but I can‚Äôt fathom why Aquaman was so successful. I didn‚Äôt just not like it, it was the worst movie I‚Äôve seen in quite a while. I want to show my wife simply because how laughably terrible it was. Jason‚Äôs acting could have been bested by a novice, and the dialogue was ridiculous.   The other 2 we fantastic, not Dark Knight Rises. Obviously so successful because it was following dark night.  Joker is the best movie I‚Äôve seen in a while and Dark Knight, well . . . no contest.",0
"Serious question. If you didn't like a film but it made a billion, would it matter at all to you how much money it made? This isn't a criticism against any of these films, I just notice people cite financial returns as a metric for a film being ""good"" but there are numerous cases where this isn't necessarily the case. Mad Max: Fury Road and Blade Runner 2049 were some of the best films of the past 5 years and they were box office bombs. Meanwhile, those horrible Michael Bay Transformers movies made gobs of money. Money is not an indicator of quality. People should praise movies because they personally liked them not because of how much money they made.",0
HTF has Aquaman made that much?  It's ridiculous.  C'mon...,0
"Aquaman was trash tho, pls remove",0
Next Stop: Justice League: The Snyder Cut,0
How the fuck did Aquaman make so much money? That film was complete dogshit.,0
"One of those is not like the others  And that's Jason Moma.  He looks the part but is imo the worst actor ever.  He literally cant deliver a single line of dialogue.  He can be someone like Kahl Drogo where he just grunts in a made up language, but no way should he ever be in a role where he has to talk back and forth with other actors for a whole movie.  Seriously imo he has the worst delivery of any actor I have ever seen.  I guess it doesnt matter for a kids comic book movie.  But damn is he bad at talking, especially when compared to actors like Phoenix and Bale, the latter two are legit amazing actors.",0
"To be fair, TDK did it with no china and before the huge CBM craze",3
"It‚Äôs incredible if you went back in time to 2005 and said: ‚ÄúAquaman, Guardians of the Galaxy & Iron Man are going to be huge box office smashes, bigger than Spider-Man, The X-Men  & Superman!‚Äù  People would have thought you were crazy.  But here we are.",3
"They need to do some good stand alone movies. I don't care about connecting universes, just give me a good Under the Red Hood  or a Batman Court of Owls movie.",2
Inflation.,1
China likes big loud movies,1
Aquaman was not r rated.,1
Batman and Wonder woman will most likely make 1B,3
Still the greatest,3
"GOAT movies, no competition",3
1 and 2 yes. Last one? Meh. Imo.,0
Still get goosebumps whenever I see that scene,2
"Tbh, I‚Äôm laughing now. I enjoy the movie, but come on, TDK and The Joker are WAY better movies",3
"I watched it with my friend while high off our asses. We just couldn't stop being in awe at that it existed. ""Wow, it looks like they worked really hard on this... but it's *aquaman*...""",1
"I still am losing my mind. I tried watching Aquaman with 4 other people and everyone else got bored and left. I was the only one to finish it and that was more out of a self challenge than anything. How/why did it make so much money?  I just checked, 71% of its gross was from international markets. I think it being released in China is the only reason it beat out the Batman movies.",0
"For a dc sub and the supposed sub that is said to have a lot of snyder fans, the haters seem to be more dominant.",1
"Who cares?  Like...is that the end goal? To like a movie that makes $1b so you can say ‚ÄúI like a movie that made $1b!‚Äù Or so when you‚Äôre near death and thinking over the films that made an impact on your life you can think of all those films that hit one billion and how important that is to you?  At the end of the day I only care about films that take chances, try to connect emotionally with the audience on a deeper level, and are willing to explore new directions in the CBM genre. I could give a flying fuck if a film pads some corporate bigwigs‚Äô pockets. And neither should you. This whole ‚ÄúX film broke one billion dollars‚Äù fad is some crazy level of brainwashing. It made money so it must be good right? I mean Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom must be a top ten film ever then.",1
If only their was a recent DC movie that Snyder created that they could release and rake in money.,0
TDK being so amazing helped boost TDKR,3
"I mean, it's only the sequel to one of the best superhero movies ever made :p.",3
"If I remember correctly it was a front heavy earning on Rises.  Which means TDK did such a good job, people couldn‚Äôt wait to see the next one.",3
"*The Dark Knight* was not released in China, likely because of the scenes with Lau.  Therefore, that put it at a slight disadvantage in terms of box office.  Fortunately, despite this, it was the [highest grossing movie of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_in_film).",2
"TDK didn‚Äôt do that great internationally, guessing the name threw off people back then. Should‚Äôve been called Batman: TDK for international release. By the time TDKR came out, everyone knew it was a Batman movie. That‚Äôs my theory anyway.",1
Because TDK helped create the climate that consistently sees $1B comic book movies become a thing. Before 2008 hitting $1B was extremely rare and now it happens fairly frequently but only really for comic book movies and Star Wars.,1
"So Jurassic World is, since it passed a billion? That the argument you‚Äôre making?",1
"DCEU was okay when Wonder Woman hit the cinemas, sooooooooooo....",0
Those made 1 billion?,1
"$400 and $300 million, respectively.",1
Not quite at billion but still made a lot.,2
It's not overrated. A lot of people didn't like it. I personally really enjoyed it. It's purposefully silly and cheesy.,2
">Sometimes i feel like i'm watching a high-budget, fan made power rangers movie  Yeah, they did go for the Marvel tone for this movie. I'm glad Shazam and Joker were different.",1
"I would watch the Christopher Nolan Batman series   Batman Begins  The Dark Knight  The Dark knight rises   Although they are all action films, they‚Äôre dark themed  dramas that put Batman in a ‚Äúrealistic world‚Äù as much as possible.   So the pacing will be a little different than a marvel film or the current DCEU movies.",1
"Agreed. Aquaman did not feel like a DC movie nor did it feel like it was connected to the other DCEU films, it's tone was so different. It literally looked like it had the budget of the power rangers film. The other three are much better then this film, incredibly overrated film it was.",0
"Well it‚Äôs an action flick that appealed to a wide audience, especially China.",3
Aqua man sucked as a story and the script was weak and overall a bad movie  But it had cool action stuff and all the ads in people supported it so it made a billion. It‚Äôs the Asian black panther,1
It was  a fun action movie with great visuala.  As i was looking for a deep kovie the mvie met my standards,1
Got downvoted for that just the other day. I personally think the fact that it was released during a holiday break and had no real competition that weekend helped substantially. It can't hold a candle to anything else on that list and Momoa's acting is just flat out bad.,0
China gave it $300m  The main reason is most people want to watch action movies and don't care about good story.,0
"Exactly. I watched and it remined me to a Power Rangers TV series episode. People say it had good visual, I think it had a lot of flashy visual, not good visuals. Anyway, still one of the most successful DC movie...",0
I agree with this. Aqua man had some fun action scenes and that‚Äôs it. It felt outdated for the most part,0
In my eyes Aquaman and Shazam are basically MCU films. They would fit right in so in a way I guess this is what the people want? I always kinda gave the DCEU credit for doing it's own thing but I dunno about those 2 films. At least Joker was different and unique enough.,0
i say that about half the marvel movies,1
Which won't receive a billion dollars.,0
"Couldn't agree more. Felt like a copy paste movie, and most of the dialogue is just exposition. Some great action and I like the CGI, but the writing and structure was fucking awful and unoriginal",0
"Also Joker wasn't released in China while Aquaman was released there . Now if you remove China box office from Aquaman and put it against Joker in the box office than Joker beats Aquaman, but this is not a competition I'm just glad DC is doing really well right now.",3
TDK would do 1.5-2 billion if it was released now,3
"There was absolutely a comic book movie craze.   Raimi's Spider-Man and Nolan's Batman were the big ones, but there was plenty of hype before the MCU came along.",3
TDK caused the CBM craze,3
TDK came out in the middle of the CBM craze. Just not MCU.,1
"So refreshing to see Marvel mentioned among DC in a positive phrase. Cheers, to the golden age of comic book movies! May they all be fantastic.",3
Just shows people want to have a good time at the movies. The mainstream hero's have to much pressure to be gritty and epic. Characters that were less popular or are less popular have more wiggle room because theres not a huge fanbase demanding an endgame level movie.,2
not bigger then Spiderman.,1
Ok? This is about DC movies,1
‚ÄòWonder Woman 1984‚Äô has a strong chance but I‚Äôm skeptical Batman will. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything to help boost Batman to reach that billion dollar line. And I don‚Äôt think Batman not having a proper solo cinematic venture in almost a decade is enough reason for it to.,3
"I wouldnt be surprised if Batman made 1,5 or 2 billion",0
All three are phenomenal.,3
In my opinion Rises is a worthy finale.,2
It‚Äôs different flavours. In the end they‚Äôre all amazing movies. The very fact alone that Aquaman who was always laughed at made $1.4B is absolutely amazing. It shows studios‚Äô that IPs they‚Äôre sitting idly on can and will make bank when done well.,3
Box Office has nothing to do with the quality of the movie. Captain Marvel grossed 1B and Wonder Woman didn't.,3
Came on just to say this. Aquaman isn‚Äôt even in the same league as Joker or TDK. Hell I thought Shazam was a way better movie than Aquaman.,2
You‚Äôre laughing because of a statistic? Do you often laugh at facts or is this a one-off?,1
"You're entitled to your opinion, but I loved the movie and I know many people that did. I totally see how it grossed a billion.",2
"I went into this film with high hopes on the back of the reviews and came out wondering why I'd wasted my money. I'm sure I'm just missing something, because a lot of people liked it, but it did nothing for me.",0
Please tell me you dont think the Snyder cut would make a billion dollars if released.  Please tell me you aren‚Äôt that delusional,2
"As much as I love some of Snyders movies (especially MoS) I doubt the Snyder cut would make a lot of money, I don't think the general audience cares that much",2
How can the Snydercut make a billion dollars?,2
"It had about the same OW as TDK and didn‚Äôt hold as well domestically, but did better overseas than TDK did.",1
"I mean, it was better than BvS",2
"Well, yeah. But with the release and success of Aquaman then I was sure it wasn‚Äôt just a fluke.",1
Why am I being downvoted?!,1
I think the China part is key there.,2
"Now this is just my opinion, but I thought the visuals were corny. I know a lot of people liked them, so that‚Äôs just me it seems.   I was actually not expecting anything from this movie, which normally translates to pleasantly surprised. It let me down farther than I could have imagined. Really ‚Äúlowering the bar‚Äù.",0
*its the Asian black panther*. Oh dear.,1
"The holiday timeframe definitely helped but It had Bumblebee, Into the Spiderverse and Mary Poppins to contend with.  The competition and marketing leading up to that weekend was pretty heavy.  No one was certain which one would come out on top, and no one was really predicting this level of breakout from Aquaman beforehand.",2
">had no real competition   It most definitely had competition. Look at any previous posts or analysis of December 2018 box office, aquaman wasnt even expected to do that well. Just because it destroyed the competition doesnt mean the competition wasnt there.",2
"I don't think it's fair to say it only did well due to lack of competition. Movies don't make a billion dollars unless audiences are strongly behind them. And Aquaman also didn't have an amazing opening weekend, if you recall. It made 67 million domestically its opening weekend, which was the lowest of any DCEU movie at that point, and lower than 90 percent of MCU films. It wound up making so much money because it had incredible staying power which was likely helped by good word of mouth. People genuinely liked the movie. Even without China it grossed $858 million, which is a huge amount for an comic book solo film, especially one with a character like Aquaman who is not an top tier A-list character.",1
So bad.,1
So why did Joker also make a billion dollars then? I wonder if that means there are people who want to watch amazing action movies and people who want a focus on good stories,2
This is no longer true for China.  They certainly love their spectacle but it is not the only qualifier for success there.  There have been plenty of big budget films that have done mediocre to flat out flopped there.  Even including the token asian characters is not a key to success there.  Broadly appealing storytelling does seem to be a more common tie with success and having spectacle to enhance the experience is a plus.,2
"Why do you think that? Shazam I can see, cause it was fantastic! Aquaman though? Its just another miss in a long list of them from DC. A few good ones are in the mix there, obviously.",0
"A few, sure. The difference there is they've done the homework to create both a strong overarching storyline, and the individual storylines of the movies. The development is generally strong and the effect work and action are generally tighter.   DC just hasn't put the work in there: it's like they keep changing game plans and throw whatever they have against the wall.  It's so fucking frustrating to see them squander these properties that are the most well-known superheroes in the world.  Truthfully, I kind of want somebody better to buy them out and show them how to do it.   That said, Joker may be the way out of this, but i don't have faith in them to do it.  Hell, if they had thrown money at Nolan to do the rest of the universe it would have done them so much good. They squandered the good faith that the Dark Knight series gave them.  The old ""Marvel is better than DC"" argument from the 70s shouldn't still hold up, but sadly it does in the cinema Universes.  Edit: Reddit's same old problem: try to have a real discussion that doesn't suck the dick of the sub and it's: ""LALALA ICANNOTHEARYOUICANNOTHEARYOU"".  DOWNVOTE.    Be a little less brittle and don't just devote because "" I'm sad now"".",0
"Yes, they finally got around to making actually concise movies again",1
Why did joker not released in China?,1
3d is overrated,3
"I'd argue the attention to Batman Begins caused it, and the result was TDK which went super saiyan with it. Iron Man came out before it and that definitely took cues from giving a good origin treatment and not being shy with a realistic setting, as did a few franchises when it came to restarting everything, and of course superhero franchises. Daredevil wouldn't get off the ground again at Fox because the persistence for wanting something in the vein of Nolan's vision with BB was of importance at the time.",2
"CBM?   Wait, comic book movie, right? That would make sense",2
*laughs in 1990 Captain America*,1
"When they both release good, well received movies, they boost the entire genre collectively.",3
"To be fair, we're talking about Amazing Spider-Man 2, and Guardians grossed more than TASM2",0
Wait till we get close to release date and they start dropping trailers. Believe me ppl will flock to see batman. Hard to gauge interest in a movie so long away,3
If Joker can do 1B (granted Joker had a little bit of a phenomenon going on where it was seen as controversial and dangerous) then I can‚Äôt imagine Batman can‚Äôt.,3
"If anything I think Batman will cross 1 billion with ease. More so than Wonder Woman will, if it does. It‚Äôs Batman. People are going to go see it.",3
If it‚Äôs properly good comic batman it‚Äôs a good chance I‚Äôd say,2
I kind of have Batman fatigue. But Robert Pattinson and a non-DC film universe flick can get me in the theater.,1
Only reason it wouldn‚Äôt is if it is poorly received.,1
Batman is a lock to make a billion.,1
If you just look at market trends it seems like there's a real obsession with superhero movies. Unless the film is plain miserable its likely to hit a billion just from current trends and inflation. I'm skeptical about the quality but it seems WB has learned their lesson lately.,1
i get your point but i truly think it can reach the billion mostly if the movie got good marketing and good reviews but for now Reeves never made a real bad movie and it seems he worked so hard on Batman i have faith but let's see,1
"I think people are underestimating Batmania. Batman is the most popular superhero on the big screen, and if the movie is good, then it‚Äôll be a cultural phenomenon. Look to Batman 89 and Dark Knight as examples of the Caped Crusader taking over. I really do believe The Batman is going to be massive.",1
And what boosted Aquaman? Justice League? üò©,0
"I can't see either. WW was probably the best of the DC CBM (save Joker, and that's not quite a CBM), but I don't see it paying off as big, and Batman reads to me like a star-studded clusterfuck...but I guess we'll see. It's so far away.  Hope not.",0
"Shazam was so underrated, I don't know why that didn't click with a larger audience.  Was it down to just being released between Captain Marvel and Endgame?",2
I liked Aquaman more than Shazam (real Comedies just aren't my type of movie but I enjoyed it for what it was) but I completely agree that Joker and TDK are in another league :-),1
"Most people do, according to Rotten Tomatoes, Shazam! got a 90% review, 83% audience score... Aquaman got 66% and 75%. For a comparison Spiderman 3 got a 63% review rating, you know, the one with emo Tobey Maguire. I'd prefer to watch spiderman 3 instead of Aquaman again because spiderman at least has some charm and doesn't take itself absurdly serious. I guess people really like Jason Momoa?  Edit  Here's a pretty good list of the top 50 superhero movies. Aquaman is ranked 35th and Spiderman 3 ranked 34th, so I'm not the only one that felt like these 2 movies were comparably good/bad. My favorite part is that the Spiderman review starts with   >""So this is how you torpedo a franchise""  And it still beat Aquaman.",0
I'm imagining him staring at a pie chart and laughing himself to tears now.,2
What did you like about it?,0
"Lots of downvotes but nobody has given an opinion as to why we are wrong, so here's my newest theory. Aquaman had almost the exact same domestic earnings as Batman V Superman (305m vs 300m). It must have had something that appealed to foreign audiences and not us. I'd love to know what it is. Venom is the same way, poor domestic results but almost 3x as much internationally.",1
"Realistically, probably not so much.  Snyder definitely has his vision of things but it's not for everyone.   Knowing it's part of a larger story that we'll never get to see is super annoying.  One story at a time man.",1
"Hashtags, movie magic, and lots of luck at this point.",1
"Your opinion, obviously.",0
" if you give aquaman a usual comic book movie total from china ( around 100+ mill), aquaman is still wildly successful. It earned a very healthy amount in US as well",2
"I wonder if the Game of Thrones fanbase pushed it over wanting to see shirtless Momoa? It's just one of those crazy flukes I guess. Now there are Wan fanboys out here claiming it's great just based on the amount of money it made.   This is definitely one of those situations where you feel like you're living in the wrong dimension. It was 5/10 movie *at best*. Hell, even Aquaman as a character has been the butt of jokes for all but the last 5 years or so thanks to DC successfully reconning him as more of a ""badass""",0
Live action Mary Poppins and a Transformers spin-off no one asked for? Spider-Verse was in its 2nd week... Imagine any live action Marvel franchise going against that lineup and calling it competition.,0
"Aquaman and Shazam just have that Marvel quality and tone to them. I admit, not a big fan of Snyder's vision, but I really give DC/WB credit for taking DC and giving it a unique tone separate from Marvel. I know some characters need to have darker and more serious tones than others, but I dunno. I wonder if those 2 films did really well because the GA just enjoys a good action movie with a funny and witty protagonist, which is what I feel like almost every leading character in an MCU is.",0
you dont stick your dick in crazy.,3
Because they live in a society.,3
Yea but 3D cost more. So they get more money,3
"Is it really? I feel like I NEVER see people praising it. I love 3D (when it‚Äôs done well), but I literally don‚Äôt ever see anyone say anything good about it.",2
"Exactly.  And both companies can experiment with different genres and themes, so long as they do them well. That way there is something for everyone.",3
why are we talking about Amazing Spider man?,1
"Matt Reeves is doing a pretty good job at marketing from just the casting announcements alone. Just as the excitement from the previous one is starting to die down, we hear rumours of another, and then boom, he announces it in a fun and refreshing way.  When it comes time to promote the actual movie, I've got no doubt they're going to pull that off amazingly.",3
I definitely agree. It‚Äôs way too soon to make any bold predictions.,2
"Yeah, I don‚Äôt think this new Batman will have any sort of controversial word of mouth as crazy as ‚ÄòJoker‚Äô. I also think the fact that this is a new rendition of Batman, a certain pocket of casual audiences might not be compelled to see it. Spider-Man had this problem. It wasn‚Äôt until his 7th solo film that a Spider-Man movie was finally able to cross a billion dollars at the box office and that was largely thanks to the post ‚ÄòAvengers: Endgame‚Äô hype. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I think the new Batman will do really well, I‚Äôm just doubting if the first entry of a character that‚Äôs been rebooted multiple times can do it.",3
I thought the same thing before ‚ÄòBatman v Superman‚Äô came out. Anything is possible this day and age. Granted I don‚Äôt think it will receive the negative word of mouth that movie had but still anything is possible.,0
Aquaman didn‚Äôt need a boost. The character had never had their own movie on the big screen before so it was able to market itself as a new franchise.,2
"Good reviews from critics and audiences.  And the constant messaging of: don't worry, this is James Wan he knows how to build a universe.",1
"Yes, quite underrated. The scene where Billy's mother disowns him (yet again), when he's found her after years of searching - it was such a dramatic sequence. Gut wrenching!",2
">I'd prefer to watch spiderman 3 instead of Aquaman again because spiderman at least has some charm and doesn't take itself absurdly serious.  Are you implying Aquaman took itself too seriously? Cause it didn't. Everything about the film was over the topic and cheesy. Shouting 'I am black Manta' 'Call me Ocean Master', the pitbull song with the slowmo baywatch style scene etc",2
"Disney remake, finally a good transformers film and easily one of the best comic book movies ever? Yeah that's competition. It wouldve still been competition if Captain Marvel was going up against it for example. Except marvel solo films wouldve been expected to destroy that competioj and DC had come from a bomb JL so expectations for financial success was low  >no one asked for?  This phrase means nothing. No-one asks for films unless they are sequels. There isn't some sign up sheet for what film people want. Never has and never will be a good point to make why a film didnt make a lot of money or wasnt very strong.",2
"Yeah, that sounds about right. I enjoy both.  DC lost a bit of respect from me because they toned down the darkness in . . . was it Batman vs. Superman? I welcome it with open arms! Then they saw how well Marvel was doing and decided to lighten it up.   I certainly could be wrong on the deets, but I think that‚Äôs right? That‚Äôs lame in my book. They should embrace how different they are.",0
Tell me that about 6 years ago,2
"3Dcosts more to film, or the tickets price?",3
"3D is amazing when done well. If you still can, see the new Maleficent movie in 3D. It‚Äôs gorgeous.",1
Yeah that‚Äôs fair reboots don‚Äôt get the same crowd as sequels there‚Äôs no doubt about that,2
"Just because it had a couple of lite hearted moments doesn't mean that overall it wasn't too serious... even the Dark Knight had a few of those. Also, it was super cheesy but didnt play into it at all. He shouldve been making fun of himself the whole way. Spiderman 3 knew it was being cheesy as hell, and it was expressed in his actions and the music choices. Most of the DC heroes work well with the dark, serious nature that DC movies have come to be, and Aquaman needed to be 3/4 of the way to a Marvel movie, as he's the most absurd hero of them all. It was only 1/5 there imo. I mean, there's plenty of documentation saying that others hold this same opinion, so I don't feel bad saying it.",1
"Deadpool was pretty much made because of fans asking for it...   A Disney remake from a very different era that children in 2018 didn't really have interest in is competition for a big name origin movie in the hottest current genre? And again Spider-Verse was in it's *2nd week* so the same kind of people who would have gone to see Aquaman opening probably would have already watched it. Bumblebee was good? I wouldn't know because I lost faith in that franchise for putting out like 3 shit copies of the first Transformers so if it were me going to the movies that weekend in the mood for sci-fi/fantasy/action I'm going to give the ""fresh"" movie series a shot.   So yea, it had competition. It was just weak comparatively. Do you honestly think it would have even come close to those numbers against Capt. Marvel opening on the same weekend?",0
">They should embrace how different they are.  That's exactly what they are now doing. Continuing with dark would be embracing dark, not what they are. Aquaman film was perfectly suited for the cheesy over the top action adventure film. The childlike wonder of Shazam made it great to watch as well. It's a kid after all, no need for WB to make it dark for the sake of it. But Joker should be dark, and that's exactly what they did. WW84 will be cheesy and campy like the 80s and Batman will be dark and noir. Each film embraces the tone that best fits it",1
Price. The tickets cost more. Means the movies make more money that way.,3
The thing you have to take into account thought is that people are going to watch it out of curiosity for Robert Pattinson,2
"And I‚Äôm down for all these different feels, except for pure shit, which is the category Aquaman seems to fall into. All the others I‚Äôm down with. *loved* Wonder Woman. LOVED Joker.",0
My wife does this all the time it drives me nuts.   -Do you want Mcdonalds or Burger King?  -Yes,3
"Interesting. I always thought it was a gimmick. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs starting fade, even if things like imax and surround sound take its place.",1
Tbh I think a lot of people won‚Äôt see it because of Robert Pattinson. People still see him as a sparkling vampire. Kristen‚Äôs Stewart‚Äôs career isn‚Äôt doing any better if you look at her current movie‚Äôs numbers.,1
"I'm talking about tone and nature of the film. You're talking about whether you liked it or not. Completely different. ""Pure shit"" isn't a tone. You could at least make an attempt to understand the point I was making. You said they should embrace how different they are and they have, you just happened to not like that specific film. Doesnt mean they didn't embrace it.",1
"Not starting to fade, bigger than ever, it‚Äôs just ‚Äúartsy‚Äù and low budget movies are typically not shot in 3D",2
"True but batman is a really really big role and a popular icon in culture, the biggest shes done is Charlie's Angel's and that's not even that relevant anymore",2
It was kind of a joke. My bad. I understand what you‚Äôre saying though. What tone were they going for in Aquaman though? In all seriousness.,1
"Weird, last time I saw a movie that even had 3D as an option was infinity war. Every other action blockbuster doesn't have it. My theater must be old school, or just cheap.",1
Agreed. I‚Äôm ready for another Batman movie but I fully expect it to be worse than Nolan‚Äôs which makes me lose interest.,1
"Swashbuckling adventure type film, going different locations around the world with over the topic 80s action films style is what I got when I watched it.",1
"Yeah, maybe. Pretty much every movie at my theatre is in 3D",1
I agree! She kept talking about how much she loved Christopher Reeve‚Äôs Superman in her Wonder Woman interviews.,3
"Should be JJ Abrams imo. A franchise revival that audiences will love is NEEDED for Superman to continue to regularly be in films from now on, everyone needs to understand that.  And before anyone brings up the sole reason to not have him as ""DiD yOu ReAd tHe FlYbY sCrIpT?"", they're obviously going to use another script and probably get someone talented like Christina Hodson to write it for them.",3
She absolutely adores Superman The Movie and paid homage to it in WW. I think she would nail it.,3
Let's see after WW84,3
If she‚Äôs finished her WW trilogy then sure.,3
But she's too busy with WW for now.,1
"That would pull her off of WW3, so I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about that, but I‚Äôm confident in her ability as a director and would happily give her any property she wants.",1
My pick has always been Travis Knight. See Kubo and the Two Strings and the Cybertron battle in Bumblebee for what I mean,2
I don't know honestly. Could work or could not. I think the idea that because a director did well on one project doesn't automatically mean they'd do well with another.   People are a bit quick to get excited as well.   WW did well and people said Patty needs to just run it.   Aquaman did well and people said Wan needs to just run it.   Shazam did well and people said Sandberg needs to just run it.   Joker did well and people said Phillips needs to do all the darker movies.   I'm rooting for whatever director wants to keep Cavill or can work it out with everyone involved to have Cavill in it.,1
"This is obviously subjective taste, etc.  But I would say let's wait to see what WW84 looks like. I take with a grain of salt rumors that its a fiasco. But Patty has said how much she loves the 1978 Superman movie. And if she tries to go back to that vibe with WW84 and recapture that magic from another era, I can envision it bombing tbh. I hope not! But that possibility does concern me a bit.   I liked WW but not nearly as much as MoS or BvS (and hopefully Snyder cut of JL).   I'm obviously a Snyder stan, but I kind of liked Snyder's more cynical, worldly, mysterious spy-like Diana in BvS more than compared with the earnest, naive but coming-of-age Diana in Patty Jenkins' film.",1
Why not? She's proven herself in the genre.,2
I agree. And WW84 is going to snatch all of our wigs.  So yes...,2
"WW84 is going to be her true test in deciding whether she will be good or not since she WW84 is completely her, no inputs from others. If it's good then maybe if not then nope. Superman is already not in good place another flop and we won't see him again for atleast a decade. So it's better to play safe and let JJ Abrams so it",2
"Yes. She'd be more original than JJ, but would still have enough of the other movies there to draw in people. Plus, given WW she'd mostly keep a serious tone with only some well timed levity.     I'm on board.",2
"Hey, that's not a bad idea üòÄ",1
Why would you want her to direct it? She‚Äôs already doing Wonder Woman. Let her stay with that character and get different directors in the movie universe. Another director should helm Superman. Maybe JJ Abrams. But I‚Äôd rather not have the same-ish direction for all films. You lose uniqueness and creativity.,1
"I half agree. I think she did a great job with the optimism and heroism in WW, and could nail the characterization, but I wanna see how WW84 turns out first. It‚Äôs gonna be much more outlandish than the first film, and Superman is often a more outlandish character",1
"As long as she doesn‚Äôt turn him into a Christopher Reeve clone, I‚Äôm all for it",0
He and Chris Terrio should do it üòÅ,2
"First we‚Äôre gonna have to see how good BoP and Flash is for her writing ability.   Screen writing wise, she‚Äôs sub-par.   Then again, a director can interpret how the screenplay comes together and interpret the writing in a serious manner...Thus, Andy Muschetti.    But JJ all the way for MoS 2.",1
Not everything has to be a trilogy . I‚Äôd much prefer her to take on MOS 2 then a third WW . I say that having faith that WW84 will probably be amazing,0
"Some people here want Snyder again despite his multiple failures yet ""wW84 Is GoINg tO bE HEr trUe TEst"".",0
You mean the  3rd act in WW could‚Äôve been better if someone didn‚Äôt meddle with her work?,1
">She'd be more original than JJ  Agree with you. JJ's movie is always good, but too generic. I want to see something new and original.",2
"And here comes the downvotes üôÑ seems like even on this sub the ""comicbookfans"" know just the Reeve version... They should really start reading some comics with Superman..",1
"I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm being downvoted, doesn‚Äôt anyone remember Superman Returns?",1
What‚Äôs so funny?,1
She already has plans and ideas for the third film. Would be ideal to let her finish her series.,3
Giving Snyder all the keys of DC with three failures and then removing him from his completed movie when his daughter passed away was the stupidest decision on WB's part.   And I think that phase is a big lesson and WB should learn to fire directors whose movies aren't working. DC's reputation is quite fragile one big underperformer and all the goodwill is gone,1
"some people is hypocrite, but not us superman fan, not us",1
It sounds like he has a little faith.,0
He's talking about BVS and Mos,1
Well watchmen was also a flop,1
I need Helena Bonham Carter in more things,3
Bonnie Aarons if they are making her a minor character. I would think Granny would be the big bad outside of Darkseid of course,1
I think she'd make a better Mad Harriet.,1
"Helena is pure awesomeness.   Will never happen, but good lord she would make an outstanding Harley Quinn opposite Joaquin Phoenix's Joker.",1
What about Shang Tsung?,0
I was considering Helena Bonham Carter for Granny but I didn‚Äôt see it. I think that Kathy Bates would be better suited for that role.,1
"Yeah idk why people only suggest villains, there‚Äôs tons of hero‚Äôs and groups they could make interesting movies about",3
"People generally have one track minds. I agree with you. If this is actually a planned line of films, they should be just like Elseworld comics. Hopefully WB doesn't just get obsessed with ""villain origin = money"" cuz then they'll feel by the numbers",3
"The success people took from Joker is ""more dark villain movies"" rather than more bold, artistically daring films with the right people behind them.",3
"Personally, I'm gonna keep calling these movies ""DC Elseworlds"" and refuse to stop. DC Black doesn't really make sense as a franchise label, it's too restricting.",3
"There's another point that I think should be noted. Joker is absolutely lightning in a bottle. The vision, the tone, the actor, the character, the box office returns. The awards...  We just aren't going to see this replicated particularly with something like a horror Scarecrow film or a Mr Freeze film. Let's say they spend 60M on a Scarecrow film that makes... 375-500M worldwide. Whether it's decent or not, it will be viewed as a pale imitation of Joker.   OP's thoughts make total sense to me. Think beyond villain origins. I don't think there's any world where a copycat DC film comes close.",3
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to say people are missing the point if the point hasn‚Äôt been made yet...,3
The Question  Plastic Man  Lobo   Steel,1
Not really the point of your post but at this point we don‚Äôt need labels. They never gave the cinematic universe a name so why should any of the standalone films get one? There‚Äôs a good chance ‚ÄòThe Batman‚Äô is going to be its own standalone franchise and I wouldn‚Äôt consider that ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù or ‚ÄúElseworld‚Äù. Same thing applies to the potential New Gods movie or Blackhawks movie. Just let DC films be DC films. If any of the films decide to crossover with each other that‚Äôs great! If any are meant to standalone franchises or a one time thing that‚Äôs great as well. Just make well marketed good movies that audiences will enjoy.,2
They just need to go all out with an Elseworlds label.,1
The Question by David Fincher  Deadshot by Michael Mann,1
"Tbh I would just leave the DC-based stuff thats not connected to the DCEU as Warner Bros. material like they did with superhero/comicbook movies before, because giving them a separate label implies the movies are related, and that just becomes confusing when they are not... like Reeves' Batman has seemingly nothing to do with Joker or the DCEU other than the source material it's drawn from and some people are already confused by that.",2
"I think people need to remember too that Joker is barely a Joker film, but a film with a Joker skin. The US has some morbid fascination with him, probably stemming from a number of reasons, but these other characters aren‚Äôt going to draw the same level of interest. The only reason the MCU is successful with the smaller names is because they promise the films affect the IW storyline (eh...sometimes they do) and they make them into cultural events. People go because they‚Äôre interested in the overall story, not just the character they‚Äôre seeing in that particular film.  There is no tried and true formula. People swear up and down if MoS was more traditional it‚Äôd break a billion, but Shazam was light-hearted, family-oriented, a pretty decent film, and barely broke 300 mil.   Aquaman, to me an inferior film to almost all DCEU releases aside from BvS: TC and Suicide Squad, raked in tons of money. Just metric fucktons.  There‚Äôs never going to be an x+y=1billion formula. Nor should that be the end goal. Despite what many in this sub would have you believe.",1
"No Lex Luthor? Fine. Dark and gritty Kite Man origin movie, here we go!",1
You‚Äôre saying the Black Label isn‚Äôt official...DCEU isn‚Äôt either lol.,2
\#CatwomanWasFirst,1
"DC Black should be stories that wouldn't/shouldn't need a sequel, in my opinion.  Stories like Gotham central could be adapted and fit underneath the DC Black label quite well",1
Imagine The Boys but with actual Justice League members. That's DC Black Label.,1
"Nicolas Winding Refn.   Constantine.    Please, CBM gods.",1
Agreed. Although you can bet your arse I will be first in line to a Lex Luthor film.   Lucifer is my top choice for a DC Black film.,1
"it's more about themes that they could put in the movies rather than lets make an origin movie about this character,",1
"I agree. If we now try to only repeat the villain origin story mold, we miss what made Joker great: a fresh idea and perspective on a comic book character.",1
"Right, give me a Question or Lobo movie rather than a Man Bat or Poison Ivy.",3
People definitely have one track minds. How many horror directors has WB hired or talked for DC properties recently and how many people have immediately jumped to the idea that they must be directing JL Dark?,2
"Its how both the public and studio execs think, unfortunately. Its like they always learn the wrong lessons",2
"It's the same thing, just a different name. Always liked Elsewords tales better than ongoing comics, which are limiting because of canon.",1
Yeah people are really missing the point of this thing that doesn't exist.,2

100% this.,1

"Yooooo, he is my dream cast for Lex.",1
Billy Zane! NOW!,0
Naw Billy Zane for Lex. Fassbender for Reverse Flash,0
"Casting Luthor should be more about his personality. Charming, intelligent and witty in public while also cold, ruthless and intense in private and should be able to switch between both at the drop of a hat.  I think Fassbender would actually be a really good choice based on the Nazi bar scene in *X-Men: First Class*.",3
"Hey, I'm just glad it's not Bryan Cranston for the fifth millionth time.",2
"He could also be black, or literally any other race.",0
Reverse Flash as solo movie?,1
"At the time of his initial fancasting for BvS, Cranston was already older than Hackman was in the role.",1
"If they want to race bend him then yes.i was talking about the race that he is known for.i don‚Äôt know if in comics he ever was black,hispanic or somebody of another race.",0
No more Black race bending please. The Batman is already starting the look like Black Panther.,0
Ohh naw as the villan of a Flash movie,1

"Henry Cavill's Superman is serious, introverted, and occasionally depressed.  But he's not DARK. He saves people all the time just because he can, and chooses to be a costumed hero even after Zod offers him a place with a New Krypton (at the cost of Earth getting destroyed).",3
"All valid points but again, Snyder was building to that Superman, hence why his suit got lighter with every movie. If Clark were to come out the womb with the traditional Superman mindset then it wouldn‚Äôt make for a very good arc. Imo his arc really paid off too. Even though I hated JL it was awesome to finally see that confident Superman. You can‚Äôt have those highs unless you have those lows I guess.",2
No red trunks or cloth suit please!   I think Michael Wilkinson's suit design was outstanding. I loved the whole Kryptonian aesthetic that was so wonderfully realized in the opening scene of MoS.,2
"If you complain about getting downvotes, you're gonna have a bad time.",2
"Kinda funny you would use For Tomorrow where he goes to priest and say "" I'm confessing to you because I know you will soon die "" which is overall darker than most of the DCEU  And as you say, it might be necessary for a story. BvS, as Cavill says, featured a lot of Batman along and uperman being darker, questionning himself as a result of Lex's machinations  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQ4sB-mSHc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQ4sB-mSHc)  This is what we know Superman was supposed to look like in Justice League and despite it being in the night, you can see the lighter shades of blue popping up",1
Honestly my favourite Version of superman is Brandon Routh's kingdom come version. That shade of Blue is perfect,1
The MoS suit would be perfect if it was 5 or 6 shades lighter. And wasn‚Äôt dunked under Battlefield 3s blue color grading the entire movie.,1
"I‚Äôm glad Snyder‚Äôs Superman isn‚Äôt dark, otherwise OP would make some sense.",1
"I love it. I also love the other ones you mentioned. This never occured to me before seeing your post but DCEU's Superman is more scifi, which makes sense for man of steel since it's a grounded scifi ""first encounter"" movie type approach to Superman.",1
"True, Cavill is a bit more serious. I just hope he starts to find his place and become more of a Super Man in his next movies.",0
"True, as I said I really do think JL was a step in the right direction for Superman...and kinda only Superman tbh. I do hope we get the hair curl soon. There is something I would do to build up to him getting his more traditional look but I'll save that for another post.",0
"‚ÄúHey little dude, you got some crap right here.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my face, sir.‚Äù",1
"Yea, they translated it super well from the comics while also kinda making it look like Returns Superman (It is the same Superman)",1
"Right? I hate how whenever I say I want a brighter suit, someone thinks I want [this](https://imgur.com/a/igjktHG). Like no man something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/5D6rNjr). and that's just a shitty mock-up I made in like a minute",0
"Have you seen Snyders photo Superman from Justice League which he released recently, which wasn't in the movie? That was how Superman was supposed to be in JL. He wanted Superman to become the comic version of Superman in Justice League, beacon of hope. Cavill's Superman just had a slower arc to get to the comic version, where normally, it would just take 1 movie, it took 3 movies for Cavill to get to be the comic version in the Snydercut of JL. That was the plan.   It makes so much sense too. An overpower demigod with a sense of morality will always question himself whether he should do what he should do. He does want to help, but he learns his role in the world through the 3 movies. At the end of BvS, he chooses again to just save the world because it is his home and will always do it no matter the criticisms. We have no idea what his original arc was gonna be in the SnyderCut of JL. Maybe he doesn't regain his memories and becomes the beacon of hope, but when Darkseid kills Lois, his mentality weakens a bit and Darksides uses the Antilife equation to make Superman his thrall, which becomes the Knightmare version of Superman.   After JL2, where Flash goes back in time and Batman saves Lois, we get the complete version of Superman, where is experienced and sure of himself. I think this makes Superman so much more interesting, that he is fallible instead of always making the correct decisions. Very interesting arc and growth in character.",1
"Snyder said he had shot everything before he left, so likely would not have those scenes.",3
Those scenes are not in the SC. Since everything was shot before Mission Impossible required Henry to have a mustache.,3
"Good gracious, no.",2
"does anyone have a list of the exactly what shots had the mustache removed on? I know obviously that first scene with the kids cell phone footage, but i honestly don't know what else there was",1
"Oh man, that's awesome! It would be so great to have the Snyder cut!",3
Seemingly everything except for Lennix as Swanwick.,1
That's good news. I would not lament never having to see those again.,1
Whew! Release the SnyderCut!,2
"I'm pretty sure almost everything we saw of Superman was a reshoot other than a couple of tiny bits at the farm (with Lois and with Bruce at the end), and a couple of small shots in the Memorial Park fight, though even that had a lot of reshoot in it too.  As for a proper list though, I'm afraid I've never seen a definitive one.",1
***ALL OF THIS IS RESHOOTS BY WHEDON WHICH IS NOT IN SNYDER'S CUT***  \- superman with kid's cellphone   \- superman revive and flew over kryptonian ship  \- do you believe scene  \- itchy scene at farm  \- superman met batman again and batman turned into tsundere  \- superman talking to flash about taking right and he talking left  \- superman saving apartment full with russian  \- superman used froze breath to steppenwolf axe  &#x200B;  ***THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SUPERMAN IN SNYDER'S CUT***  \- Superman felt he being stab again and again before revive  \- Superman turned rogue and fight league after steppenwolf use motherbox or so i read the rumors from test screening  \- clark kent propose to lois lane like in the trailer after he revive  \- superman inside kryptonian ship \*deleted scene that release for bluray special  \- superman second flight  \- superman came and beating steppenwolf similar to theater's cut but this time superman combo with aquaman and wonder woman chop steppenwolf head,1
I would prefer it 2 years ago. Having a cliffhanger that will never be continued doesn‚Äôt make it that exciting for me now.,2
"What is undeniable about the synder cut is that is was finished shooting,aside from reshoots.What is debatable is how finished was the film ( I believe very)",2
"It wouldn't bother me that much. I love Zack Snyder's movies so I'm really hoping to see what he did with JL. Man of Steel is one of my favourite comic book films. As it is now, JL is the only DCU movie I don't have on blu-ray.",3
Would it be a cliffhanger? The script was rewritten to not build to JL 2 and 3. Seems like it'll just close out the loop.,2
"The original two-part Justice League that Snyder was originally going to work on probably had a cliffhanger. I don‚Äôt see this JL having one if we were going to wait two-three more years for the second part with other films in between.  Darkseid speaking to them could feel like one, but I bet even Snyder‚Äôs Cut ends with Clark ripping off his shirt to fly off in Metropolis...which would be better going along with Junkie‚Äôs score.",2
They could make the second part as a graphic novel or animated movie.,1
"I hope you're right, it sure seems that way.",2
"You talk like I said it wouldn‚Äôt be great to have it. Of course it would be, just not remotely the same. Its end will be mixed for me.",2
"From what I understand it's no more a cliffhanger than just knowing Darkseid is out there and now knows about the League. So kinda like Thanos when he said 'I'll do it myself"" in the MCU.  I can live with that. Though I'm hoping this film does incredibly well and someone at WB suggests putting Zack on another DCEU movie.",3
Oh really? That would be great!,1
"Oh for sure, I agree, it would be depressing not to ever have the second part, but that would be mitigated by wiping away the Whedon mess forever (in my mind anyway).",2
Being bad at telling a story doesn't mean you wrote the story. There are films with bad scripts that still manage to turn out good and films with good scripts that end up shitty in the final product.,2
"He got a writing credit on WW cause he helped tie it into his other DCEU movies, so it‚Äôs kinda a bit much to say that he wrote the movie. He also wrote sucker punch",3
Snyder got story credit because he casted Gal and tied it into the other DCEU movies. You can get story credit by literally writing a 2 page rough outline of the story. Patty said Geoff Johns rewrote the final WW script.,3
That just means he came up with the story. He did not write the script.,2
When people say he sucks at story they don‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a poor writer. Falling short at telling a story on screen means he falls short as a director. That‚Äôs literally what the director does.,3
"He didn‚Äôt wrote WW story he get story credit as the story directory ties into BVS with the whole picture thingy:. Allan Henbeirg wrote the bulk of the story with element from Jason Fuchs who wrote a earlier draft.  Also story=\ = script   Story: Michael drove home with Sam for 30 min talked thoughout.  Script: -Car color, maker                   -Weather                     - time in the day                      -Michael and Sam description                      -Actual dialogue between the two   Also the criticisms not about him being able to write or not it‚Äôs about being able to tell said story. A great script an fall apart under the wrong direction just like a basic script can be elvated under the right one.  The criticisms that Snyder doesn‚Äôt have the necessary sensitivity to tell great stories.",2
He wrote Sucker Punch and that shitty 300 sequel. Wonder Woman wasn‚Äôt his writing entirely.     And he got Story credit. He didn‚Äôt write the script.,3
"People normally say he sucks at storytelling.....not stories, but storytelling.",2
"As everyone has said, it's about his ability to tell the story, not his ability to create one. Coming from someone who absolutely *adores* BvS, that's one of his weakest points. The movie could've been even better if he knew how to trim the fat and really streamline the massive script, making lines sound more natural, seeing what works on screen and what doesn't. Iirc for BvS he literally just shot the script as is. A director needs to do more than that. That's where the story telling comes in.",2
"Snyder has great concepts, like BvS and MOS' stories sound good on paper but he lacks execution",1
"Saying someone is bad at telling a story does not specifically mean they have to literally be the writer. Directors also tell stories.  Being credited with ""Story By"" does not mean that one literally wrote the entire story. It just means that they were involved with putting together some of the broad strokes of the film's ideas. Sometimes, it may just mean you had first crack at forming the story, and none of what you wrote made it into the film (case in point: Colin Trevorrow just received Story By credit for Star Wars, despite JJ Abrams starting from scratch. At the same time, not receiving Story By credit does not mean someone wasn't intimately involved with molding the film and its writing, directors often are, even if they didn't put pen to paper and write.  So Zack Snyder, who has a writing credit for Wonder Woman, probably was not the driving screenwriter behind the project. At the same time, Man of Steel and especially BvS were also partially and largely, respectively, his ideas, despite him not being a credited writer.  But what he did write (and direct and produce) was Sucker Punch, as well as 300: Rise of an Empire (writer and producer). And they were awful.",2
He wrote Sucker Punch and the 300 sequel. So you are straight up wrong. Couldn't you have bother to at least look it up before making this thread?,0
"Jesus, people I'm only talking DCEU here. Sucker Punch sucked, I know. 300's sequel sucked, I know. Guess what, there are tons of movies otherwise good directors or writers have done that suck. Goyer wrote the scripts for TDK trilogy. He also directed Blade Trinity. Am I saying one negates the other? No, I'm saying that the situation is much more complex that ""good writer or bad writer"". Richard Lester was known for great movies. He also made Superman III.     Not to mention that I don't even think the script was the 300 sequel's problem. The problem was there never should've been a 300 sequel.",0
Just keep hatin on Snyder y‚Äôall! We thrive on it!!,0
"I'm mostly talking to the people who bitch about Snyder's ""bad writing"". Him purely as a storyTELLER is just personal preference. On that side, I think he has a lot of good (MoS, a lot of BvS, Watchmen), but also some bad (Sucker Punch, Sucker Punch, Sucker Punch. Have I mentioned I really hate Sucker Punch?).",0
Wrong. He wrote the story. Check credits,0
">Geoff Johns  Geoff is the one of the mortal enemies of Snyder fans, lol. So it's funny that he had a major role in the script.",3
I never said he wrote the script. He didn't write any DCEU scripts.,1
"I'll give you Sucker Punch (I love Snyder and even I couldn't be bothered with that movie). But let's face it, with the premise he was given for 300 2, nobody could've made it good. As well, Snyder didn't write any actual scripts I don't think. Even JL was a Terrio script.  What I'm trying to say is IN CONTEXT of the DCEU, he only has one released movie's story partly credited to him, and it's universally beloved, as well as a movie we haven't seen yet.",0
The writing in Sucker Punch is the best thing about the movie (I'm not a fan of Sucker Punch's action scenes). Same thing for that shitty 300 sequel (its problems are the main character and the bland director).,0
We thrive on it too.,2
"We'll have to agree to disagree on that. I find a lot of his movies have a pretty consistent set of problems, though I did more or less like Man of Steel.",1
"Yeah again, he tied the story into other movies and because he cast the main lead. That doesn‚Äôt mean he was actually responsible for the story.",2
There is so much of Johns‚Äô work in WW. Patty loves Geoff. Sung his praises every chance she could and brought him back to write the sequel‚Äôs script. Same with Wan and Aquaman. They took from Johns‚Äô work in the comics.,2
"Geoff also constantly talked about how DC needs to have more jokes (Even Batman), threw off the course of JL, and killed Ben's interest in playing Batman. I wouldn't be surprised if Geoff's WW rewrites included making Ares a video game villain.",0
Oh ok. Well your comment about ‚ÄúSnyder having good visuals but bad story‚Äù usually refers to the writing in his movies. I don‚Äôt think anyone had a problem with the stories for bvs and mos.,0
300 was incredible,1
"Again, as a storyteller that's just preference. It also depends on what part of the story you find more interesting. I love the Platonic ""just man"" arc, so MoS and BvS work for me. I also understand that I'm a complete nerd who has read *The Republic* and that anyone who hasn't will take the story more at face value where it can only barely work if you're being generous.",0
Dude read the fucking credits. Screenplay by. Story by. Wtf?,0
"No he didn‚Äôt. Geoff loves and knows DC more than anyone and has done more for DC as a brand than Snyder has. DC is all about heart, heroics, and hope. That‚Äôs DC comics. Snyder literally read The Dark Knight Returns- which is super cynical and Injustice which is even more cynical and went ‚Äúcool let‚Äôs make that a movie‚Äù. Snyder‚Äôs BvS turned off generations of Batman and Superman fans and made DC look like a joke. Please, and I ask respectfully read some more DC comics other than Elseworld stories to get a feel for why DC is supposed to be like.   ‚ÄúAres a video game villain‚Äù like Zod and Doomsday?  Snyderverse fans are usually (not always) not comic readers and only began ‚Äúliking‚Äù Superman from MoS and BvS and think he should be mopey and sad and not talk.",2
"The story is exactly the problem people have with MoS. BvS people actually pull out some legitimate complaints sometimes (And with the theatrical cut, MOST of the time). But MoS 90% of complaints was ""not muh Superman story!"".",1
The first one was.,2
"> Again, as a storyteller that's just preference  Bruh, see where I just said we'll have to agree to disagree. You don't need to leap to defend his movies every time I say I don't think they're that good.",1
You can get those credits even with very minimal contribution to the story boarding and the kinds of contributions I mentioned before. Just look at all the other comments on this post explaining it,0
"That's all entirely false. What you're saying is just Geoff's words for starters. That's not 'just' what DC represents. They have far more articulate and adult stories than most main stream comic labels, and they pride themselves on this. MoS has heart, heroics and hope and funnily enough so does BvS. They even have humour. I think WW one was successful because there was less influence from John's. On the other hand SS and Justice League both failed because of him and those campy superhero ideas.   Also suggesting Snyder fans do not read comics is utterly absurd. It's more like the other way around. Most readers and Snyder fans are already aware and have familiarised themselves with campy stories and guest crossovers, thats why comics series such as 'the dark knight returns' or 'no man's land', justice league year one, origins series, all star Superman I can go on and on, are just contributions to wanting better, diverse and well written exploration in the movies such as Snyders.   Zod and Doomsday were hardly video game villains and clearly zod even in death had a bigger part to play. Ares was a one trick pony and he looked far better in Zacks interp. Ffs it was professor lupin, literally!, Still had that stupid moustache the whole time as well!. If anything it was pantomime than videogame. The guy gets it, I'm sorry, but you don't.   Or you do, but you're just one of those 'hate Snyder for the sake of it' people.",0
"Actually most Snyder fans are avid comics readers, and a lot of Snyder haters are DCAU fans exclusively and don't know anything about the comics themselves. Also, if you think DC is only about hope and heroics, you've barely read any Batman. Or 80s Superman. Or like 70% of DC comics.     Zod was a tragic villain far better than Ares. Zod had protecting Krypton literally in his DNA. He couldn't not try and save Krypton and when that purpose is lost, he goes suicidal. He forces Clark to kill him.     Injustice wasn't going to be in Snyder's arc. Superman would've been brainwashed (Not willfully evil) for like 10% of JL3 in the OG plan, and even that was kabashed before JL started shooting.     Finally, the Elseworlds stories are usually some of the best. Dark Knight Returns, All Star Superman, For Tomorrow, Earth One, Arkham Asylum, etc.     DC isn't about hope. Superman is about hope. And you know what's hopeful to me? Having so much faith in humanity that you can sacrifice yourself for them even if they hate you. Having so much love of humanity and family that you do whatever you can to protect it. Letting a potential threat go because a little girl a nation away needs saving. That's heroism. Not using super laser eyes to rebuild the Wall of China. Not quipping while a space demon is trying to control the world. Not just lifting a heavy rock off the Earth. It's testing your limits to throw a moving bomb into space, it's going across the Earth to stop the world engine, it's sacrificing yourself for the future of humanity. That's heroism, that's hopeful.",0
"Damn, just found something to call out your ""not rEaL DC fAn"" thing from one of the people who knows DC best: https://mobile.twitter.com/jayoliva1/status/1198045218336989186",0
The only complaint  story wise I‚Äôve heard is about Superman killing Zod. Other wise I think people like the stories. That‚Äôs part of the reason why everyone was so hyped for bvs and mos. they have some epic stories.,0
I'm agreeing with you here dude. That's literally what I'm saying.,1
"It's very quiet all of a sudden, isn't it üòè",1
"Let it go, dude.",1
So I'm not allowed to agree with you?     That's illogical.,1
See what I mean?,1
"Those statements are pretty old already. Both Henry‚Äôs and WB‚Äôs.  Wanna know what ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt change a thing‚Äù? Sources and so called ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù that say WB has no intention to release the SC. Because last year it was WB hiring some dude to write an article about the ‚Äúmagical cut that doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù, now they‚Äôd conveniently saying ‚Äúwe wont release this thing that apparently didn‚Äôt even exist!‚Äù They changed tune based on what happens, they‚Äôll eventually crack and capitalize on the Cut.",3
"Well that‚Äôs his opinion. The rest of the cast and crew is on board and from what we know of the cut it would change a lot for them. Also, WB just said they have no plans right now. Doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt.",2
I agree that you take click bait too seriously.,2
old news bruh,2
This is old and of course smells like PR for their company. Snyder Cut as we heard has a lot of different stuff so yeah it can change what we got in our minds.,2
"Yeah, an old interview that contradicts things he's said before and recently and was done mostly to save face while his standing as Superman was up in the air. Definitely his true opinion!  The SC would change many things. WB releasing it would show that not only do they listen, but they admit their mistakes. Us getting it would finally give us closure. It would signify WB finally learning not to do this anymore. It would give us a better sendoff to Affleck than theatrical JL. Blu Ray sales would make them tons of money.  There is literally no reason not to release it.",3
"So you think that in 2018, when the Snyder Cut wasn't that big of a deal, Henry, who had a horrible relationship with WB after that mess called Josstice League, would've made it worse by saying ""the better movie is in the cutting room floor, release it""? He was just being professional.",2
"A bit of an idiotic comment from Henry honestly. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it will change anything or not, financially. Most of all, WB owes it to the cast and crew that want their hard work to be released. I would be surprised if his opinions have remained the same because as far as I‚Äôm concerned Whedon‚Äôs JL was an embarrassing display for everyone involved, especially Henry.",1
"Henry has lost a lot of cool points with me. He has enough time to like BossLogic's post on instagram ([https://www.instagram.com/p/B5MO59xgMsC/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5MO59xgMsC/)), but doesn't make the time to post the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut hashtag. He comes across as aloof and not a team player like the rest of the cast.",1
"Its gonna be really hilarious,  if after all this noise, the so called cut is released, and it turns out to be a xmen origins wolverine sized pile of shit.",0
"Good. I'm glad he's on record saying this because when it comes out and it changes stuff, he's going to look foolish.",0
Contradicts what?,0
"Let me preface by saying I agree they should release the Snyder cut to give us fans of his universe closure, but...  > WB releasing it would show that not only do they listen, but they admit their mistakes.  This is pretty ridiculous.  Justice League was literally a direct result of WB listening, admitting to, and trying to fix their mistakes.  You seem to think WB was the underlying problem here.  They weren‚Äôt.  The problem was, whether we agree with them or not, the general audience showed with their wallets that they weren‚Äôt fans of Snyder‚Äôs DCEU.  They didn‚Äôt like Superman in MoS or BvS.  That‚Äôs not saying they didn‚Äôt like the acting, they didn‚Äôt like the character.  They didn‚Äôt like Batman in BvS or JL.  Again, no one hated the acting, it was the character again.  Their flagship property was becoming a niche product where small groups of people liked it and everyone else was practically making fun of it.  Do you honestly think a Zack Snyder DCEU would ever have came close to the kind of money Endgame made?  Because WB knows that wasn‚Äôt happening, and they knew the value of this property and that it should be making *more* than Avengers.  So while I ultimately agree they should release the Snyder Cut, if the logic WB used to not release it was ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want people to think we‚Äôre going back to doing the things with these characters our audience didn‚Äôt like‚Äù, then while I‚Äôd still disagree with them I‚Äôd at least understand why they are saying that.",0
When will people understand that the relative and subjective quality of the film is not the point?,2
That doesn‚Äôt really matter to those fighting for it anyways. They‚Äôll defend it to death.,1
ü§£ agree with you,0
"Before JL came out and all the cast members were contractually obligated to hype up Whedon's movie, Cavill was heavily on board with Snyder's take. And since then, recently he has expressed a lot of disapproval towards how he was treated in theatrical JL.  He's just trying not to upset WB when his position is in jeopardy. Gadot and Momoa can say whatever they want, they're too well liked. Fisher can say whatever he wants to, he's out anyways. Cavill is in a more delicate position.  Let me put it this way, I'll trust the words of several cast members who will get no consequences for speaking their mind over one who would have to put his job in jeopardy to say anything. If I were in Cavill's shoes, I'd keep my mouth shut too.",2
He just had a new interview.,1
"In their attempt to fix ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù that actually weren‚Äôt there (ToO dArK, ToO LonG, ToO SeRiOuS, NoT sMilEy) they made a huge mistake, and they have to rectify for it if they really are the ‚Äúdirectors studio‚Äù they priee themselves to be.  MoS and BvS made together 1.5B dollars and broke BlueRay records. Regardless whether you agree or not, the fanbase for both has always been existent and very huge.   If they didn‚Äôt like Henry as Superman, the Internet wouldn‚Äôt have broken in two when the rumor of him leaving started to float. If thwy didn‚Äôt like Affleck as Batman in BvS, I wouldn‚Äôt have seen so many people to this day praise Affleck‚Äôs Batman. JL Batman is a direct result of WB turning the film into something that it isn‚Äôt so obviously it didn‚Äôt get the best reaction to ‚Äúouch my leg hurty‚Äù. The fans are not small groups, the haters have been so obnoxiously vocal for so long they do seem like the majority, but they arent.   Zack Snyder was never aiming for Endgame levels anyway, he cares about the fans more than he cares about money. Endgame is a result of two decades  years of building up an event so important that next to no one cares as much about the MCU when it came and went. To say a movie must make Endgame money to be considered a success is very shallow.",1
Almost as if they liked Snyder‚Äôs previous work so they wanna see more. Crazy smh!,2
And? He doesn‚Äôt say anything about the Snyder cut,1
"> In their attempt to fix ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù that actually weren‚Äôt there (ToO dArK, ToO LonG, ToO SeRiOuS, NoT sMilEy) they made a huge mistake, and they have to rectify for it if they really are the ‚Äúdirectors studio‚Äù they priee themselves to be.  I mean... those were the criticisms of both movies lol.  You and me not agreeing and making fun of it doesn‚Äôt mean their opinion doesn‚Äôt exist.  They can be a directors studio while being protective of their property.  Marvel does it all the time and yet the directors still get to take risks with the property, they‚Äôre just calculated risks and they make sure it works within the story.  > MoS and BvS made together 1.5B dollars and broke BlueRay records.

And Batman v Superman barely even made it into the top 50 all time for Blue Ray sales (a metric that has been tracked for like 10 years).  > If they didn‚Äôt like Henry as Superman, the Internet wouldn‚Äôt have broken in two when the rumor of him leaving started to float.

They objectively disappointed compared to their projections.  > Zack Snyder was never aiming for Endgame levels anyway, he cares about the fans more than he cares about money.   ... are the people who watched Endgame not fans??  Where did they get the money from??

Yes, but you‚Äôre totally missing the point.  Endgame was the result of *single* decade of building up an event with characters people *barely even knew*.  Literally the most established MCU characters before it kicked off was the Hulk and Spider-Man, who they didn‚Äôt even own for the first half of their story.  Batman and Superman have been in popular culture forever.  While obviously Endgame is unrealistic without tons of movies building up to it, there‚Äôs absolutely no reason a movie with Batman and Superman can‚Äôt cross a billion dollars.  Nolan did it after one movie with only one of them.  >To say a movie must make Endgame money to be considered a success is very shallow.  And to say a studio with Batman and Superman shouldn‚Äôt expect a movie featuring them both to make a billion dollars when Spider-Man, Aquaman, Black Panther, and Captain Marvel are doing it is incredibly naive to the business side of movies.  Acting like Batman and Superman should be treated like an art house project is literally not how the world works lol.",0
A horror-esque Scarecrow movie with someone like James Wan or Mike Flanagan directing would be awesome.  Not sure if it would fit in with DC Black but i recently rewatched Kick-Ass and it made me think a Teen Titans film directed by Matthew Vaughn would be great as well,2
"Catwoman technically wouldn‚Äôt be DC Black if it‚Äôs a spinoff of The Batman, but otherwise I love your list. Very intrigued by Vandal Savage.",2
Damn I wanna see that Savage movie now with Hugh Jackman,2
"The Rogues  No Flash and pick only the non-metahuman villains. Make it a violent, R-rated action/comedy where the members‚Äô egos always get the better of them when they try to pull a heist. Ends with a bloody climax between The Rogues and Central City Police.",2
Lucifer Morningstar.  Based off the actual source material.,2
"Not really interested in other villains. I mean villain movies are neat, but I want DC Black to do The Question. There are so many possibilities for non traditional comic book movies.",1
"Also include Scarecrow and Victor Fries in your list. Both have very tragic backstories which deserves to be explored. Loved your list, especially Vandal Savage fancast",1
"I think vandal savage would have to have its own origin for the big screen rather than completely adapted from the comics, the name alone is corny. Harley Quinn is already getting and r rated bop movie. I think a ganagster two face would be good. Black mask could have been great - but, yeeeaahh... Anyway, I think most of the batman villains would be good. Lex, any of them that are more humanised really, Ra's al Ghul?. Also Lobo!!.",1
"Gotham crime bosses, freeze, ras. Hellblazer would also work perfectly.",1
The Penguin,1
I'd like to see Clayface. I always thought his back story in the animated series was tragically haunting. I'd say it *fits the mold*,1
Mister Freeze,1
"Mr. Freeze, Scarecrow, Riddler.. I mean with a good script you make any character work but a lot of Batman‚Äôs villains can be really strong on their own",1
I like that Vandal Savage idea.  He could harken back to the big epics of Hollywood with their giant battles and grand set-pieces to show how he moved and shook the world.,1
"I would like to see Horror-like Scarecrow movie and Lobo. Apart from villains I'd like to see lesser known characters like The Question, Booster Gold, Red Hood and the Outlaws, Blue Devil, Wild Dog, Hawk and Dove, Azrael, Martian Manhunter, Etrigan etc. Also I think Vertigo movies like Hellblazer, Phantom Stranger, Swamp Thing, etc. would be great.  I'd also like these movies to be R Rated.",1
Man Bat played by Michael C Hall,1
"Starro movie, mothafuckas!  But seriously, an eldritch cult of Starro worshippers amassing power and skirmishing with all sorts of authorities. Set it in 90s Japan, echoing the aum shinrikyo attacks",1
"Even if he is not a villain but an anti-hero,  I‚Äôd like a movie about Jason Todd/Red Hood. I think he is a very interesting character. With the right director and a good cast they might even do an amazing live action version of animated movie ‚Äú Under the Red Hood‚Äù",1
Man! Vandal Savage would be such a brilliant movie!! It has enormous potential.,1
Also movies about some less known DC villains would be good if the directors and the cast are good ( even a movie about Condiment King),1
My personal vote is Kirk Langstrom/ Man Bat. Pretty compelling story.,1
"Deathstroke swings around the spectrum of hero to villain and he has plenty of material to go off of. One of the only villains in comics to have 100+ comics of his own.  Out of every other DC Villain, he's also probably the easiest to make a movie about (even though DC typically effs him up outside comics). His origin story alone is long enough and dramatic enough to make a movie. Has love, hate, action, politics, family drama, relationship drama, friendship, killing, etc. It also doesn't involve the Teen Titans until later when his son dies fighting them.",1
"I think that actually sounds cool, but we gotta wait until after The Flash movie to start talking about it. I definitely could see it as a Deadpool-esque action comedy.",0
I recently saw the animated movie ‚Äú Justice League: Gods and Monsters‚Äù and I think a movie with Michael C Hall as Kirk/Man Bat would be amazing .,0
"Why does it need to be after The Flash? The premise and inclusion of unique villains like Captain Cold and Heatwave can stand out without having a Flash film first. That idea would also be exactly like your Catwoman film where you believe you need the hero‚Äôs film and you don‚Äôt, otherwise it won‚Äôt be standalone.",1
The score üò≠üò≠üò≠,3
10/10. This is the climax of the film - he finally became the Joker,3
"Apparently the original script had him cutting his face into a grin like the Ledger version. I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt do that, because aside from being more original this scene is simpler and actually scarier than that would have been. Less is more, if you will.",3
This is my favorite scene in the movie. The score is amazing here too.,3
Man I know people wants this to be a standalone and I understand and respect that cause I believe this movie doesn't need a sequel as well but a part of me really wants to see Joaquin Joker again and see his rise of becoming the clown prince of crime.,2
"This just is *the* Joker scene for me, including all sources of media. The whole sequence is pure perfection.  e: grammar",2
Watching this on a smartphone or computer doesn't do it justice. Watching this scene on the big screen was one of my favorite moments in theaters.,2
"I wanted the movie to end right there, there was no need of that last Scene of him in an asylum!",1
Smile when life hits you really hard...,2
Yes. Him and Robert Pattinson are such good actors. I would love to see their characters interact in a future Batman/Joker DC film.,1
>Watching this scene on the big screen was one of my favorite moments in theaters.  So True !!,1

Oooo this has me stoked!!,1
Shazam's posture reminds me of when he threw that Batman figure at the bold bad guy lmao  So static lol As if The Rock was toying around with a life-size statue of Levi lmao,1
GOD i cannot wait for this movie. Shazam really blew me away.,1
If they actually have him do a rock bottom I‚Äôd cry,1
"Hey, my new screensaver!!",1
"Does Black Adam also transform whenever he shouts Shazam? I just imagined a scene where he's like: ""Hey, Shazam! Oh, shit..""",1
Billy has probably already learned who he has to he as a person but I hope to see him go a little crazy fighting Black Adam to the point Superman shows up and teaches him when it‚Äôs alright to stop,1
"Someone needs to draw the rock, rock bottoming  one co star from each of his movies in character. Tooth fairy would be great",1
"He's a pretty cool character.  It's kind of like a controversial version of Black Panther if he had the powers of Shazam.  Like not necessarily always evil, but not exactly good either.  He just looks out for his people.  Read up on him if you're interested, he definitely deserves a movie.",3
"In his original incarnation, Khem-Adam was the son of the Pharaoh Rameses II. One of the Pharaoh's high priests, the wizard Shazam, is impressed with Adam's good deeds, and gives him the powers to become his champion by speaking his name. Adam serves as Egypt's champion for centuries until he is corrupted by Shazam's evil daughter Blaze, who convinces him that the two of them should rule Egypt. Adam kills the Pharaoh and appoints himself ruler of Egypt. Shazam is enraged by this and strips Adam of his powers, encasing them in a scarab necklace. Adam's de-powered body rapidly ages and he dies. Shazam locks Adam's corpse and the necklace inside the tomb of Rameses II, where it is found thousands of years later by Theo Adam, an archaeologist, and his companions, C.C. and Marilyn Batson. Theo Adam becomes obsessed with the necklace, and kills the Batsons in order to steal it. After Billy Batson is drafted to become the wizard's second champion, and Theo Adam sees that Captain Marvel looks exactly like C.C. Batson and the lightning bolt on his chest was the same as the one in Khem-Adam's tomb, he realizes the power of the necklace, and speaks Shazam's name to become Black Adam.  He tells Billy that he killed his parents, and they fight. Billy defeats Adam and de-powers him by taking the necklace. He takes Adam to Shazam, who wipes his memory and steals his voice so he can never say his name again.  In the New 52, Aman is a slave who is transported from his cell to the Rock of Eternity and granted power by the wizard Shazam. He uses his power to save Khandaq from the Seven Deadly Sins and then vanishes from history. It is later revealed that Aman had an uncle (who helped Aman escape slavery), whose name was Adam. Adam was injured during their escape, and when Aman was chosen by the wizard to be his champion, Aman shared his power with Adam to heal him. Afterwards, although Aman wanted to use his new power to help his people and cure his former slavemasters of their evil souls, Adam only sought vengeance against those who had enslaved them. To this end, when Aman called down the lightning, Adam seemingly killed Aman so that he himself was the sole recipient of the power. However, the details of Aman's ""death"" are not shown, leaving his fate open to speculation. Black Adam refers to Aman's ""sacrifice"", and tells Billy that he will go to any lengths to ""free this world from those who enslave it"".  The rest of the new 52 origin story for Shazam goes just like the movie, except replace Dr. Sivana with Black Adam. Billy shares his power with his foster siblings who fight the Seven Deadly Sins, and Billy fights Adam alone. He realizes he cannot beat Adam, who is more experienced using Shazam's magic, so he changes back to his normal form. He convinces Adam to do the same so it could be a ""fair fight"". Adam is convinced, but upon returning to normal, he rapidly ages from the millennia and turns to dust. He is eventually revived by Khandaqi revolutionaries to be their champion again, in the *Forever Evil* story line.   These days he's more of an anti-hero than a straight up supervillain.",3
He is fiercely loyal to his people of Kahndaq and will do anything to protect them. He is not above killing and he is crazy powerful and he knows it. So he can be a terrifying figure to come up against. But he has also worked with heroes when it suits him. He‚Äôs got a big don‚Äôt fuck with me I won‚Äôt fuck with you energy.,3
"A random Facebook page didn't make this, it was ultraraw26",3
"Blueberry pie? Peach pie? Apple pie? Boysenberry?   Black Adam, Shazam loves pie. POONTANG PIE.",3
THERE IT IS! MY MAN!,1
He used against Statham on Furious 7,1
And Dwayne Johnson is perfect casting. Looks exactly like BA and his acting has gotten better over the years too,3
Isn‚Äôt that almost like aquaman,3
"Sweet. I will now. I'll be honest.. never got into shazam character...was even reluctant to pick up an issue of shazam, but the movie won me over. I'm really anticipating to see black Adam on screen now :D",1
He treats his people well if they swear obedience to him. Kind of like Dr Doom.,1
"Holy.Shit...LOL nice one! I'll read the dissertation when I get the time, but thanks for all the info! Caught the last line tho üëçI'll be honest, the only anything black Adam for me was playing his character on injustice 2 heh",2
Awesome. Thank you!,1
Ive never seen any Fast Furious except for the first 1. I was thinking of the less popular Skyscraper.,1
"yeah thats fair, idk why i thought of black panther",3
Aquaman helps the rest of the world all of the time.  Black Adam doesn't.,1
Closer to Namor I'd say,1
I got into both characters with Injustice weirdly enough.  I've been more of a bits and pieces person with the character than grabbing comics.  Just the lore itself is pretty interesting to me.,1
"I actually think Black Panther is a better one, though.  Atlantis is legendary.  Kahndaq is more like Wakanda - thought to be backwards by the world, loved by its superpowered leader.    Adam is just less...  principled than T'Challa.",3
"Less principled according to standard superhero morality, yeah?   If I remember right, you can make the (not perfect) comparison that it's like if Killmonger and T'Challa fused. Defend my people and kill those against us. No letting ""proper authorities"" handle it when he can end it now. Kahndaq is important, not Adam's image or how dirty his hands get. He's your Khan or Mesopotamian leader that will cut the hands off a thief.",2
If Doctor Doom was an Egyptian Superman,1
That's pretty much what I had in mind when comparing him to black panther.  I honestly couldn't remember off the top of my head if the rest of the world knew about Kahndaq when he mentioned aquaman which is why I just went with it lol,1
It's just a horror movie that will have the trench as the scary monster. That's all. James Wan probably wants one of his horror proteges directing it. Itll be fairly cheap budget wise for a CBM and do decent numbers cause horror movies earn a lot these days.,3
Maybe a horror movie with like a human ship being attacked by them? I'd bet that's what's going to happen.,3
"I do wonder how much of a DCEU connection the Trench is going to have, and if Aquaman and Atlantis will be mentioned at all.  I think it's an absolutely fantastic idea to have a horror movie set in a superhero world.",3
"The Trench have been guarding the Hidden Sea for thousands of years protecting Atlan's Trident.  Now that it's been claimed, they're free to move inland...",2
Horror film.,2
"I still think they should use Deadwater instead of Trench if their gonna make a Horror spinoff for Aquaman. Deadwater is like an Aquatic Werewolf that turns the host even if there's a single drop of water. Plus the story is gonna be even scarier if the protagonists are not Aquaman or any metahuman because fighting back is not an option for regular humans. This story could also introduce one of Aquaman's villains, The Scavenger.",2
"Could be DC's version of Alien, set in an oil rig in the middle of a hurricane or being trap in an underwater base",1
"I say make it Lovecraftian, 1900th century setting. Book it",1
I think it's going to be a mix of adventure and horror. Maybe an origin story for these creatures. It's definitely releasing on HBO max.,2
I still don't believe they're going to make it.,2
I feel like it‚Äôs going to be very very similar to this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_(film),1
I figured it would be about how they turned into those monsters.,1
Think Aliens meets Pitch Black in the DC universe.,1
"The movie is (likely) not going to center on the Trench creatures. It'll probably be about a small team of scientists that go to the Trench, or something. Like *The Abyss* DC style.",1
Trench stuff.,1
"A monster movie like Jaws and Creature of the black lagoon. It could be very Lovecraft inspired. Maybe the main characters are townspeople, fisherman, or Atlantean teens.",1
"That, maybe with an Atlantean like Garth or someone coming in to explain what's going on and help, maybe even have a cameo by Mamoa and/or Heard at the end.",2
*cries in New Mutants*,2
One Trencher will be a DJ on Ibiza lol.,1
I have never heard of Deadwater prior to this thread. Thank you for sharing :D  He looks awesome!,2
Isn‚Äôt dead water in dc Metal?,1
"Somebody made that godawful Charlie's Angels third reboot. If someone has a pitch and a studio funds it, it will get done.",1
"That's a cool idea.  The protagonist kills the last trench monster inside ship but ship nearly gets destroyed.  She/He goes down into the depths before someone grabs her/him.   Wakes upin a bar and wonders who saved him/her.   ""Drinks on him/her"" says Aquaman as he leaves the bar.   Remember how SPLIT's ending connected to UNBREAKABLE using Will Smith's cameo?",2
Ur welcome :) Loved the design and that story arc.,1
"Dead water was in New 52 Aquaman Vol.8 ""Out of Darkness"" story arc by Dan Abnett way before that. DC Metal might have used the same name.",1
Wasn‚Äôt it Bruce Willis lol,2
Yeah probs,1
"Bruce Willis, Will Smith its close enough",2
Damn.. thats correct.   Here's an upvote,1
"Dwayne Johnson did nothing for the SC. If he wanted to he could have hashtagged and made the movement blow up insanely.   Hes got 10 times the followers as everyone combined.    Dwayne pushing for Henry specifically has solely to do with he and Cavill being represented by the same agent. Danny Garcia. Who has been trying to get Henry a new contract for longer than a year.   If anything, Dwayne making a Black Adam movie and having the pull he does will keep Henry in the role.",3
"The Rock probably does have something to do with Henry Cavill remaining as Superman, but I don't think he had any involvement in the Snyder Cut Movement.",3
The Rock probably has a lot of star power. He is guaranteed money. If he wants Cavill in his movie he could probably get it. That may sway WB to take a look at getting more of Cavills Superman out there. So in a way he could have had a hand in them taking another look at Snydercut outside the movement.   Cavill deserves almost as much Justice for JL as Zack. They butchered my boys face on screen. It will never be forgotten and will never go away. Its a stain on his portfolio of work. That is unless they really step up their Superman game and put out some fantastic Superman material going forward. IF the Snydercut is well received that could be the first step in the right direction since it will at least mean no more fucked up lip for him.,2
"I dont think Rock had any involvement with SC.  He's a cool guy and if he was interested in the movement , he would have tweeted the hashtag since he is going to in DCEU.   Although He do want Cavill to stay as Superman. Because both are universally loved by fans and wants to see superman fight ""THE ROCK"" :)  I think Superman will show up in Shazam 3 just like in comics to fight black adam.",2
I appreciate everyone's comments. I should have explicitly stated in my initial post Dwayne Johnson had an *indirect* impact on the #releasethesnydercut movement since Johnson wanted to leave ZS' continuity in place as the foundation for his world-building and WB executives figured releasing it would only reinforce what was about to happen next.,1
^ This. He has no obligation to (or observable interest in) the movement.,3
"That message he left on Reynolds' video saying ""can't CGI away the pain"" was amazing. It wasn't offensive to WB but still spoke volumes.",1
Why can't I  *c o n s u m e*,1
"**GUIDEPOST:** Before anyone defaults to the studio pushing this on the creators, note that Phillips has indicated in several interviews that Phoenix himself entertained ideas for a follow-up in the latter days of shooting due to his accumulated affection for the work they had just done together. Since Phillips and Phoenix have expressed great mutual enjoyment of their on-set creative partnership on *Joker,* well before the film's runaway success, there is no strong case for the decision to develop a sequel being a studio-driven mandate. Whatever the external factors, Phillips and Phoenix both came by the notion honestly. Given Phoenix's previous reluctance to take on this and other high profile CBM roles, as well as his noted aversion to franchise think, this was not a given from the start no matter how obvious a move armchair history will make it out to be.  **NOTE:** [Here](https://youtu.be/7yTD-z6YaVg) is one of the meatier post-release interviews Phillips has given. Obvious spoiler warning. I cannot guarantee this is the one where he says it, but Phillips is on record revealing that he and Phoenix are well aware that the criminal mastermind angle is open to them.",1
**Time has come for a proper Mr Freeze.**,3
"This is an interesting tidbit:  ""Ballsy Hollywood play: After JOKER opening weekend, Todd Phillips went to WB and demanded access to origin stories of ALL the DC villains...He didn't get it but did walk away from one or two.""  [https://twitter.com/Borys\_Kit/status/1197157039706738689](https://twitter.com/Borys_Kit/status/1197157039706738689)",3
I think this movie should stay a solo film. I loved it but a sequel isn't necessary.,3
Money is on L U T H O R,3
You know what fuck it if we are getting a sequel I'm in. I need to see more of Joaquin Joker in my life cause he was phenomenal in this movie.,3
"If Joaquin Phoenix wants it, I want it too. Bring it on.",3
Phoenix is doing a sequel? That's incredibly surprising.,3
"Please please please please please don‚Äôt ruin it. The one time Joaquin does a sequel, I just hope he doesn‚Äôt regret it.",3
"This is excellent news and I'm genuinely looking forward to seeing what they can do.  That said, I hope it doesn't effect Joker showing up in more traditional comic book movies.  Tons of my non comic book friends went to see Joker and loved it. That was one of the really impressive things Todd got right. It appealed to a wider audience.",3
I‚Äôm torn because Joker was so good and doesn‚Äôt really need a sequel. And let‚Äôs be real... Hangover 2 & 3 sucked compared to the 1st one. I just hope he can deliver and give us The Dark Knight of Joker movies!,3
1. This film needs to stay a solo film. Certain films are so well done that it doesn‚Äôt need a sequel and Joker was one of them.  2. Deathstroke should be on that list of DC origin movies.   3. I would like to see ‚ÄúDC Black‚Äù in the opening.,3
"I mean,we all knew that was coming.",3
"Not surprising at all. The movie was insanely profitable and dominated the BO. Any studio would be dumb not to at least attempt a sequel for such a hit. Sure, it was a planned one-off, but once the cash started rolling in those plans changed immediately. This isn‚Äôt WB being stupid, this is normal Hollywood operating procedure.",2
"If Phillips has more stories to tell he's definitely earned the chance to make more. I remember how adamantly people opposed the idea of a Joker solo film and now it's a critical and financial success. More importantly, I loved the movie.  I'm happy to see what Phillips does next. Maybe it'll flop, maybe it'll be great. If we don't give creatives the room to experiment we'll never get surprised by great movies, and yes, that means risking failure as well. It always does.",2
I so want to see a Poison Ivy like this  and a Mr Freeze,2
Alexander Luthor needs to be explored along with his fathers fist he could not be saved from.,3
"Honestly, I think a great idea for a sequel should be Joker's rise to become the underground crime king in Gotham.  Do it in the style of Scarface, Blow, American Gangster, etc.",2
Just do the Lex origin please,3
I don't know what to feel about it.,2
Great.   I do think that it's unlikely they'll be able to make a sequel that matches this first one *but* even if it does end up being bad or mediocre the first movie is still completely standalone and who knows....it could be good.,2
Just make this one another kind of origin story take cues from Goodfellas and do a killing Joke like origin for joker. Or maybe do raging Bull Bane movie,2
Crossing my fingers for the WB origin story next.,2
"I know a lot of people wanted this to just be a single movie with no sequels, but it would be a crime to deprive the world of more Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. He‚Äôs too iconic.",2
I'm gonna say some unpopular shit here but I'm ok with a sequel and I hope they do as many of those joker movies as they can as long as they have good story ideas.  I'm kinda ok with joker staying in his own parallel universe away from the justice league and all that. In a live action setting sure he can fuck with batman by exploiting his moral code but nowadays theres no reason batman cant just call up flash or supes and joker would be put away or dead in seconds.,2
we only got to see Heath as the Joker once....and now people are mad we get to see another great Joker more than once?,2
"More DC Origin / Standalone movies? Yes  Another one from Todd Phillips? Yes, he earned it.  But i want to see other directors visions aswell. Open the DC Black Label movies up to everyone who has a great pitch and make clever decisions. And dont over saturate the market, aim for 1 unique DC Black label movie like every 2 years or so and keep it fresh.",2
When Todd Philipps went to the WB Studios  [Todd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rkAjnFB1g4),2
This is amazing! I‚Äôve wanted a sequel since the moment I walked out of the cinema. You may argue the film does not ‚Äòneed‚Äô a second movie but I just cannot get enough of Joaquin‚Äôs portrayal. I‚Äôm so excited!,2
"calling it now, a rated R Spider Jerusalem origin movie.",1
I don‚Äôt know how I feel about this to be honest.,1
"I‚Äôm all for it. If they think they have a good idea for a sequel, I‚Äôll trust them.",1
"I have no idea what they'll do in part 2, but if Joaquin Phoenix is willing to return, it has to be good. We all know he's picky with his scripts",1
Would you like to see a Joker 2 or birth of a Dark DC movie franchise that ties several character arcs over different movies into a Marvel style series.  Joker is job done for me. No need to rinse and repeat. I feel I got closure with the character because we know after the end it‚Äôs high entropy. He‚Äôs unpredictable so anything can happen.,1
"So I guess they'll go for a 90s vibe this time?  If the Batman movies are also set in the 90s, it'll be interesting to see two versions of 90s Gotham, one from the perspective of the Joker and one from that of Batman.  Also wonder what kind of designs they'll go for. Maybe Batman goes for a neo noir Gotham while Joker goes for a slightly updated version of the previous movie's colourful design.",2
"A Joker film developed, released and a sequel green lit all within a year and a half while Henry Cavill is practically begging for a direct sequel to 2013's MoS. Comedic is an understatement.",2
This should have been left alone. Joker may have been a quality movie but the controversy surrounding the movie is what propelled it to a billion. It became a cultural necessity to see. It will be very hard for a sequel to replicate that kind of success.,1
"I mean hey, The Godfather 2 was great. Sequels can work. I just hope Phillips and Phoenix have the same passion as the first one",1
"Not going to complain at all. But if they're going to give continuity the Phoenix's Joker, they may as well just tie it into pattinsons batman. Joker is movie of the year and just creating another joker for Pattinson's batman universe would be kind of silly to me.",1
Mixed feelings about 'sequel'. It really felt like amazing standalone movie.,1
President Lex Luthor movie? Let's go!  Darkseid as a gang leader in the mob? Hold up...,1
doesn't sound a good idea. i think joker plays as a one off. although joaquin is one of them actors who i try and catch all their films so i'd definitely watch a sequel.,1
"Oh my fucking god, this news improved my day to 500%",1
"There should be a psychological and courtroom drama based on Two-Face, a tragic techno-thriller based on Mr. Freeze, and a Horror-Suspense film based on Scarecrow.",1
"God damnit , they couldn‚Äôt leave it alone could they",2
Respectuflly dislike the idea.,1
"This is a bad idea, we don‚Äôt need a sequel for this movie ffs",1
1 word:  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2
"If this was all on the studio pushing a sequel, I would be very wary. However, given both Phillips & Phoenix have been talking up a sequel, I am much more into it.  As for other films, that is something I am completely onboard for. Luthor would seem like an obvious choice and could make for an interesting companion piece to Joker. Luthor's rich & powerful POV to Joker's poor and powerless POV.",1
"IMO The Joker movie never seemed like an origin story for The Clown Prince of Crime. The origins of an average mentally unstable killer, sure, but not ""The Joker"" of DC fame. This Joker never seemed to show/have the maniacal intelligence that Joker is known for. Batman is supposed to be the greatest detective and Joker is supposed to be his greatest foe. I can't see Joaquin's Joker as being anything near that. A sequel would have to have Batman in it or else accept that he's not in his league. If Batman is added this Joker's intelligence level would have to skyrocket and it would drastically change the character portrayed in Joker. Joker sequel shouldn't happen. IMO",1
"I don't understand the sentiment that a bad sequel would tarnish the legacy of the first movie! A lot of classic movies had terrible sequels, but they're still considered classics.  Joker introduced a lot of problems in our society but it didn't offer any solutions, that could be an interesting topic for sequel. Or they could make an Arkham asylum movie inspired by 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest' (credit to random redditor).",1
Batman vs 70 years old Joker: THE MOVIE,1
God dammit.,1
Mixed feelings about this one,1
"You know on one hand I think a sequel is totally unnecessary, but man the idea of them showing bruce turning into batman and joker escaping the mental hospital then them somehow crossing paths makes me want a sequel.",1
"If they do another joker movie, I hope they go the multiple choice option for the jokers origin and do a different story.",1
"I hate this news as much as the next guy, but consider this, the sequel doesn't have to include Batman. In fact, this is a perfect opportunity for a Harley Quinn origin movie in disguise. Like, the first one is about a broken man gets beaten down by mental illness and Gotham. The sequel should be about that very monster that Gotham deserves, so a victim is a MUST!  And who fits that shoes better than Harley Quinzel? Seeing an innocent woman be slowly manipulated into a criminal path fills with abuse is so so much more real and brutal than seeing a billionaire dresses like a bat. And not like we ain't having a Batman movie in 2022 (or 2021 idk). Plus, Margot Robbie has a crush on Phoenix so seeing them together on big screen will be a damn bless.",1
I just want a Joker in the Pattinson universe  He doesn't have to be a main villain just yet but I think he should be in that universe,1
I say a good villain origin movie would be Mr Freeze.  I could totally see it.,1
"Imagine a gritty Barton Mathis/Dollmaker movie. That would be intense. Now that I think about it, I could see Rob Zombie directing that one.",1
Can we start a new hashtag to *not* approve a sequel and instead work on more standalone films that dont necessarily have to be interconnected.,1
Perhaps Harley Quinn can be involved in the sequel and a proper rendition of their relationship can be depicted rather than the romanticized version we got in Suicide Squad.,1
"A Todd Philips DC cinematic universe would be akin to something Christopher Nolan would have done.  I had heard, though, that Nolan's scenario was the other way around.  WB asked him to oversee a DC universe of films and television, and he turned it down.  I feel like if WB was smart (and they're not) they would build off of what Phillips just established, even if Phillips steps away.  Hire writers and directors that share that same vision, and then build out a DC cinematic universe that not only stands in stark contrast to the MCU, but is great on its own merits.  But the cynic in me says that'll never happen.",1
idk. Not sure if I am a fan of this tbh. I really liked that this was just a one off standalone feature. And personally I am really sure where they can even go with a  sequel without batman around. I am also not sure I am totally convinced Todd and capture lightning in a bottle once again...,1
Wasn't this a lie though,1
This is such great news. For all we know though the sequel could be more of a retelling of a different origin story.. I mean this is the Joker. As for new characters.. Luthor.,1
Insert,1
"Lex Luther , mr freeze , 2face , scarecrow ?   Who else y‚Äôall want?",1
I'm down for the Rogues movie,1
"Now that Phillips came out and said its all bullshit, can we lock these away?",1
A film toted as a one-off project now getting a sequel after becoming the first rated R movie to cross a billion dollars at the box office?   This really says a lot about our society.,1
"When I saw that finale shot of Bruce standing over his parents bodies I knew it, I just did. PHOENIX WILL FACE BATTINSON down the road.",0
But Joaquin Phoenix never would do a sequel,1
If they do a sequel with no Batman than there is absolutely no point at all,1
At this point I look forward to whatever he want. I'm just keeping my mind open and my body ready.  #BRING ME VANDAL FUCKING SAVAGE,1
"Lol Grace Randolph was right. She said this would happen, but she said they would announce it after the Oscar awards show.   Good for Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix! I hope Zazie Beetz comes back too.",0
"Just let Todd direct the Batgirl movie please and thank you  Edit: imagine a movie about her transition from Batgirl to Oracle, that would fit all the dark and more realistic approach that Todd wants",0
"""You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.""",0
Joker 2 would need a Batman in my humble opinion.,0
"In a perfect world, Joaquin Phoenix would be Jared Leto's replacement",0
"Joker was good, but I think time and money should go into the DCEU. I don‚Äôt want a ton of films about villains when we don‚Äôt have Green Lantern or Flash.",0
"Another DC Villan Origin movie by Todd Phillips, YES.  Sequel to JOKER, NO",0
"https://collider.com/joker-2-sequel/   From August 22nd..   > ‚ÄúOne thing I will tell you: I would do anything with Joaquin, any day of the week,. There‚Äôs nobody like him. If he was willing to do it, and if people show up to this movie, and Warners came to us and said, ‚ÄòYou know what? If you guys could think of something‚Ä¶‚Äô Well, I have a feeling that he and I could think of something pretty cool.‚Äù",3
Chilllllll,3
There is no way to improve upon Cold cold heart.  I don't think remaking a story already on TV is worth his time.,3
Trueeeee,2
"Tbh i think an Arkham Asylum movie could be perfect especially now since they could incorporate Joker into it for a smaller role along with other villains. I get excited just thinking of a film that houses all these iconic villains together in a single dark & gritty location.   (Spoiler alert)  Not sure if that was supposed to be an early version of Arkham Asylum at the end of Joker but i found it interesting that he is locked away in this place that was bright white everywhere almost resembling heaven when in fact it is an insane asylum that you normally would picture on the other end of the scale, maybe this was trying to tell us something?",1
Hasta la vista Baby,1
I really hope Todd isn‚Äôt getting overconfident here lol,3
"Lol, I‚Äôm just picturing him kicking open the door of one of the Warner Bro‚Äôs executives and screaming  ‚ÄúGIVE ME ACCESS TO ALL OF THE DC VILLAIN‚ÄôS ORIGIN STORIES NOW!‚Äù",3
Lex Luthor and maybe another one from Batman?,2
Big dick Todd,3
"Damn, so much for the Madhater origin story.",1
"That is exactly what the tweet says, but based on the article, saying he walked away *WITH* vs *from* one or two is more accurate.",1
100% agree. This was an origin story and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm scared a sequel of it will tarnish the whole point of the first movie. I‚Äôm down for Phillips doing an origin for other villains. All standalones.,3
"If Phillips and Phoenix can create another story that has cultural resonance that made the first Joker film hit the zeitgeist, I'm open to it. That said, I also want to see other standalone villain/hero stories",3
"Maybe instead of Joker 2, they could make a Harley Quinn origin movie with JP's Joker",3
Agree. I'm not mad because I  will definitely watch it.   WB: Clowns! We need more clowns!,1
The thing that's gonna allow DC to succeed is allowing talented directors and actors to do WHATEVER they want. I know that both Phillips and phoenix both wanted this. That passion will show through on the screen just like in the first,2
"""If I'm going to have a past I'd prefer it to be multiple choice""    What if the sequel is another joker origin story but completely different circumstances. I'd watch a JP Joker origin story every 5 years if I could lol.",1
"I agree. It feels very much like a standalone film and that's how it should be. As much as I'd love to watch Phoenix again, I feel that the sequel might dilute this.",1
Came here to say this.,1
"Disagree. As much as I enjoyed the film, I left thinking, -if this Thomas guy's last name was Johnson or Williams in stead of Wayne, this would be just crazy some dude's story"". I need to see this ""Joker"" be *the* joker.",1
There's those rumours where it's about a crazy business man who lives in a world where Superman is a fictional character........ cause sure.... exciting.,1
"This is the biggest thing here. Any other actor, and I‚Äôd be nervous, but I trust his judgement. He‚Äôs not a money grab type of actor, he has to truly like the work he‚Äôs devoting his time to. If he feels it‚Äôs worth it for a sequel than I‚Äôm excited.",2
He just made the most successful film of his entire career. I‚Äôm sure that billion dollar box office could change anyone‚Äôs mind.,3
Chill out. They didn't accidentally make a great movie.,3
"Given how cautious he is with his roles, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd do it unless he knew the story was good enough",2
"Deathstroke standalone film is such a good, we should have got one by now",2
Let's not drive this in any deeper.,1
"You know, I always said that is how it could be like. Im glad there are others out there that share that same idea.",1
Is that possible without Superman/Superboy?,1
"Man of Steel didn't even make 3x the budget, while Joker made over about 18x",1
Meh of Steel was a flop,0
Lex Luthor is the only thing that really makes sense. Only real character that has a name. You could easily ground the character and to have to make a $100M movie.  You just need a serious actor with some chops and clearly a fantastic script.,1
"Hey, WB didnt go looking for a sequel. Phoenix and Phillips wanted a sequel.",3
"I mean, to be fair the Joker doesn't fight Batman physically and in the Arkham games (one of the best versions) he's around 50.",1
It's canon in the comics now that Joker might not age.  The final scene with the therapist is likely 20+ years in the future and Arthur looks the same.,1
I'm hoping it's called Joker & Harley with exactly this.,1
What do you get when you cross a one-off project with a billion dollars? You get what you deserve!,2
No he wont.,2
>Grace Randolph was right. She said this would happen  You needed Grace Randolph to tell you that a studio would do a sequel to a movie that made a billion dollars?,3
So she wasn‚Äôt right.,1
It's not going to happen. He's getting Joker Sequel and probably Lex Luthor/Penguin.,1
"As someone who also did not enjoy Joker, I'm actually sort of optimistic about this.  IMO what the film really lacked was a ""punishment"" for Arthur. We see his rise, but none of the downfall that he deserves. If this sequel is capable of showing just how much of a **weak, pathetic loser** Arthur is, it may actually make me retroactively appreciate the original more.",0
You know I never get people like you. What are you looking for ? Attention? That you found the movie bad is fine but to to think that one fo the most successful comic book movie of all of time shouldn‚Äôt get a sequel because YOU thought it was bad. Don‚Äôt you see how moronic it comes off?,2
Lol says joker was bad but post on Marvel subs every day  EDIT: Grown man posting pics of Millie Bobby Brown. Pedo alert,2
Wasn't that Heart of Ice?,2
He‚Äôs not going to get JP quality of actors for every movie...,3
">After JOKER opening weekend, Todd Phillips went to WB and **demanded** access to origin stories of **ALL** the DC villains   That should tell you all you need to know.",3
"Well fortunately for us, he has a great record of making a good movie and then following it up with the Hangover 2 and 3...",2
Looks like he has already forgotten about Hangover sequels.,1
"-DO IT, OR THERE'S NO MOVIE!!!  -Dude, your movie is already on theaters....",2
"Luthor's upbringing was pretty grim if I recall.  I do love the fact that he became president of the DCU for a while, despite being a disgraced businessman with criminal leanings. Would today's general public buy a storyline that crazy? ü§î",1
"Plus, a sequel would inevitably answer the biggest question that was left unanswered at the end, which I feel was kind of a big point of the movie.",2
"The thing is, Phoenix won‚Äôt take up the role again unless they *are* able to do that. He‚Äôs notorious for not doing sequels and has said the only way he‚Äôd take up the role again is if they could come up with an interesting enough follow up. He‚Äôs not in it for the money.",3
"I‚Äôve been trying to think about SOMETHING they could follow up this particular Joker story with, because I really don‚Äôt think Batman would work, and I couldn‚Äôt conceptualise much of anything.  Through too many hours of deliberation, I came to the same idea myself, and I really like it.  A new perspective on Arthur, via Harleen, and have the movie be an origin for Harley. Similar to Fincher‚Äôs Mindhunter series, it‚Äôs Harleen‚Äôs story interspersed with interviews with Arthur, until, towards the end, mirroring the first film, the protagonist embraces their new, warped identity.",3
If Phoenix is in it then it‚Äôs a sequel  Also Margot Robbie owns that role. I know it‚Äôs an elseworlds but i doubt they‚Äôd go that route.,3
"Yes, they could take inspiration from the Harleen comic by Stjepan Sejic",1
"He was offered the role for Dr. Strange and was gonna act in avengers also. He declined that. Its more than just money. He said he loved being the joker and what they can do next with this character.   If he really wanted money, he wouldve gone to disney.",3
(As long as they have a back end cut of the profits),1
Phoenix hates doing franchises though. He has never done a sequel.,1
>They didn't ~~accidentally~~ make a great movie.,0
Also backed by a truck full of money.,1
"If you think Joker sequel has nothing to do with the kind of money it made, well thats just naive.",1
"Until Deathstroke appears as a major villain in a cinematic release, I'm not sure he could do what *Joker* did at the box office.",1
Well people said joker wasn't possible without batman. Venom wasn't possible without Spiderman and here we are both movies outcrossing the main hero movies,3
"Cavill wouldn't play Superman in that movie if it was only a cameo. He's already had that discussion with WB. He wants more of his own movies, and I agree.  You could do the modern Luthor origin, where he's from Suicide Slums. Set it pre-Superman, with Luthor's ascent to king of Metropolis, and feature a prying Lois Lane as his foil.",1
Didn‚Äôt stop DC from announcing BvS while MoS was still in theaters,1
Dont be silly.,1
"Man of steel was great, well worth a sequel of its own",1
WB decides whether to greenlight it or not.  Todd wanted access to all DC characters lmao.,1
And Joaquin's Joker is unusually strong.,2
> o be fair the Joker doesn't fight Batman physically   Joker fights Batman physically like all of the time what are you talking about?,0
Joker in the comics is also full of toxin that changed his DNA.  Arthur is just a random dude that wears clown make up and so happened to be called Joker a couple times.,1
The final scene is Arthur in the asylum right after the police arrested him so no.,1
You‚Äôll see.,0
Grace Randolph fanatics are something else. Always giving her credit for doing nothing while ignoring the numerous times that she has been wrong about things. I just block them and move on.,3
"Well tbh, its not like the studio went to Phillips for sequel.  Phillips and Phoenix wanted a sequel",1
Tell me anyone else in the media who was saying it with receipts. I think announcing it early hurts Joker's Oscar chances.,0
Attention. He has no talents or anything remarkable to his name. He sees successful people and resents them. It‚Äôs all he has. ‚ÄúFuck their successful I don‚Äôt like it‚Äù,2
"You're probably right, cold cold heart was the Batman Arkham DLC with the same story.",2
Joaquin is one of a kind. But I believe he can get damn close with Bryan Cranston as Lex or something like that.,3
"After all the money the joker made, it‚Äôs not gonna be hard to get actors to sign up lol",2
Ed Helms as The Riddler.,2
"Philips‚Äô comments on ‚Äòwoke culture‚Äô post-release make me think he totally fluked his way through Joker, with Joaquin Phoenix doing about 80% of the work (and Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir doing 15% of the rest). Without them, I don‚Äôt have much faith in Philips‚Äô storytelling vision.",2
He will if he gets Bryan Cranston for Lex Luthor,0
"We'll that's literally how he ended up with joker. He pitched an entire label, but ended up getting a movie.  https://lrmonline.com/news/joker-todd-phillips-pitched-the-dc-black-label-to-wb-and-they-told-him-to-calm-down/",3
"Where'd you get that quote from? That's not in the article at all. It says he proposed to develop a portfolio of DC characters. Not demanded, and not all of them. And not only villains.",2
Sometimes studio interference is necessary.  Letting a director run riot is a stupid thing to do.,2
As have we all,1
"He probably has. If you look at his track record, the Hangover sequels are the only sequels he's done. It's pretty obvious he was just offered a boat load of cash to do those, which is probably why the effort in them was a lot lower.",1
"They can pull something close to House of Cards with naughty political and familiar drama, with Clark maybe doing a 1:1 interview with him but no Superman or Lex Armour.",1
"Which is the only reason I feel confident in this sequel. I didn‚Äôt think anyone would be able to get Phoenix to play a comic book role, but they did it. If the story for the sequel is good enough to get Phoenix on board then I will be very excited for this.",2
"Damn, that could actually work. Solid idea.",1
"Yeah people reacted negatively towards Leto that‚Äôs why WB let Joker happen imo. If Birds of Prey turns alput to be good, I don‚Äôt think we will see other Harleys.",1
"Phoenix does not hate doing franchises. By his own admission, his reason for no sequels is ""no ones asked me"". When asked if he'd ever take on franchise roles, he said he's open to the idea because he does in fact enjoy blockbuster films, but said at the time no one had a script he liked enough.",3
sure but give us an argument?,1
Phillips didn‚Äôt get paid upfront for those movies. He got a percentage of the box office gross. Same with this film.,2
"What joker did at box office is just exceptional , I don't even except the sequel to perform that good",1
Venom did not outgross either recent Spider-Man movie.,1
Venom was shit...the audience was just confused and thought it was spider-man lol I‚Äôve never watched a movie walking away saying ‚Äúthat was such a non movie it didn‚Äôt need to exist‚Äù,0
"Wut. Are you serious?  The Joker in 95% of the cases doesn't know how to fight. Either Romero, Nicholson, Ledger, Hamill or in most of the comics. He just gets punched in the face. In hand to hand combat, he doesn't stand even 2 minutes against Batman.  Did you notice how the Joker isn't a proper boss (even when he was on Titan) in the Arkham games despite being the main villain?   You just punch him.  A physical Batman villain is Bane or Deathstroke.",1
"Based on the New 52 endgame story, it appears he was the joker before he fell into that vat.  They are possibly going to explain it in the 3 Jokers story. I'd still say there is enough mystery behind the character that having him not age in the movie is completely fine.",1
"It's implied it is after Bruce becomes Batman, that is the whole ""you wouldn't get it"" joke. The joke is about Joker creating Batman.",0
How? Reeves has all creative control over it. Studios cant interfere. That was the only reason they were able to get him to direct batman. He initially declined it because WB wanted to interfere in his work.,2
"Grace: when you make contact with water you will get wet  Fanatics jumping in pool: man grace was right , I didnt think it would happen.   The rest of us: the fuck?",2
"These are probably the same people who has very little remaining common sense and had to ask her if *Black Panther* will have a sequel, or had to ask for her ""reviews"" on movies because they've gone too lazy and stupid to judge movies on their own accord.  ""Review pleeeease! Reaction pleeeeease!""   For fucks sake.",2
Everyone and their mama was talking about a sequel post opening weekend. Even Joaquin and Todd themselves stances gradually changed they stances ever since Venice.,2
"I always found *Heart of Ice* way more tragic than *Cold cold heart.* Still a very good DLC tho.  About the impossibility to improve it... I thought the same about *Killing Joke* and what Heath Ledger did, but Philips and Phoenix proved it was possible to completely reinvent a story, even if the character already appeared in dozens of movies/series/videogames/comics/etc.  *Heart of Ice* redefined Mr Freeze origin soty and invented Nora. And yet look at what they did with *Night of the Owls: First Snow*. Wether you like the comics or not (I'm still wondering where I stand on this one) it took an interesting spin on the Nora-Victor relationsip.",1
A Lex Luthor movie where he runs for president would be amazing.  Todd Phillips can play alot of subtle parallels with current political scenario.,3
Too old for an origin.,1
I think they‚Äôre aiming for origin films if this tweet is correct,2
Oscar Issac for Ra's Al Ghul origin story.,2
Cranston and Billy Zane were always my top picks for Lex Luthor. Would‚Äôve enjoyed them a million times more than Eisenberg,2
he can get DiCaprio?,1
"For fucking sure. Like I am super glad The Joker was a really good movie that critiqued class structures and mental health stigmas, but I don't even know if Todd Phillips was aware of THAT, considering how he responded to shit.",2
"Those comments made me think the opposite, considering he is right.",3
"Is he an incel? I though Joker was weird with how it seemed to demonize the right wing (Trump-esque, social-program-slashing figure as the villain) while also lionizing the right wing (making an incel shooter the sympathetic figure).",1
Lawrence Sher deserves at least 10 percent.,1
I agree.I don't think he's a bad director but I don't think he's amazing and I totally thibk Joaquin Phoenix elevated the script and direction a lot.,1
"And WB SHOULD know this by now after almost 30 years. They have a habit of letting directors have free reign on sequels to successful movies which gave us films like Batman Returns, Batman & Robin, and DoJ.   I should note though, Batman Returns and DoJ are somewhat guilty pleasures for me. I always like to label Batman Returns as a bad Batman movie, but a fantastic Tim Burton movie.",1
That‚Äôs perfect.,1
Not at the same time. Not when deep down they want a shared universe with a massive film (you can‚Äôt convince me this isn‚Äôt their end goal),3
I mean what are we doing here. Double casting roles for non cannon origin stories on top of whatever the DCEU is doing?,1
"Just use Margot, Harley 8s like dcs Deadpool",1
"its good (and joaquin is amazing) but highly derivative and flawed in a number of ways. should be like 80%, maybe 85%, on rt. clearly no masterpiece. phillips simply isn't a good enough director/creative talent to pull off something this ambitious.",0
He‚Äôs getting a truck full of money either way from the studio.,1
Pretty straightforward what I said. What are you confused about?,0
I know it was absolute garbage but audience reception was good and it made as much as MCU Spiderman movie,2
Venom was incredibly successful.,2
venom isnpratically a hero origin movie,1
"Venom wasnt shit, i loved that it didnt need spiderman",1
"It's implied because is your head canon, not the reality.",1
Or what if Matt Reeves is also interested in incorporating Joaquin Phoenix joker in his movie (2nd-3rd film),1
"> Phillips   > subtle  Um. *Joker* is many things, but subtle it ain't.",3
There would be nothing subtle about that,3
Y‚Äôall have absolutely no creativity,2
"Agree to disagree, that sounds really boring to me.  If I wanted to see that, I‚Äôd watch a political film. We‚Äôve *never* seen Luthor fight Superman in a mech suit, I think we should see a fully realized Luthor before getting a ‚Äúreal world‚Äù version.",3
Comic book movies are never subtle,1
Yeah and he said he didn't want to have a conversation about the movie. That he just wanted to make it but a movie who touched these themes does that to start a conversation and make people think. Makes me think he lucked into it,1
"He is not even close to right, comedy right now in film and TV is much stronger than it was 15 or 10 years ago.",1
The fact that shows like Fleabag and Barry were aired and received incredibly well this year proves  that woke culture isn‚Äôt the death of comedy. It just means you have to try a bit harder than just dick jokes.,3
Except he‚Äôs not right and you‚Äôd have to be blind and not watch any comedies to even think otherwise.,1
!00% correct,1
> Not at the same time.   There is currently a Phoenix and a Leto (who is having his Joker returning in Birds of Prey).,1
"thanks for giving your opinion, i think its a great movie, exactly what it was needed for it to be",1
"Umm... no? No he‚Äôs not. If the sequel to Joker comes out and it totally bombs, he walks away with nothing.",1
Successful doesn‚Äôt mean good.,0
"Exactly, it did well. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good. Common movie goers saw it as spider-man and that‚Äôs what they were hoping for",0
First movie is coming out 21. The 2nd or third movie isn‚Äôt coming until 2023/2025. I doubt Phoenix will wanna be joker 4-6 years from now.,1
"Didnt say that Joker had subtle themes.   However, A lex luthor movie pointing it's fingers directly at US politics might bring unnecessary controversy.  Todd Philips can explore that grey area where he can include some good criticism on politics without taking sides.",3
"yeah, lets get someone else for a potential Lex movie please. Joker is great but you need a little more nuance for a Lex-running-for-president story",2
Just stated my opinion.  I'm not the one writing the script.,1
Elseworld Lex Luthor story like Joker wont be delling with one-on-one fights with superman where Luthor dons a mech suit.  It would be more of an ideological clash.   Lets reserve the classic Lex Luthor vs Superman rivalry in DCEU.  :),2
>Luthor fight Superman in a mech suit  We won't be getting that in Black Label but I hope it happens in DCEU.,1
Those show sucks,0
"Joaquin, Jared Leto (barely), who‚Äôs the third? The guy from Gotham?",1
The first Joker made enough money for him to not worry about what happens with the sequel.,1
"Common moviegoers loved it. That‚Äôs why it did well. They weren‚Äôt tricked, you buffoon",1
"That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm trying to say. My point is, DC/WB really shouldn‚Äôt be telling Elseworlds versions of stories they haven‚Äôt even told properly yet.  Hell, THE FLASH doesn‚Äôt even have a movie yet! He‚Äôs one of the most iconic superheroes ever!",2
"A lot of people disagree with you, and given that comedy is subjective I would say that the feelings of the majority do matter here, insofar as comedy not being ‚Äòdead.‚Äô",2
"I think he‚Äôs referencing the comics. As of Darkseid War it‚Äôs been revealed that there are three Jokers, which will be explored in an upcoming miniseries",2
Your logic is broken,0
You can say without a doubt people like shows like 'fleabag' more than previous comedic eras?,1
I think you mean my logic doesn‚Äôt line up with what you wish to be true.,1
"have you tried replacing the ball peg for Batman? It improves his torso articulation, and fixes his height issue",1

"Personally, I don't think a Lex Luthor movie would find the same success. Joker worked because of his huge appeal to mainstream audiences and pop culture. Lex Luthor doesn't seem to be at that level. That said, personally it would be great to see a political or rise to power movie starring Lex Luthor.   For what it's worth, I think the only villain that could work as well in his own movie would be Darth Vader.",3
"If we‚Äôre doing his early days and building LexCorp then a mixture of Steve Jobs and Social Network.   If we‚Äôre doing his later years as President then a mixture of All The President Men, Frost/Nixon and Vice.  EDIT: Honestly, there so much you could with Luthor character study film and you don‚Äôt really even need Superman. Just have Clark appear from time to time as a reporter.",2
"I actually think it would be cool if instead of doing a Joker 2, Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips do a Luthor movie. I think Joaquin would phenomenal as Lex.",2
"I could see it being about a man who wants everything yet feels as though he can never attain it all.  A good chunk of the movie should show his childhood and why he acts the way he does, taking inspiration from Smallville by showing his complicated relationship with his father.  Over the course of the movie, he gains more and more power, going from a genius stuck in Kansas to a CEO of a fortune 500 company to the damn president. However, he's always followed around by the mild-mannered Clark Kent.  Even though Lex has much more than Clark, he still can't help but be jealous, thinking there's something Clark's hiding, some secret to how Clark has what he considers a happy life. I don't think we would really see Superman on-screen but it is left ambiguous if aliens do exist in this world or if Luthor's just going insane",2
Yeah I would totally be down for this,1
"Thinking sort of like The Accountant + drawing out or dealing with societal phenomenons of the ""privileged white male"" and ""mentally/emotionally/physically abused children turned into adults"" (just like JOKER did with mental illness) + sort of doubling down on the mystery political psychological thriller.   Synopsis? A disturbed man on the pursuit of power at any cost. His demons slowly consume him as he finds success and potential in every opportunity. Man-turned-machine-- the path of becoming heartless.   Imagine a world where a man constantly warned his people of the coming of aliens-- yet they laugh in his face-- and comes what they believe to be the fall of man and the rise of extraterrestrial power-- of which the man so wants. I'd also be down if they gave it a sub plot where Martian Manhunter (but disguised or shapeshifted into a political candidate-- ordinary human being) would be Lex Luthor's political opponent-- where Lex constantly treated his nemesis as ""an alien""-- sort of have the movie build up to his introduction to the Superman as well if WBs is feeling bold.",1
Would love to see the question as the antagonist,1
I feel like it would be a Silicon Valley version of Taxi Driver.,1
Get Aaron Sorkin to write the script. That would be so perfect,1
I'd imagine something like the Wolf Of Wall Street with some Smallville mixed in.,1
Citizen Kane with House of Cards elements,1
"Political thriller, most likely. Think All the Presidents Men, except if Nixon was even more unhinged.",1

"Honestly, DC Black doesnt even need to be all dark movies. It can be simply an experimental brand for many different characters. With stories that stand alone, for writers and directors with a great vision. It can go from Drama, Comedy Thriller, Social Commentary, Period Piece, Coming of age film. Find the right character, the right creative team and a story that is worth telling and you can create so many different, interesting  things.",3

I can't help but see my gear shifter when I look at that cowl,1
This is hardcore!!,2
This is one of the few fan arts of Pattinson in the cowl that actually looks good. Very nice.,2
Unpopular opinion: I didn‚Äôt have a problem with that line. It fit with Batfleck‚Äôs dry humor.   It‚Äôs leagues better than ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt.. not..‚Äù which was an abomination.,3
#STOP,2
In the cowl he always looks good. When they photoshop the body is always kinda mediocre. He‚Äôs face fits perfect with almost every cowl especially because of his chin.,2
"I still have a problem with that line because Bruce is known to be extremely stubborn about his injuries or being in pain in the comics.   A much better scene would've been if Diana tried to help Bruce up and asks if he's alright. Bruce, being the stubborn bastard he is, angrily knocks her hand away and gets up on his own, telling her ""I'm fine."" but we see him slightly walk in pain. Cyborg then would quickly scan him as he walks away and say ""Nope, something's definitely bleeding.""",3
"The reshoot joke I find little issue with is ‚ÄúSorry guys, I didn‚Äôt bring a sword.‚Äù I think *that* one fits with the same humor as ‚ÄúI hear you talk to fish‚Äù (the first time when he meets Aquaman. Not the second time in the Batcave). The reason I dislike it is because it was so unnecessarily reshot. It was one line. It replaced ‚ÄúMy turn...‚Äù which, I think was an awesome line. So while it works, I think it was an unnecessary reshoot. It didn‚Äôt change anything in the movie except what‚Äôs said in those 3 seconds.",2
"""I don't...not.."" Is pretty bad.   But I have a much weirder time with the ""Fawning over Clark open-mouth, smiling, bro-crush"" that Affleck was coached into filming. At 1:39;28, he's smiling away like a love-sick goofball. It doesn't make me dislike Batfleck, overall but it's hard to reconcile that with BvS.   Unpopular: I love BvS and JL and Green Lantern and Joker.",2

I would love to see a  Victor Freeze origin story.,3
Yes but I'd also prefer one that leaned more into the fantastical comic-booky feeling of the comics rather than a more realistic take,1
Only if it's actually canon to the current DC film universe so that we can get a super fleshed out Scarecrow to take on an establish Batman.  Instead of a side pocket universe that can't ever cross over with either the 'DCEU' or the Reeves Batman (which may be its on stand alone series).,1
I'd be down for it. Jonathan Crane is just as bat shit crazy as the joker is.,1
"Maybe? I feel like it be too easy to make it very close to Joker though.   Also, if all Batman‚Äôs major Rogues, Scarecrow is the most 2 Dimensional. There isn‚Äôt a lot of depth to him, unlike Riddler, Joker, Freeze, hell even Penguin.",1
"I was saying on another post how i think an Arkham Asylum movie would be perfect more then ever now, they would be able to showcase most of the major Batman villains during the film and hopefully even bring back Joker for a smaller role during it.",2
I always thought his would be the saddest to tell. I would love to see Victor to get his chance at redemption for a live action movie after the abomination that was Batman and Robin. He is such a great character.,2
I think DC does better with these more realistic interpretations then fantastical ones because it makes their movies stand out from Marvel.,1
"Well I, for one, hope he'll be back.....................................................",1
"Depends on the characters. Batman and most of his allies and rogues fit into realism pretty well. Just about any other DC character with mystical/alien/voodoo powers, probably not as much.",1

"For real tho, I'll never understand why WB hasn't committed to it...how can they be scared of losing money on a DVD release when it's still trending on social media nearly 2 years after the theatrical release.",3

Saving it for HBO Max,2
"They‚Äôll probably just call it the Director‚Äôs Cut, just because that‚Äôs what it is.",0
I don't care if it costs 200 bucks. Just release that shit already GODDAMMIT,0
Because the film probably needs an investment to finish special effects and they probably have already taken a big enough financial loss on the film and the embarrassment that ensued that they don‚Äôt wanna deal with it anymore.,3
Because you're assuming all those people are going to buy the movie just because they RT'd the hashtag. Currently Wonder Woman is the highest selling DCEU movie DVD/Blu-Ray wise and it only received 115M+ in sales since 2017. BvS has only made around 80M in sales and JL even less. WB profiting off TSC to the point where it would offset their losses from the theatrical cut is very slim.  Also all these numbers come from [https://www.the-numbers.com](https://www.the-numbers.com),3
"Last time WB threw money at JL to make money it went sour, you want them to do that again? Honestly, they should sell it digital only to maximize profits, why the hell would they bother with a physical DVD release?",1
They made $1 billion off Joker... The reported $40 million needed to finish the film is just 4% of that,1
They would need millions of dollars in pre sales to justify it,1
"This is the best idea, there's no way WB is gonna waste the time and money to have a physical release. They'll either drop it on HBO Max or sell it on YT/Prime/GooglePlay etc",1
They have money. They‚Äôre just  a bunch of dumb greedy bastards is all. Hopefully they listen and release it. Everyone wants it,0
"Ah yea, I guess I've never considered that it'd still need to be finished on some levels",1
I doubt it does. Basically everyone from the cast and crew says it's complete.,1
"Put it up on a kickstarter site and watch the fans fund it themselves. No excuses, but not wanting to face the music.",1
"I guess I'm viewing it as a separate issue from the theatrical release at this point. But the replies here make me realize it's not nearly as simple as I've thought, I've never considered exactly how much completion a Snyder JL cut would still need",2
"In my mind it'd require negligible $ from WB to make the Snyder Cut itself profitable (Tho I'm 100% talking out my ass here). But yea, you make a good point with digital vs physical dvds",1
Even digital released still require more works unless they let it out raw.  And how embarassing HBO Max look if one of their selling points is a re-edited of flopped film back in 2017 while Disney Plus or Netflix got tons of new original contents.,1
"I don't get why that was a controversial take. Zack is officially (even though we all know it's bollocks) the one and only director of Justice League. They don't need to release a ""Snyder Cut"". They can release a ""Director's Cut"". Which is completely normal and doesn't say ""oh yeah we fucked this film up so we could hit quarterly revenue targets.""",0
"Just because they have money doesn't mean they want to throw a bunch of it away on developing CGI for a director's cut DVD re-release of a movie that already flopped.   > greedy   Well yeah, they're a business what do you expect.   > Everyone wants it   Lol",3
"I mean fans raised 100k for suicide prevention.. which is like.. the salary of 2 custodians at WB headquarters? Fans gonna need to invest a lot more money than they could towards a good cause, if they expect to actually fund the VFX for this movie, it's marketing and re-release..",2
"It cost more to finish vfx, re-editing, sound mixing and marketing...  And I doubt Snyder and those crews that push so hard for their Snydercut are gonna do it for free.",2
"That's not how it works chief.  Every dollar made at a theater gets split between the theaters and the studio/distributers.  In the US that split is rougly around 50/50 but some studios (i.e. Disney) can have the content to muscle a 60/40 split.  In China that split is much worse for the studio - they only get roughly a quarter of that take because the money is also split with theaters and the chinese distributers.  The marketing cost is a real thing, but the tax liability is often different for the studio than it is for direct income off the movie production (because of the external partners involved).  So including marketing, any given movie needs to make approximately 2.5-3x its production budget in order to break even.  JL barely broke 2x and lost money (roughly a $60M loss).",2
"Well this is the reason why WB's flops this year aren't really big loses to them. They've only been covering only a 3rd of the budget or only financing distribution costs just in case the movie bombs.  [https://variety.com/2019/film/news/warner-bros-flops-doctor-sleep-goldfinch-1203400046/](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/warner-bros-flops-doctor-sleep-goldfinch-1203400046/)  ‚ÄúSome are only distribution deals, some are co-financed, so it‚Äôs tough to get a sense of how much skin they have in the game.‚Äù  If WB were to put out TSC, I would think WB would have Snyder's production company and whoever else cover the bill with only WB just releasing  the movie",1
"I've read yhis one article somewhere maybe ScreenRant about why WB don't want to release the Snyder cut.  They said it might be possible WB didn't want to messed up the 'more standalone movies' with the Snyder story (JL part1-5).   like MCU, the story ends in 11 years. maybe they want to extend the DCEU more than that and just go slow.  or maybe they just didn't like Zack Snyder (imo).",1
Others are bringing up a great example like the live action Sonic getting a redesign.,0
 Quite different example‚Ä¶  Sonic redesign is to prevent it from flopped due to huge negative feedback. JL Snyder Cut is about pour more money to finish VFX in order to re-edited one of the biggest disappointment box office 2 years ago which cost WB a lot.  Donner cut is not a great example either because Superman 2 was not a flopped or bad film to begin with.  The good example that you guys are looking for is Kingdom of Heaven where director cut is far better than theatrical released but I doubt Snyder is as good director as Ridley Scott.,2
Source please.  Every breakdown I‚Äôve seen shows that it depends on the movie and no it is not that extreme.  Maybe 65% for the studio in the first 4 weeks for a high end Disney blockbuster and then it gradually tapers to the 50/50 cut afterwards.  But most movies do not have the leverage to cut the theater owners out of the equation for the most lucrative portion of any movie‚Äôs run.,1
What I was referring to was characters receiving a redesign. Neither of the examples you provided did that.,1
"https://celluloidjunkie.com/2017/11/04/disney-can-demand-65-box-office-star-wars-last-jedi/  Not sure what the conditions are for the sliding cut for the 90+% cuts but most articles from reputable sites (Variety, WSJ, Hollywood Reporter, etc) often discuss studio cuts in the 50-65% range.  Edit: Here's another article on studio profit breakdowns: https://deadline.com/2019/10/joker-profit-global-box-office-avengers-1202767490/  By your split percentages and cuts, there doesn't seem to be a scenario where Joker could make as much profit as Avengers Endgame.   I appreciate the source though, sounds like there‚Äôs another side to film rental and distribution that I‚Äôm not aware of.",1

"Haha he‚Äôs a Greek director and actor and he has worked with J.K Simmons in a movie I don‚Äôt remember. Anyway, his movies make a lot of money mostly because he‚Äôs local. Joker easily surpassed Endgame by more than 300.000 tickets in the country. Joker had a similar debacle like in the U.S here so it blew up.",2
Yeah pretty crazy!,1
"I know, I am Greek too. Never understood why he is so successful and how he convinced JK Simmons to be in his film!!! Not even Thanos could beat him!",1
"Because Papakaliatis is Batman too. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Batman, Lego Batman!‚Äù",1
"Well, that explains a lot!!!",1
"Aquaman is an old school style action/adventure with the skin of a modern spectacle. Hell, so is Wonder Woman.",3
Cinematography is really beautiful.   The underwater scenes.  Volcano Ring fight.  Final battle. Arthur vs Orm fight Trench scene. Surface action sequences.  I thought Aquaman would make around 700-800 mil in box office given how low opinion DCEU was having during that time. But the visual spectacle really added alot to the theatrical experience.,2
"Hell yes. Aquaman rules. I find it really sad some people can't enjoy fantastical elements in comic book films anymore unless it pokes fun at itself. It's like people need to be told it's OK to like full-on escapist fantasy again.   I love Aquaman for the same reasons you do. It just goes for, man.",2
"100% agree.  Compared to the more quippy, sarcastic humor of the MCU, Aquaman really brings me back moreso to the humor in the Raimi Spiderman films. It's silly, but it plays the sillyness straight. It isn't a ""haha, look at how dumb we are lolz"" quip. It's more organic. Less ""can a Skrull do that?"", more ""That is a bad outfit!"". Aquaman IMO is one of those films that shows how a big dumb action movie can absolutely relish in what it is rather than try to be self-referential. That worked fine for something like GotG1 or even Thor Ragnorak, but it's been getting used in EVERY MCU movie lately. And it comes across as kinda lazy. To make a game analogy, it's the problem people have with modern Sonic stories. They lack sincerity.  Like you said, Aquaman is SINCERE. And sincere comedy is something sorely lacking in modern CBMs. We get plenty of dark sincere movies, and plenty of light ironic ones, but rarely do we get a light sincere one. Again, it's closer to Raimi Spiderman or Donner Superman than it is Lester or Whedon or Gunn. Are there a few cringe moments? Yeah, but everytime I watch Aquaman I care less and less. Because it's one of those movies like MoS or WW or LotR where even on my 1000th time watching it, I'll see something I never noticed before.  I was hyping up Shazam! over Aquaman for a while, but where Shazam! has been the same level of pretty good everytime I see it, Aquaman has gone from ""eh"" to ""good"" to ""FRIGGIN AWESOME"", and I don't think that will stop. So yeah, Aquaman officially is higher than Shazam! in my rankings. Hell, it's getting dangerously close to BvSUE.  Plus, Jason is just fantastic in the role. He made Aquaman, the laughing stock of DC, into one of the best characters. That's an accomplishment.",3
"Aquaman is on my favourites comic book movies(probably and my favourite if i didnt loved so much psychological films Joker and TDK) because of the one lines,costumes,cgi are straight out of the comics.Hole the sequel feels the same.",1
It was such a blast! I hope the second one is even better!,1
"Couldn't have said it better. I feel exactly the same way. It's just such an old school kind of adventure. Despite being filled with CGI, it has this classic kind of adventure movie vibe I just adore.",2
Aquaman and Shazam were such a breath of fresh air for the DCEU. Embrace the cheese.,2
>Aquaman is great cinema.  Martin Scorsese  Jokes aside I really loved Aquaman. It's a theme park. A rollercoaster. But there's something more inside. In time we'll watch James Wan's Aquaman trilogy the same way we watch SW Original Trilogy.,1
I won't go as far as to compare it to LOTR (no comic book movie has ever come close up LOTR imo) but Aquaman deserves a lot more credit on this sub,1
"Aquaman was an incredibly fun movie, glad to see Wan had so much fun with it. The style of the movie is so typical Wan, with complex movements during action shots which elevates the action so well. The VFX are, of course, fantastic, total bullshit the movie wasn't nominated for best VFX.  I had some gripes with the film, but I'll save those for another time. This is an Aquaman love post and I'll keep my post in that vein.",1
I loved Aquaman. Can't wait for the sequel.,1
"I‚Äôll give it this since you‚Äôre praising it for its uniqueness, making it feel unlike any other movie. I honestly can‚Äôt think of any movie with such a plot-moving character as *insert random explosions*  So eloquently well crafted into the story. Makes the transitions almost seamless.",1
"Aquaman was certainly not a film that I enjoyed, but I‚Äôm glad the movie has made some DC fans happy. It just sucks we can‚Äôt have films like Aquaman AND BvS, though. With the ‚ÄúSnyder Era‚Äù, it felt like we could only have one type of film while post-Snyder feels like we can only get one type of film too...although, perhaps I‚Äôll be proven wrong with darker films in the form of The Batman mixed with lighter films if we ever begin to see a resemblance of a shared continuity.  Excluding Joker simply because it‚Äôs far and away from any DC shared universe.",0
"I wouldn't compare it in a narrative or thematic sense...but for sheer scope and technical craft, I totally would.",1
"Aquaman was a visual spectacle and should have at least been nominated for best VFX, but LOTR is on another level for me",1
"Wow, THR saying one thing and Deadline outright denying it.",3
"Interesting, both credible trades. Waiting for Variety to chime in",3
Oh.. Boy.   This is good drama. Two major publications contradicting each other.,3
https://variety.com/2019/film/news/joker-sequel-todd-phillips-1203410411/  Variety is saying otherwise now.,3
Announcing it now hurts it‚Äôs Oscar chances.,3
Deadline vs THR: Dawn of Trades,3
*Variety posts an article*  THR: Is she with you?  Deadline: I thought she was with you.,2
Pretty sure if Phoenix says no then it won't happen since he said that he only signed up for one film.,2
I really hope it doesn‚Äôt get a sequel. That would completely ruin the appeal of the movie in the first place.,1
"except he did, he even said he did",1
"Vote me in the ""No sequel"" camp. It's perfect as a standlone.  Vote me in the ""Hell Yes!"" to DC:Dark ""Lex Luthor""",1
hallelujah,1
"Lately THR has been very speculative, I only have blind faith on Variety, Vanity Fair, RS or Deadline.  And this makes more sense, because one week after getting released no one knew that the film was going to cross $1B.",1
Why can't both trades just get a simple direct quote i'm so sick of Insiders Say this and that,0
Right? Looks like a little trade war action.,3
I don‚Äôt think Deadline has it right here. Phillips himself has said he pitched multiple DC villain movies to WB when they first spoke about Joker.,2
"While THR is the bigger name, they have demonstrated a willingness to dip into editorial baiting culture now and then. Both are in the cream of the crop category, but they do have differentiating qualities.",3
It's not like they have the same level of validity.  Variety > Deadline > THR  Why this sub thinks otherwise is baffling.,2
Let them fight,3
Sure beats watching nobodies contradicting each other on Twitter. This shit is way more classy.,2
So they're saying he did not meet with WB for other villains but did meet with WB for a Joker sequel. All three trades have conflicting report. This is hilarious.,3
"This Variety article its probably the closer to the truth. Like it says,if a sequel really happens,it will take many years to be made. Because DC has a busy slate but also because they want to make sure it will be on the same level of quality.",1
"While I don‚Äôt disagree with you, any reason as to why that would be the case?",0
"I thought the original rumor was origin stories of the *other* Rogues' Gallery characters. Penguin, Riddler, etc. I'd love to see how they'd pull off Clayface, or Killer Croc. I think the backstory I want - nay, *need* - the most is Condiment King.",1
*THR vs Deadline: Dawn Of Trades*,3
it‚Äôs more of a studio vs trade war.   I think there‚Äôs obviously talks of a sequel but neither WB and Phillips will  announce such thing until after the Oscars. THR probably jump the sharks  hoping that WB will confirm but instead they used Deadline to counter reports. It happen often.,3
Sad!,1
"That was in the beginning though. The movie is out now and made $1b. I think if anything could be certain is that he did go to WB to talk about something now since his movie exceeded box office expectations. One thing I don't want is him running the elseworld movies, WB should be hiring different directors to do their vision.",2
"*cough* ""Fabled Snyder Cut"" *cough*     THR is rather hit and miss with DC stuff honestly.",2
Love Serizawa.,1
"From the Variety article it sounds to me like they called him in and said ""okay, your movie just make a billion dollars. Give us another similar idea and we'll run with it."" and Phillips said ""okay....lemme get back to you on specifics"" because he had nothing in the tank ready to pitch.",2
"It turns it into a ‚Äúfranchise movie‚Äù , which doesn‚Äôt disqualify it but may make it seem less special. I think it mostly hurts screenplay and picture noms. I don‚Äôt think Phoenix‚Äôs performance can be over looked for a nomination at this point.",2
Deadline: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time you learn what it means to have journalistic integrity.‚Äù,3
Deadline to THR: [https://66.media.tumblr.com/65325ba41ca904a31672858e0ca610ac/tumblr\_o0pql5c1291ut763mo1\_500.gifv](https://66.media.tumblr.com/65325ba41ca904a31672858e0ca610ac/tumblr_o0pql5c1291ut763mo1_500.gifv),1
"""Must..save...Scoop..""  ""...why did you say that word!?""",1
That or maybe they're floating the news around to test the waters while using Deadline to give them plausible deniability for either decision.,1
I never put full faith in their work until Variety confirms it.,2
"Yeah, that was straight-up tacky.",2
"That should be the ‚Äúsequel‚Äù though, not a Joker 2 but rather a ‚ÄúThe Riddler‚Äù or something like that, perhaps in a different setting.",3
"This is weirdly something that I hoped WOULDN'T happen. I don't need everything to immediately become a type of franchise. I like the idea of a DC Black label, but in the sense of different auteurs making films in the way they want with no overarching guideline or cohesion.",3
"I wonder what villains they gave him. If I could guess I would say they didn‚Äôt let him touch another Batman villain. My bet is on Lex Luthor, Vandal Savage or even Deathstroke(not a Batman villain)",3
"""demanded""",3
-Bane.  -The Riddler.  -Orm/Ocean Master.  -Ra's Al Ghul.  -Cheetah.  -Lex Luthor.  -Sinestro.  -Star Sapphire.  -Etc.  There's plenty of DC villains that could potentially make for good films with the right director and vision.,3
Would be cool to see a Reverse Flash movie.,3
My bets on two face. Something atleast ganagster or mob related. Imagine if it's that ventriloquist dude?!. I'd actually watch some psychotic old guy lose his head and have an alternate criminal persona led though a puppet. Actually... Would I?.,2
I don't know how to feel about this joker sequel I thought the first movie was fine im glad it happened and I'm glad it made money but this seems like an unnecessary sequel.,3
I have a question.  Do you guys want elseworld realistic origins of DC characters that take away all the comicbook magic?   I just knew if Joker makes money it has to get a sequel.,2
"He should've walked into the room holding a hand grenade and screamed at the top of his lungs for ""the whole fucking DC villain phonebook"". I bet he would've got what he wanted.",1
Lex Luthor is the ONLY name that's recognized and makes sense after Joker.,1
Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter he proposed an outsized idea ‚Äî the rights to develop a portfolio of DC characters' origin stories.  Everyone posting this story needs a reading lesson,2
Mr. Freeze,1
woohoo we get to see Batmans parents get shot again!,1
Riddler please!,1
this dude seems very confident in his abilities lmao,1
"Scare Crow, Clay face and Swamp thing will work",1
Just have the sequel be Joaquin Phoenix playing out a different origin for the joker. Making it multiple choice,1
"He should do Lex because Reeves can take villains for his trilogy without there being multiple iterations running at the same time.  And if they do reboot or continue Supes, I think they can do without Lex.",1
Riddler done like zodiac killer would be awesome.  Lex as a corporate greed drama and the final act you introduce Superman and see Lex go crazy .  Death Stroke as a crime action flick .  Garganta the tale of a tall porn actress gone evil who starts experimenting with a way to become taller. With sexy results . üòâ   mr mxyzptlk the comic book super natural horror movie.,1
Perhaps he could take on an Injustice League film...,1
I would much rather see him do booster gold,1
"Lex would make sense.   Lex and Joker are the top 2 DC villains and the DCEU versions of those two have been.......controversial, to say the least. With Joker now on a high, maybe WB would want Lex redeemed in the public eye.",1
DO SCARECROW!!!,1
"As long as they keep this a side-business and keep making non-R Aquaman, Batman, Wonder Woman etc... go right ahead.  It's clear a large audience wants graphically violent adults-only fare so I can't argue with the box office.",1
"Clayface, in the style of Birdman but less comedic.",1
"Why'd he walk away from one or two if he didn't get what he wanted in the first place ? Either WB said no, or WB did offer him something that he walked away from.",1
Into the Toddverse,1
"I don't understand WB's logic. They didn't have faith in this movie so they only paid 20-30mil which was half the budget. Now, Joker is over a billion and the top rated r movie box office wise. He hit Nolan status. He deserves the chance to work on any of the villains. Besides, they're going to be elseworld movies, so what is the problem?",1
Is the hollywood reporter even a liable source?,0
I was thinking of it being a ripple effect with joker inspiring theatrical villains the way Superman inspires the formation of the JL,3
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Riddler since Reeves has dibs on the character for now.,3
"The other criminals of Gotham probably wouldn't be fans of what The Joker is doing, which is basically just causing a lot of chaos.  The Penguin would offer an alternative.  Crime, with class.  [Peter Dinklage would be perfect for the role.](https://preview.redd.it/t1u3h5mt6qw31.jpg?width=667&auto=webp&s=1c13e6b0c8e500d62c7dd7bf32d3ffa7b8f5e4be)",1
I just wish they made the live action films more like the DC animated movies. They all have great plots.,2
Wasn't Vandal savage Hitler during world war 2?? It would be interesting to see a commentary on Nazis.,3
"How about Mr.Freeze? Show his life before his wife becomes ill and then the struggle to find a cure. Makes you feel for him but then, oh yeah! He's a villain. Might work.",1
eye roll city,3
"a list of villians for a movie not including Mr Freeze , aint nICE.",3
Ventriloquist would actually be so cool. I doubt a film about him would make as much money since he's not as famous as the Joker but I'd still watch the hell out of it,2
Why not? It‚Äôs not as if we‚Äôre not getting classic adaptations as well,2
"What comic book magic is there to the Joker? Or Lex Luthor? Both of them could easily exist in a real world. So long as they know their limits, it'll be fine.",2
Get Bryan Cranston and call it a day.,1
Because not every villain is worthy of their own solo movie. Certainly not ones who pretty much rely on the existence of their nemesis (AKA Lex Luthor),1
Are you new here or being sarcastic?,2
"Oh yeah, I‚Äôm not saying it should be Riddler, that was just one of the first villains I thought of that could be done in a similar way.",2
DANNY IS THE ONLY PENGUIN,1
Agreed. They were spinning gold in their pre-flashpoint films,1
There are crazy story possibilities with Vandal Savage. It might be one of the very few DC villains they could actually make 5 films on.,3
"He wasn‚Äôt Hitler but in at least one adaption (DCAU) he puts Adolf on ice and took over the Third Reich.   When the Justice League beats him, the Germans basically unfreeze Hitler and go back to the way things were.",3
It could be seen as a bit tone-deaf to have the protagonist of a film be an active member of the Third Reich.,1
Pretty cold if you ask me.,2
"That's what the ""etc."" is for, too many to list them all.",2
"I mean, we still haven‚Äôt really gotten a proper classic adaptation of the Joker.",2
We still don‚Äôt have a movie starring The Flash.,1
I think you misspelled pedophile ring that the elites and government are running,1
"Surprised you didn't draw the comparison between Lex and Trump, lol.",1
*RDJ_eyeroll.jpg*,1
"Nah, confused hollywood reporter with Heroic Hollywood, whoops!",2
"Well...protagonist doesn‚Äôt mean hero.    John Smith in Man In The High Castle is a protagonist for the American Reich - the Nazi-occupied portion of the United States.  He is both sympathetic and unsympathetic at the same time - he is a dedicated family man, but he also is a die-hard Nazi...at least from the get-go.  The viewer also follows characters on the Japanese side on their side of the border and they‚Äôre portrayed in a brutal manner as well, gassing Jewish people and gunning people in the street.",0
"Yeah, there are probably a thousand at least.",1
Trump‚Äôs more Bizarro than Lex.  Putin might be Lex.,1
Lex would be deeply insulted to be compared to Donnie. Trump on the otherhand would probably take the comparison as a huge compliment.,1
I cannot disrespect a great fictional character by comparing him with a real life clown,1
"The complaints about McGregor not having his mask for the majority of the movie don't make sense to me. Why can't the movie show his transformation from Roman Sionis into Black Mask? Especially if it completes his character arc in the film itself. Not to mention, him eventually wearing the mask would be a great event in the second or third act of the film.   On top of that, plenty of comic book film's villans have origin stories for the character, where they become the full fledged or final form of the character in the 2nd or 3rd act. And for Black Mask, that actually makes even more sense.",3
Spoilers obviously: >!We will see him wearing a mask and on the 3rd act and he will get burned while wearing the mask!<,2
">There are currently no shots of Ewan McGregor online helming the black mask which leaves a few concerns for me, i think it would be a massive missed opportunity if they only show the character before his accident for the duration of the film.  Hopefully its like Harvey Dent's transformation in TDK",1
Expect Black Mask who doesn‚Äôt wear a black mask for most of the movie and has almost zero associations with his comic counterpart.    This movie is Deadpool for tween girls.  People anticipating anything faithful to the source material need to temper their expectations ASAP.,0
"My only guess is because this is still in the world where Batman has been in the game for decades, so you would think everyone from Penguin to Zsasz to Black Mask to Ratcatcher would have all tussled with him a few dozen times each. At least to the point where all of his usual bad guys should be in or past their prime already as well.",1
"Not only that but i cant seem to understand why people dont understand why Harley is the focus of the marketing when she's the only character the GA know or give a fuck about. Also the complants about Cassandra cain makes no sense. A mute Asian kid who is a master marital artist? Didint we see that in the boys, Logan(minus the Asian part), hell even in suicide squad. It's a stereotype that is just silly to me",0
This is how i hope it is and a previous comment basically confirmed this is the case. Very interested in seeing the transformation and the actual accident then hopefully to round it off we get a few good scenes of Roman in full Black Mask form! can't wait for this movie now.,0
"What i wanted to hear! that comment alone has sold me because his back story has always interested me the most out of all the Batman villains, should be great to see it all play out on screen and hope they make the accident scene brutal. I think Ewan will kill the role as well.",1
"*Begun, the Trade Wars have...*",3
"Some are gonna look real smart, and some are gonna look real dumb when the dust settles. I‚Äôll just be here eatin‚Äô popcorn.",3
"I'm glad, *Joker* was a nice, one off movie.",3
I believe THR over the Wrap,3
Good. Now focus on the cinematic universe. Give me Superman!!!!!,2
Not yet.,2
I am a big fan of the movie and I don't want a sequel.  Turning this one into a franchise feels unnatural.,3
No sequel is needed.,1
Lol THR taking Ls today,2
Honestly...it's better this way. Joker is the kind of movie that should stand on its own.,2
"While the Joker movie is deff best left alone as a one off, I still am under the belief that Joaquin should come back to reprise the role.",1
Why not tackle another villain origin?,1
"There might not be a direct sequel to Joker, but there's no way Warner Bros wont try to capitalize off the success of the film in some way",1
Talks happened. This is hilarious.,1
Good... Joker is not deserve The Hangover treatment.,1
"of course, they dont want to spoil their Oscar hopes by announcing a sequel",1
"It's hard to imagine a sequel would be anything *but* a cash grab.  What more are we going to see? He's the joker now. His transformation was complete as he danced down those stairs. A sequel has like, three shitty options:  It can try to repeat what Joker did. So, re-wind the transformation, undo most of what the first movie did, and just do it again. No thanks, they got it right the first time.  It can be a batman movie, with joker as the villain. Meh? Phoenix's joker was an amazing protagonist, but that was all because of his vulnerability... I have zero interest in following the hero that beats him up. If you give Fleck an army, gadgets or super powers, he loses the human weakness that made him so interesting. Great antihero, shit antagonist.  So, if the Joker stays transformed and stays the protagonist, it kind of needs to be a Joker vs. ___ sort of thing. Almost all of the options there are shitty and dull. I don't want to watch Joker save the city from some greater evil. I'd rather watch Joker vs. some abusive law enforcement type, but that'd still be pretty dull. Joker vs. Batman with Batman as the villain might actually be interesting - Something that shows how Batman shifts in his esteem from a nuisance to a terror to a fascination and mutual obsession - but that's way easier to say than it is to do right, and Aurthur Fleck's Bruce is way too young to make it work.",1
"But snapchat news told me that the sequel was in the works, and they'd never lie",1
Thank you. Move on WB...focus on an interconnected universe if you so desperately want money.,0
"Yep, it should stay a one-off.",3
"I agree. It was a work of art and you cheapen it by making a sequel you had not originally planned to do.   Now if they want to do another hero or villain in that same universe and have Easter eggs back to Joker, fine. But leave the character as he is, don‚Äôt cheapen it.",1
What about deadline?,2
Deadline reported first that it's not in the works so it's more THR vs Deadline/Wrap,1
"Same, but if they‚Äôre going to create a franchise (DC Black or whatever they call it) , I‚Äôd trust Todd as their Feige more than Zack.",0
"It should, but money reigns above all for the studio.",2
That‚Äôs if he wants to. He seems....not comfortable about the real world idolization some people have towards his version of Joker.,1
Like depends if it wins an Oscar or not.,1
"I mean, this movie just had huge profit....",3
This film is more profitable than every single DCEU films...oops,2
"Eh, Joker is proving to WB that they really should not focus on the universe. They tried it and it didn't do well at the box office at all, now all their solo standing films are the ones making real money.",1
"Who even said Zack would even be CONSIDERED?   That's also circumstantially misplaced seeing Tood is just a director-- and would in that case be more of a Jon Favreau-level figure than anything.  Can we stop this whole thing about hypothetically referring to every most recent and acclaimed director in the DC(EU-films) as the DC(EU-films)'s ""Feige""? Are some of you that desperate? I could understand if so-- I mean look what we've all been put through but come on.   This is the very definition of pulling shit out of your ass.",1
Yeah but a sequel will se diminishing returns,0
"But did they try it? Did they really? Instead of letting the interconnected DCEU grow naturally, they forced it and then got spooked that they made the wrong choice in forcing/rushing it and are now throwing any idea at the wall to see what sticks.",1
"I fully agree, but would also say from a neutral stance that the actual current team of execs and filmmakers haven't tried it. Not that they should, just saying.",1
Sit down.,1
Just need that on a big ol' canvas. I wonder if it would all look cool in B+W. Or if just the middle section B+W?. Hmmmm.,2
This makes me so sad the Deathstroke movie isn't happening.,3
"I don‚Äôt want to fight you, Slade.",2
Joe also supports the [Snyder Cut](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5B4fj6hrtL/?igshid=14d269xtbxj0b) too.,1
Man he looked so cool here...  Dead- Who??? LOL  A crossover DeadPool vs Deathstroke would be EPIC!!!,1
"That would be an interesting look. I have a poster of Arkham Origins Deathstroke on my wall. It's printed over some kind of thick foam (in my country we call it ""k-line""). If you use the same material, it would look amazing!",1
"Yet... Maybe in the future, we'll get something. I heard Tony Daniel, who wrote Deathstroke New 52 comics is writing a movie screenplay/script",2
I wouldn't want to fight me neither.,2
Plus Joe said a while back it's still in the works (And he is good friends with James Gunn......),1
A practical joker means he's a trickster. They weren't talking about the Joker from the DC universe.,3
He wasn't very practical at all.,1
"Obviously, still very cool ü§ù",0
I loved him in Fringe,2
I wish I were Levar Burton,2
"Yeah, I can see it. Nice to see some New Gods content on this subreddit",2
Hell yeah! He's good Police.,1
I'm down   Curious to see your takes for the other characters like Darkseid,1
Toys R Me!!!!   Reddick is a great choice. Fun fact: He was in Jonah Hex.,1
The great question is who would pay Darkseid! My pick is Denzel Washington!! I think it‚Äôs top notch casting and a name worth of DARKSEID.  Btw this guy is a great casting choice for Metron!,0
As a halo fan. I want Keith David as Darkseid. He voiced the Arbiter(Alien in gold armor in this video)    https://youtu.be/1G2uz26smY0,2
>My pick is Denzel Washington!!  Heard he's also being wanted for Magneto.,1
Kevin Griveaux for Darkseid,1
I might do a fancast soon.,1
"Also Mongul in either JL or YJ, if I remember correctly.",1
Nicee,1
Is this true or not? Because now some news sites are reporting that the sequel rumours are false.,1
"Nope this is WB we're talking about, proven to be one of the most reactionary studios making movies at the moment",2
I can. Have some integrity WB.   Other Orgin stories would be great though. I would love to see a LUTHOR movie  EDIT: There. My point still stands.,2
I can‚Äôt deny I‚Äôm curious to see what the Joaquin-verse‚Äôs grown up Bruce Wayne / Batman is like.,1
Wrong tag tho,1
It's THR so it HAS to be true >.>,1
I honestly believe Joaquin would say no. Sequels are not his style,0
DC Comics isn‚Äôt the one making these decisions. If this headline is to be believed then this is all Warner Bros. and Todd Phillips. They‚Äôre the ones making the decisions on what to do with these characters.,1
"I feel like it‚Äôs more Humor than News, so that‚Äôs what I went with.",1
"Well, if the story/script is good, I don't see any reason for him to not return.",1
"That‚Äôs what I was thinking, as well.",0
Integrity < Money,1
I can‚Äôt blame them for wanting to capitalize on the success of the movie. This is a movie studio after all and this is their long term goal. On the other hand a filmmaker can wait until they have the right story to tell before rushing into a sequel. Which is what I‚Äôm hoping is happening.,2
We were stripped from seeing Darkseid and some sweet Omega Beam action.  That sucks so much,3
Notice how he put in the date Jan 2017.  Zack stepped down in May,3
She comes face to face with Uxas when she enters the Shrine of the Amazons in Greece investigating the ancient warning fire.  She then goes to Wayne Hangar to inform Bruce which leads into voice over history lesson. This is the start of the second act,3
"1) This is awesome!  2) Zack is being cheeky. This is Diana‚Äôs (Gal‚Äôs) first time seeing Darkseid most likely, pretty sure she‚Äôs recording the audio for her voiceover description of the history lesson scene.",3
I pity the fools who thought this cut didn't exist. Just look at all of the stuff that's been coming out in the last 6 months.,3
I just saw someone the other day making the argument: you think SC exists? you think it has ADR? It's unwatchable. RIP to that person's goal posts.,3
"""PROPERTY OF WARNER BROS""  Yeah there's no way Warner would let him leak this without repercussions unless it was approved.  Something is happening.",3
"Just the other day Screen Junkies Universe was going on about how they didn't finish ADR so it would have terrible sound, like everything recorded in a hallway or with wind going by. I can't help but feel like this is a direct response to those detractors.",3
"Makes sense as Ray Porter did ADR twice, once in Jan 2017, and his last in mid-March 2017 ;)",3
Holy tits!!!!!,3
Jesus Christ WB...,3
"Okay. I used to say that I didn‚Äôt give a f*ck about the Snyder Cut.  I was wrong.   I now *really* want to see the Snyder Cut. So much potential and world-building cut away. C‚Äômon, WB.",2
I NEED TO SEE THIS.   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,3
And only at the 2:10 mark,3
"Well just when I think its impossible to be any more hyped for the SnyderCut, Zack drops another bomb and my hype level increases ten fold!",3
Oh man that is fucking cool.,3
O___O,2
Oh that‚Äôs nice-  WONDER WOMAN FACE TO FACE WITH *DARKSEID?*,3
"Can you imagine being the stars of this movie, seeing this epic shit, and then fast forward to the end of the year and seeing the final product in the film. I'd have been so humiliated and embarrassed. Especially for Cavill.",2
Ladies and Gents enjoy the ride we are making history and as a fandom I couldn‚Äôt be happier. It‚Äôs only a matter of time. We do this for Zack we do this for Autumn we do this for Artistic freedom we do this for suicide prevention we do it for Justice and to all the doubters the ones who kept trying to sweep it under the rug saying it didn‚Äôt exist. I say this Fuck You All!!  Seriously no harm in the vulgarity just a nice way to say don‚Äôt ever doubt the dream !!,3
So does he mean she actually talks to him or in the history lesson maybe?,2
Zack posted this same pic on Vero except it was ADR with Bruce in the hangar,2
RELEASE THE DAMN SNYDER CUT ALREADY!!!,3
"What i like about the SnyderCut is that everyone in this sub was like ""That is dumb, snyder is dumb this is a waste of time, move on"" and such  Now freaking everybody is on board the train. Affleck, Gadot, Momoa, Fisher and the list goes on.  Why did you all have to be so negative?? This sub couple of months ago was legit toxic towards anyone in support of Snyder's vision",2
"It's possible this is looking through the boomtube at the end with the justice league looking at him. Maybe Diana ends up saying something to him?   Fan theory dialogue time. Supes ""who is that?"" Diana ""Uxas"" Uxas ""No, Darkseid"".  Does that work?",2
Crap.,1
# #ReleaseTheSnyderCut,1
DIANA CAME FACE TO FACE WITH DARKSEID?!?,3
https://i.imgur.com/bQkerXL.jpg,2
"Here is just the Uxas image of the monitor, with corrected proportions https://imgur.com/a/KSYnAed",1
What platform did he post it?,1
"Half way through the movie (if it is 214 mins). This must be in the history lesson then, or maybe something else? Zack says ""face to face"" it might not be the history lesson...",2
"Wait, why would Diana ever see Uxas? Wouldn‚Äôt he be Darkseid by that point?",2
Remember Vero?,1
"What is the name of the platform, Zack Snyder posting these photos? Appreciate if anyone answers",1
Where does he share these photos?,1
"Even though it's in the Snyder Cut, I still don't like the idea of Diana telling Bruce everything about the enemy, like it's just a convenient way to make the characters and audience aware of the plot.  I assume that's one of the changes the studio made while Zack was still on board.  They forced mandates and ""fixes"" on the movie that Zack was still scheduled to shoot, and to doctored Terrio's original script too.  An absolute shame!",1
Finished vfx my ass,1
I love at the 2 hour 10 min mark we were supposed to get a scene with darkseid.,1
This can‚Äôt all be in Zack‚Äôs JL can it? I mean I‚Äôll take everything I can regarding the Snyder Cut but it feels like this movie perhaps has TOO much going on.,0
Release it or move on. This is ridiculous.,0
rElEAsE ThE SynDeR cUT!!!!!!!,0
"Serious question. As a Superman fan and apologist and Snyder fan. I loved 300, I loved Dawn of the Dead remake, I loved Watchmen, I loved Man of Steel. I thought BvS was okay at best. I hated Justice League. Do we really think this cut is going to be any good?",0
I wish he'd stop saying Uxas.,0
"why is darkseid in this movie smh, its overstuffed already",0
"The fact that he put this up after Sunday's HUMONGOUS demand for the Snyder Cut makes me believe it isn't coming out now. Check my posts, I supported the fuck out of the trend like crazy, so I'm not trying to be a hater or pessimistic. If the cut is on its way, then stop showing more content from the movie, because now it's just a tease as to what could have been. I'd expect WB and Zack to be in the early stages of negotations with him, so if he's still doing this, then that'd be fucking stupid on his part to be spoiling shit before the movie was to come out.",0
I'm gonna cop it for this but I think I'm okay we didn't get much Darkseid  I feel like he should show up at the end bu the additional teases feel they'd be out of place almost (Would much rather see this dude fleshed out in New Gods or something),1
Also notice how the CGI is in the very early stages...,3
Oddly specific but does make sense and sounds better,3
That sounds awesome.,3
Given this picture and timestamp I'd say she's already in the hangar and goes into the history lesson from there.  https://twitter.com/Squall_70/status/1196903805465645056?s=19,3
This was history lesson first. The same one shown in pieces in London to the press I think.,2
Uxas is the name of young Darkseid. We deserve to see Ray Porter's majestic and glorious voice in the role!,3
I mean after what happened on Sunday I wouldn't want to be the guy who interviewed Jesse Eisenberg about the Snyder Cut.,3
"I swear I don‚Äôt get these people. Despite so many of the actors and crew members saying otherwise, you still knuckleheads say ‚Äúoh the cut doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù. If it didn‚Äôt exist, why would these people lie about it? I get Momoa owes a lot to Zack, but he doesn‚Äôt strike me as the type of person to do this just solely to please someone‚Äôs ego.",3
"I mean, do we know if this pre-rendered scene in the screen shot is finished?",2
"Where does it say that?! I feel pretty blind, lol.",3
"I suppose there could be a loophole about it being his photo that just happens to have the image, or he could be just plain bending the rules a little.  That said, I think at the very least the powers that be are having a serious discussion about it.",3
"That's just a low quality ""preview"" of a film that you work with most of the time during production (do rough cut and audio and other work that doesn't require full quality  - raw - clips that have resolution up to 8k and are generally bitch to work with). They tipically have watermarks and timecode. People who use raw clips are post-production and cgi folks. As the movie nears completion, previews get relinked for complete footage (cgi and colors done). You almost never work with raw during editing.  EDIT: Source: me editing TV / Film",3
"He's not an employee of WB anymore and also he's did do a aquaman video leak on his twitter (finalized CGI which never made either aq or jl movie). but yeah, hard to tell wtf is going on.",2
Screen Junkies is like Collider: full of crap,3
The screen junkies guy? From youtube?,3
Link to that info?,2
"I am told film counters start at 01:00:00, so 1hr 10 minutes.",3
"Half way through the movie (if it is 214 mins). This must be in the history lesson then, or maybe something else? Zack says ""face to face"" it might not be the history lesson...  edit: nvm the time stamp is 1 hr ahead so it is earlier on in the film.",3
Pretty sure Snyder is just being cheeky about the photo. This looks like her voicing over the original History Lesson.,3
"Lol, I feel it too, kind of crazy to see it unfold and redeem the art, raise awareness for suicide and just redeem Zack who has been through something that quite frankly no one should ever have to handle. I hope it's soon.",2
Pictures of him on the walls of the shrine of the amazons.  Ten voice over through the history lesson as she tells the story to Bruce.  Actual face to face at the climax through a boom tube,2
She is telling the story,3
"It's the History Lesson scene, likely with Diana's voiceover. It was meant to be with Uxas invading Earth for the Anti-Life Equation and the reshoots repurposed it with Steppenwolf. Look to the Apokalipsian ships behind him https://imgur.com/a/KSYnAed",1
No. I actually heard of it cuz of Zack,2
His Vero account,1
"What would be a better way of doing it, though? There aren‚Äôt going to be books on the subject he can read since it happened a really long time ago. The alternative is to have a villain explain it, but then it would be a cheesy monologue. Maybe a dream sequence, but that was already done in BvS with the alternate future timeline.  I guess you could have a sequence at the beginning just for viewers, but it‚Äôs Batman, he‚Äôs going to want as much information from Diana as possible anyways.",2
"I mean, it's about as much plot as Return of the King had. And that movie was friggin' awesome.",3
"Zack left in May, this took place in January so it's definitely from Zack's cut.",3
"A movie can‚Äôt have ‚Äútoo much‚Äù going on, there‚Äôs no rule for that.  If the storyteller feels that they were able to include all of the elements that they wanted and communicate them in the manner they intended then the film is at least a creative success on that level. The rest is up to how much an audience is willing to invest of themselves in interpreting the communication.",3
"this is the history lesson most likely?    But at 3.5 hours of film, it wouldn't be the same as someone smashing a bunch of plot points together",3
"It's most likely the History Lesson, so nothing new here.",2
Sure it can. *BvS* had  a lot going on too.,1
"So you loved the majority of his films and thought another was average, and you think it *won't* be better than the trainwreck theatrical cut?",3
"The justice league you hate is a Frankenstein. No one knows if the true snyder movie will be good or not, we are just asking for it.",3
"which edition of bvs did you dislike? no malice towards your answer I'm just curious, and I have hope that its good because I love his earlier films (especially bus ultimate edition), but I really want it released just to support the director",2
"I think asking ‚Äúis it good‚Äù is sort of a fruitless question.  Snyder fans want to see and think a Snyder movie will be good. Not that it‚Äôs a rule, but why wouldn‚Äôt that be the case. If you like Clark being a loner in MoS, then why wouldn‚Äôt you like extended backstories of Barry, Arthur, and Victor being loners. If you liked his tendency for long movies, painterly images, and serious tone, what would even be a Snyder fan‚Äôs argument against it.   If you think Snyder is utterly untalented, then you‚Äôve probably made up your mind.  And if one is truly a neutral observer, then I think one owes it to themselves to say the SC would not be artificially under 2 hours. It would not have weird insert shots interrupting scenes. And you just can‚Äôt have a polar opposite director remake the film in post.  There‚Äôs a scene in trailer where Batman is standing on a grim reaper gargoyle with thunder in the background. In the theatrical cut, that same image is blocked by a plastic tarp. Which version do you think is better?",2
"Short answer :Yes. Long answer:Those who fight for this cut, do it because they liked Snyder's previous film, so it's safe to say they would enjoy his Cut. Also, every movie he made that has a director's cut, people say it's the superior version.",3
If you click on my profile I‚Äôve written the full plot summary for the Snyder cut for everything that is known.,2
Mos Superman returns so you get that to look forward to. Mos style crazy battle scenes in the ancient war and supes and stepps going at it massively like zod v supes...and off course a better score and higher stakes/darker tone  Much better then the TC even if it has pacing/story issues and a lot of exposition,2
Zack Snyder directed action sequences of Justice League would've been worth it alone.,2
"At the very least it looks like we get another action piece at star labs, one in Diana telling history and a better fight sequence at the end against steppenwolf. We get characters more consistent with the tone/set up of the previous films. We get a longer run time that hopefully fleshes Barry and Victor's characters a little more and should in theory help with pacing. We also get the first look at Uxas/Darkseid on the big screen. Now whether you ultimately end up agreeing with his characterizations and like the plot and whatnot are up to you, I think on paper at least it makes for a better movie overall",2
"Yes. Better than what we got. Also, for those of us who are fans of MoS and BvS, we will likely really enjoy what Snyder puts up on screen. He had already said BvS was the DCEU‚Äôs Empire Strikes Back, and would be the darkest, most complex film of the bunch. JL was a lot more straightforward, simple, and fun.",2
"The way I see it, even if the Snyder Cut is bad, it's better to have it, and know, then to never have it at all wishing for what could have been.  The people who will like probably will.  People who won't, well they won't.  The people who viciously hate Zack Snyder will despise it because it's not a Marvel movie and because they want to be right.  I stand as someone who is optimistic it will be good.",1
It would literally be impossible for it to be worse than the shit Whedon slapped together,2
"Yeah, and I guess Return of the King was overstuffed too. Oh wait that movie is heavily acclaimed and nobody says that.",2
Damn dawg. I wonder how you handle every other movie in existence that introduces a handful of characters.,2
"That's not more new content. he's been showing us the same scenes over and over. Funeral, history lesson, and star labs. he's not spoiling us for a reason. It's coming just be patient.",2
"Correct, it hurts me to say it but if there is no confirmation of release this week it's not happening.   Next step is it leaks in its current state even without final polish...",0
"Whether he was going to be here or ""part2""  or any future DC films that were tied in. I meant it like that. They teased him for nothing",1
Also notice how the coffee cup from GOT made it onto this table somehow.,3
Look at the photo Zack shared on Father's day fool. The same scene was fully rendered by the time he left the project in may 2017. 5 months of full time vfx work is heaps,3
"This doesn't have to be a proof of any timeline the VFX were at.    She is voicing over the History scene in JL.  That Uxas image is pre-viz.    The point is that this stuff is only done when the edit is locked.  And as far as pre-viz, he would continue to use it in place of the files being worked on until those scenes are finished, and he replaces them.  So until theyre at 100% they would basically be doing things with previz in the edit.",1
It still is lol,3
omg too close shot ow previous one.  02 : 09 : 40 : 16  &   02 : 10 : 49 :10,2
I‚Äôm aware  edit: and I agree!,3
"Not to mention, praising the SC could hurt Momoa's relationship with WB. He risks his career for the artistic vision he prefers.",3
"Even if you play it in front of them, they will still deny it.",3
"Its modern internet culture. Everyone has to pick a side.  After x number of battles and flame wars on a topic, the actual content of the topic debated doesn‚Äôt even matter anymore; it‚Äôs solely about rooting for one‚Äôs chosen tribe and never backing down.",3
"Are people actually still arguing it doesn't exist? Seems like it's pretty obvious some sort of cut exists.   But to this day I dont understand why Whedon, who clearly knows and appreciates DC and its characters, chose to take out so much of Darkseid.",3
"The new narrative is ""it doesn't exist\* - move on!"".  \*""It doesn't exist because technically he had some other stuff that he never got to shoot because there were rewrites before principal photography even started"".  I've seen few people being total dicks about this on Twitter because they think that somehow ""proving they're right"" by saying that it doesn't exist on a technicality by redefining what we mean by ""Snyder Director Cut"", they are therefore winning.  It's bizarre. Give it up. It exists. If you hate Snyder and anyone, fan or not, who wants to see his stuff, then just grow up and go do something more productive than railing on people who just want to see something they might enjoy.",3
"They at least worked throughout March. He announces stepping down May 22. He was working on Aquaman effects on March 1. The tragedy is listed as March 12 and Zack said he tried going back to work for sometime after. Paired with Jay Oliva saying that they worked on VFX throughout production, among other comments and pictures, I'd wager that upwards of 80% of vfx are done. I made up that number, but it's got to be better than not. Zack saying that he didn't get Swanwick turning into Martian Manhunter leads me to believe it is small things that are unfinished, rather than big things like the history lesson.",3
"Big watermark across Darkseid's crotch  EDIT (it's not even a joke, just look)",3
It's written very faintly on the screen,2
Years ago they were able to voice interesting takese on topics. Now it's just a bunch of manchilds at a table trying to make the wisest cracks.  Their video's are such a waste of time.  Fuck Andy Signore but the channel went to Total shit after he had to leave.,2
Not Hal Rudnick. Screen Junkies is now a part of Fandom Entertainment and on that channel they have a show called Screen Junkies Universe or SJU where they discuss trending entertainment news. I just checked and it looks like the guy who made the ADR comments on that show is named Billy Business.,3
Private source.  Believe in it if you will though.,3
Nice info. Thanks!,3
Well. People are saying his saying Uxas is telling. As he is Darkseid in the present.,2
"> 214 mins  Good lord, and I thought Watchmen (movie) was long. I think we are in for a treat if this is true.",2
I believe the history lesson was supposed to open the film originally. They repurposed part of it for josstice league.,2
"Oh yeah, right it makes sense haha.  That ship in the shot sure looks like the one Stepp is in front of in the TC, also the same scene he got copy pasted over Darkseid.",3
Thanks. Wow I didn‚Äôt even know this app existed.,1
"I thought the ""history lesson"" was supposed to be a prologue anyway at the beginning of the movie-like LOTR.  I guess what I'm wondering is how would this sequence have been done if Zack was able to continue his and Terrio's plan since BvS?  Like if WB didn't step in at all following BvS, how would the Justice League ""Part One"" be different?    Because ultimately THAT's the story I want to hear.",1
"Especially in a 3.5 hr movie. Like Return of the King had a lot going on, and it still missed some fan favorite portions of the book (Like the Shire War).  Honestly I'd have been willing to give up my ""One book gets one movie, no stretching"" rule just to get that part.",2
"Maybe not in terms of scenes we know about, but to see that it really was Uxas in the original VFX for this history sequence was new. Or maybe just to me--I had assumed they replaced him with Steppenwolf much earlier in production.",2
"I liked bvs okay. Theatrical cut. I bought the other cut and it didn't seem all that different.  I'm not anti ZS cut.  just making conversation. I dislike JL so much that it just seemed unlikely to me that I could possibly like that movie as is not really the pacing or editing that bothers me as much as it is the entire movie just seems bad aside from the acting. I don't like story and the effects seemed super cartoony compared to the previous movies. However, I would appreciate to be proven wrong.  Edit: forgive my grammar and missing words please",2
"Not even just that. There are people who disliked his movies but thought JL was even worse because it was such a Frankensteined mess. The logic I occasionally see from them is ""Shit movie with consistent tone > shit movie without one"".  I mean, whatever gets it released.",2
Hey I would like to make a comic on JL trilogy Snyder planned you are a good story teller and I know the art....if you feel interested just pm me on Reddit we can discuss about it and if you want to check my artwork click on my profile,1
"If they exist, I'm down.",2
Snyder is no Peter Jackson so that argument is invalid.,1
"Yup, that seems about right. Fuck WB. I hate them I hate them I hate them. They're sitting back in their chairs in their conference room just laughing it up right about now.   ""AHAHAHAHA ReLeAsE tHe SnYdEr CuT. We're still not going to give it to them! Zack tried but god damn that shit was so bad I thought I was going to grow a tumor watching it! AHaHahHaha!""  Fuck them.",0
Oh I see now  Granted we'll be seeing him in New Gods so that's fun,1
Emilia Clarke in the DCEU confirmed.,3
The same company weta VFX did graphic design for GOT too,2
It's amazing people still believe this when you could use Google for 10 seconds and find out that it's not true.,3
"It seems, in Zack's version, this is the history lesson portion where the tribes of man and the Amazonians face Uxas the first time, and then at the end when she beheads Steppenwolf, they see a first glimpse of Darkseid through the boomtube.",3
Some guy was being snobby and just railing on Snyder Cut fans and cracking jokes about people getting worked up over something that doesn't even exist.   Which is kind of funny because Jesse--who seems pretty neutral or just straight-up removed from the matter--said he believes it exists because they shot and reshot content he's pretty sure didn't make it into the movie.,3
"This guy interviewed Jesse saying ""oh these crazy fans and their crazy conspiracies"".",3
This blogger tried to bait Jesse into hating on Zack and Jesse played coy at first and then flipped the script on him.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/DC\_Cinematic/comments/dp52z2/jl\_jesse\_eisenberg\_doesnt\_play\_along\_when\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/dp52z2/jl_jesse_eisenberg_doesnt_play_along_when_an/),3
"Gadot‚Äôs too. Lying will kill their careers and their public image to the fanbase,",3
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how adding an extra hour of runtime will somehow change the film‚Äôs narrative‚Äù - knuckleheads,3
"Because he had to make a two-hour movie, not a minute longer. And JL had less solo movie prequels than The Avengers did. JL needed more buildup and character work. There wasn‚Äôt room for a lot of Darkseid in only two hours. He only teased Thanos in The Avengers, but there was already the beginnings of a plan to deliver on that promise. Whedon probably didn‚Äôt want to hurt fans with what he knew would‚Äôve been an empty promise. He could probably tell that he was making a movie that wasn‚Äôt gonna be anywhere near as good as The Avengers. I want the Snyder cut, but the released version is not the Whedon cut. It‚Äôs the WB cut",2
"Because WB told him to keep the film under 2 hours. Whedon at that point knew he was just a director for hire, so he didn't really care. He got the actors to phone in some reshoots, stamped approval to some new FX, and wrote some of his B material for new scenes. Whedon wasn't really given control, he basically just gave WB what they wanted for a paycheck. Age of Ultron and the restrictions Feige gave him there kinda broke the guy, so when he realized WB was doing the same, he didn't even try.",2
They either say it doesn‚Äôt exist or it‚Äôs not finished. Folks would rather believe sites like Collider who have decided to hop on the Snyder Cut bandwagon now.,2
"Hell, it‚Äôs the same on certain sites as well. I know a guy who convinced himself that Snyder‚Äôs doing this just to satisfy his ego. Seriously, the guy freaking lost his daughter and watch his work go to waste. Any artist would be pissed if they were in his shoes.",2
So Darkseids crotch belongs to WB,3
"Lol oh yeah, I see it now! Thanks. And you weren't joking!",3
"Ohhhh, I see it now! Thanks. Was looking in the corners and right at the top / bottom!",2
Ohhhh gotcha. Thanks for the exp,2
"""I BELIEVE""",3
"Welp, I have no reason to not believe you :)",3
"I've heard the Snyder cut starts from Lois's pov mourning Superman's death, since BvS started with Bruce's pov. I'm looking forward to the opening sequence so much, because Zack always does an epic job with that.",3
Nah i hear it opens like BvS. A perspective from the end of the film before it.,3
Uxas led the invasion in search of the Anti life Equation. Steppenwolf supported him. Uxas blamed the failed invasion on Steppenwolf and didn‚Äôt let him return to Apokolips until he completed his mission to secure the Anti Life Equation for Darkseid,2
"hey don't worry about grammar and nothing wrong with disliking BVS, movies are subjective at the end of the day and are made to entertain, I think what Zack shot/intended for JL is very different than the Frankenstein cut we got too. Have a good one!",2
Not sure how to PM can you PM me first?,1
You're right. Nothing Snyder made is as bad as Battle of Five Armies.  Okay maybe Sucker Punch. I love Snyder and even I admit that movie was bad.,0
Not listening to fans is disgusting. Next step is #boycottbop to send a message were done,0
The New Gods movies is being made by the person who made Wrinkle in Time...,1
Oh how I wish this happens,3
I thought it was Conleth Hill who did it.,1
Lord of the rings too.,2
I concur,3
Jesse also went on to say he thinks it would be cool to release the Snyder Cut of the film.,3
"Yeah, that blogger was a real cunt. His heart seemed to drop into his stomach when Eisenberg‚Äôs response to the idea of the SC was a very innocent and optimistic sounding ‚ÄúBut that would be cool though right [seeing it released for the fans]?‚Äù  He wasn‚Äôt even trying to fuck with the interviewer. Eisenberg sounded like he literally first heard of the SC at that very moment and was giving an honest, spontaneous take on the topic.",3
What a tool. I don‚Äôt trust anyone who refers to themselves as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù,3
That was really well handled by Jesse. The blogger was being a tool.,2
"Indeed. Plus, the anti-Semites would use that as an excuse to throw more hate at Gal.",3
"I'm curious if Danny Elfman was actually forced on Joss for both movies now that you've said it like that (Especially because the Elfman Justice League theme and his ""New"" version of the Avengers Theme that was never used again sound very similar).  Not to disrespect Elfman, but I'll take Silvestri and Junkie over him any day.  But in Justice Leagues case they were probably trying to pull that John Williams shit where they recycle that music people like. ""People like Elfman's Batman theme, and Williams Superman March, so put them in.""  Superman Returns also did that and it took attention away from John Ottmans score.",2
They've got everyone by the balls.,3
"I watch the show a good amount and while it was out of character they are all normally really positive and nice, I watched the ep too and billy seemed to not know much about the situation for the most part",3
Yeah. Except I still wish MoS had an opening credits sequence like BvS did.,1
Oh wow I could dig that too.,3
I love that type of symmetry in film.,2
Click on username and start chat....anyway I sent reply check that out,1
Lol. Snyder will never come near the level of brilliance of Mr Jackson.,1
"I'm already doing that.   ""Go SeE jOkEr BrO, IT's So GoOd""  I'm not seeing that shit. I'm not giving WB another cent. I want the Snyder Cut. The only money i'll pay after that if they ever released it is a proper Man of Steel sequel and everything that lives in the spirit of Zack moving forward. Period.",0
"I'm already doing that.   ""Go SeE jOkEr BrO, IT's So GoOd""  I'm not seeing that shit. I'm not giving WB another cent. I want the Snyder Cut. The only money i'll pay after that if they ever released it is a proper Man of Steel sequel and everything that lives in the spirit of Zack moving forward. Period.   I'll promote NOT to support WB until we get the movie. I'll make sure no one supports them. I think we need to do that once HBO Max rolls around. If within the next 4 months that the movie hasn't been announced, we need to take the movement forward and start demonizing the company to the max and fuck up their box office plans. Steer everyone away from WB and let them become poor.",0
Who is also a huge New Gods fan and is being assisted by the man who wrote Mr. Miracle‚Äôs recent run (considered by some to be one of the greatest comics of 2018),1
"She also did Selma and When They See Us, both of which were brilliant.",1
I always used to think she‚Äôd be a great adult Barbara/Batgirl or some similar role. Definitely a hero,3
Emilia for Hawkgirl or Mera (She's even been Jason's love interest and they seem like good friends),2
 Why didn't i concur.,1
"Elfman was good until he started just recycling his music. His last great score was Spidey 2 honestly. Yeah, it was all done to nostalgia whore after reactions to BvS.  Abd the comparison to Returns becomes all the more clear.",1
"Dan is level headed. Most of the others, as Joe admitted, will take shots at Snyder at nearly every turn.",3
"I dunno, starting at Superman's birth and just Krypton in general was really awesome.",3
lmaooo im sure it was your 14 dollar movie ticket that stopped joker from making 1 billion with an R rating......... Oh WAIT!,0
To be fair joker is one of the best cmbs I've ever seen lol. I only watched that because of Phoenix and it being r rated. It's probably the only good thing to come out of ss flopping fan/critically  Everything else wb does can get fkd until they respect Zack's hard work and release his cut which the fans are begging for  In 2 weeks if they don't announce it I'm starting the boycott campaign,1
lol do you need help? are you going to be ok?,0
"If they ever replace Amber Heard for the shit she‚Äôs pulled, Ive always thought Emilia Clarke would be a great Mera",3
"I'm always surprised when people pick Emilia for all these roles. I'm probably gonna get a lot of heat for this...she's too chubby. She played Sarah Conner, you know the absolutely ripped soldier and looked like the only war she had fought was for the last pie.",0
I have always wanted Emilia to be Hawkgirl. Just something about her that makes me think she's the perfect woman to have wings.  Probably because she's an angel.,1
"Weird decision too. I feel like of all the issues BvS has, its score was the last thing wrong with it. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL did brilliant work on it.",1
"Reminds of a video of a radio station interviewing Snyder, but during the interview they would mute him and/or play sound from a porn video over him.",2
"Yeah, it's just I miss opening credits sequences. Especially because that's a Superman tradition. It could've been a modern update on the old school credits. New font, new score (""Flight""), but similar old style. Paying homage while also updating for the modern age, essentially what MoS as a movie did to the Donner duology.",1
"Lol, I don't give a fuck. I'm glad it made 1 billion. JL before it was sabotaged by WB was already going to make 1.1 billion. For future movies, if we don't get the Snyder Cut, I'm boycotting the fuck out of them.",1
"I know it's a good movie, but I'm not supporting them in any way because they STILL haven't delivered justice to everyone involved in JL, Zack and the fans.   Good, if you actually go through with that, let me know. I'll boycott the fuck out of them.",0
"I don‚Äôt know enough about the Amber Heard thing to comment, but yeah, Emilia would be great at that too",3
What did amber heard do?,2
What shit did she pull?,1
"she, like everyone else, has the ability to work out.",2
You're not wrong,1
Honestly I think the issue with the score was time mostly.  I think if there was more time and collaboration with maybe Junkie or Hans we could have gotten an amazing soundtrack,1
Good and take more snyder fans with you,1
Plus her and Jason seem to be friends in real life so they‚Äôd have awesome chemistry on screen in those kind of roles. They had good chemistry in GoT too but Jason‚Äôs character was obviously very different.,3
"Nobody knows enough about the amber heard thing, man. Just fans of either sides spreading rumors and shit.  Right now I'm only concerned with what they're actually doing, and Amber is doing a lot of good charity work and I appreciate it.   That's all I care about.",1

"That's my point, she had the chance to play Sarah Conner, probably the most leanest and ripped female iconic hero we have ever had and she played it dumpy. If there was any role where she needed to get that stuff sorted it was that one and she didn't.",0
"You realize that this guy is one of only a very few Snyder fans who want to boycott modern DC movies, right?  Most of us are very happy with the newer movies feeling very consistent with their director's visions. Joker is Phillip's movie. Aquaman in Wan's movie. Justice League is NOT Snyder's movie. That's how most of us feel.",1
Hard to believe it‚Äôs the same guy sometimes haha,2
Thanks for posting. I haven‚Äôt heard about this at all,1
I'm sure she'd do it if they paid her enough money to. After all Chris Pratt did when he was cast in Guardians of the Galaxy.,1
I agree with you but Chris Pratt isn‚Äôt the best example because he intentionally [gained weight](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/chris-pratt-only-got-well-written-roles-after-gaining-weight-a7467006.html)  to get more comedic roles. So he just got back into shape for a role like that.,1
Just goes to show how much the quality of a film matters. A little contraversey helps too.,3
It's crazy how many places this movie is killing. It's not doing over 100m in any of these places but it's  ww earnings is still double the us total.,3
This thing didn‚Äôt even have China. What the fuck.,2
I think it made around 8.75 + milllion dollars from India.  The word of mouth was really strong here.  Alot of fans who were blown away by Heath Ledger's performance as Joker went into theatre and came out with amazement.  Alot of theatres were added on the 2nd weekend after the reviews started pouring in.,2
Fantastic!!!,1
6.5 million dollars from Saudi Arabia!! We only have theaters in 3 cities as of now!!,1
See. Businesses don't need China to make money. Especially when their government has influence on what content is gets shown.,1
6.3m dollars in Turkey (36m TL). Almost 2 millions viewer,1
"Well, it didn‚Äôt have China either.",1
Because most of these places have a fraction of the population of the US.,2
+No China.,1
also it didn't have a lot of screens in India,0
I think he can probably have anything he wants now.,3
"I feel like the new motto at DC/WB is that whatever the creatives want to use they can use and continuity doesn't matter. The DC Universe is the DC Universe. You want to use this character in your thing and have that actor in the role? Okay.  Look at all the Superman stuff we're starting to get, shows like Titans name dropping everybody, Deathstroke being in several continuities, etc.",3
I‚Äôd like to see Rooney Mara as Harley for Joaquin‚Äôs Joker.,3
I think it wouldn't be a problem since they're happily making a Batman movie with no connection to the current main DC movie canon.   And the general audience mostly already understands *Joker* is it's own separate world.  Edit: I think the more interesting question is whether Reeves would be allowed to use the Joker since two exist already. Is there a maximum Joker level?,2
I really hope this sequel never gets made!,2
Its possible but i doubt it since how popular Margot is,2
That‚Äôs the only thing that would make me interested in a joker sequel.   Suicide squad slightly glossed over how Harley fell for joker. We got a glimpse of it but she was already established in that film.   I‚Äôd love to see Harley in a character driven movie as we watch her descent into madness and infatuation as the joker uses her.,1
"I've been thinking what would the reaction be if after 2 Joker movies and 2 Batman movies, the third is a Batman v Joker with Phoenix and Pattinson.",1
"**No**. I don't think so.   I'm pretty sure that Margot Robbie would heavily be against it, and that would be enough for Warner Bros. Unlike Jared Leto with the Joker, it seems Robbie does have creative control and power over Harley Quinn, movie-wise.",1
Zazie Beetz would actually make a good Harley. They would just have to figure out a way to transform Sophie into Harley.,0
"I know this is a crackpot internet theory, but I like to think of Arthur Fleck to be the man who inspires the Joker in the DCEU",0
Sure let Phillips butcher another character he screwed Joker so badly.,0
This. Only if it's Rooney Mara as Harleen Quinzel.,2
"Reeves will be allowed to use the Joker but that more or less kills Leto‚Äôs chances of ever playing the character again, not that his stunts on the set of Suicide Squad and during the shooting of Joker didn‚Äôt already do that for him.",0
why do you say that,0
Which is why they may let it happen? It would also mean Joker is in the main universe.,1
What if I told you another cut of that film existed...,1
"And the movie already established the cult-like devotion that people had for Joker, so there's definitely already a precedent for Harley.",1
I think Jared Leto once said that his Joker was actually Jason Todd after being tortured by the Joker so it could be possible,0
"Yeah, I feel like two might be the maximum at any one time. More looks messy.  I hope he doesn't go to Joker until the third movie, though. I'm actually a bit disappointed he's stuck to the famous baddies for The Batman. It could have been an opportunity to mix in a less known character with a couple of better known ones. I think Suicide Squad has (and BOP will) opened up the audience to be amenable to new characters.",0
That is the single dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard.,2
what do you mean,0
Jason Todd would never become the Joker. It goes against every part of his character. I don‚Äôt care how much he‚Äôs tortured.,2
are you familiar with the Arkham Knight video game,0
He never becomes Joker. Also Jared never said something like that. You read the rumours which were lies. They already said there wasn't a case like that.,1
These fuckers really thought that they could just sweep this under the rug and everyone would just eat up their Frankenstein JL.,3
"***We‚Äôre not introducing any new characters.***   Mr. Snyder: ""What Russian family?""",3
"> But now with all the pushing he's been doing to get his cut released and the gracious fans who have also used it as a venue to support and donate to Suicide Prevention, **Zack is also doing it for his daughter. The last movie that never got finished was the last project he worked on before his daughter died. And that's very personal and beyond the call for having a director get his creative vision out there.**  No offense, but this is very off base, and honestly is disrespectful to Snyder. You are not in a position to claim that he is doing something for/in honor of his deceased daughter. Unless it personally came out of his mouth, then it's a messed up thing to claim that on his behalf.  You are clearly a fan of his, and as such hopefully you can see why you making this claim is disrespectful.",3
>Zack is also doing it for his daughter.  He never said that. It's gross to even suggest that is why he and others want to see this movie completed.,3
It‚Äôs crazy how that entire first quote is a complete lie. Everything made up and manipulated to make WB look like the good guy. WB didn‚Äôt give a shit about Zack. They saw his daughter as a way to kick him out and they did just that.,2
Don‚Äôt use that. Not cool imo.,2
"Zack's first DC movie Man of Steel was code-named ""Autumn Frost"" after his daughter, Autumn Snyder. She was also filmed in the Justice League movie briefly wearing a GSU football jacket.  Zack posted on Vero ""Humbled by the outpouring and support #afsp"" on Sunday.  ASFP is the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.  There are fans that have personally told Zack Snyder about coping with depression and suicidalism through his films (including myself). He knows. He has not said it explicitly, but he may want to finish the trilogy for his daughter as well. Zack even said his first instinct was to bury himself with work. However, we don't know for sure, and should let him say it himself if he wants.  Zack Snyder fans have raised over $100,000 for mental health and suicide awareness related charities. It is certainly an issue that is part of the movement.  We should instead go after WB's shameful press release that blatantly lied about their intentions and plans.",2

Respectful writeup. It's shameful how WB exploited his family tragedy.   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,2
Someone should ask Geoff Johns about his involvement with the reshoots.,0
"I dream about having some rich executive, in this case Emmerich and once upon a time Tsujihara, sit down in front of a Congressional hearing and read to them their own words: ""*The directing is minimal and it has to adhere to the style and tone and the template that Zack set""* and dare them to explain.",0
Exactly! I see that a lot and it‚Äôs not cool!,2
"Fair. Should have made it more clear that it was speculation, not claiming.    Edited.",0
Exactly! People use that to support their need to see the cut and that‚Äôs not cool at all. I don‚Äôt like that.,3
What about WB's press release that exploited his family tragedy for business reasons?,0
What why??,1
Nothing he said is wrong.,0
"no not this, there were many more scenes that you did not cover. this is still half whedon's.",1
A Congressional hearing...for a movie?,2
They‚Äôre both shitty things to do.,2
Using the daughter to prove a certain point.,2
"Can you elaborate on them so I can add them in please. Which parts of this is ""still half whedon's""?",1
Eh?,1
"Not releasing the Snyder cut is the biggest crime against humanity in recent memory. I hope Toby Emmerich and Kevin Tsujihara suffer and are brought to justice for their crimes, maybe with jail time, for ruining my movie about Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, etc fighting space bugs.  /s",1
I'm talking about a fantasy. And it's in the news. Hook him up a lie detector.  Hang him over a pool of sharks. Use the lasso of truth. Because realistically he'd just walk away if I asked him on the street. At least in my dreams I can show someone their own words and say you're not leaving until I get answers.,1
A press conference may be ?,1
That's what the former DC president said.,2
So they are not friends? Wow what a shocker. I don‚Äôt care lol and nobody does what they do in their personal lives. That‚Äôs my opinion at least.,1
"Context is key. She was praising DC for being director driven with the Joker movie. Someone then brought up Zack Snyder's JL movie, and that's when she said Geoff Johns is no buddy of hers. Geoff Johns played a major role with the JL reshoots, right? If he was, he wouldn't be a buddy of mine either.",2
Lol. Geoff Johns has lived and breathed DC for years bringing us amazing comicbooks that have resurrected characters like Green Lantern and The Flash. He‚Äôs an amazing writer and still works for DC for some reason. I don‚Äôt fcking care if Nelson doesn‚Äôt like him for some reason. Geoff is one of the most important people that have ever worked for DC Comics.,1
"Exactly. He made great comic books. However, live action movies, well, he got demoted.",2
"Fuck Geoff Johns. Just because he's a great comic writer should have him stay in his lane. I bet he's the reason Affleck left and Rick Famuyiwa's topical Flash film was canned. And if he's that good of a writer who lives and breaths DC, why is his writing on Justice League such garbage?",0
Cool. He does better job on comicbooks and tv shows. I love Titans.,0
What's up with his Green Lantern movie script? I just can't believe out of all things were getting a green lantern tv show over a movie version.,1
I don't think he's making GL to be honest. I think that was just a big PR stunt to make him not look like shit when he basically got kicked out of DC Movies,1
"**GUIDEPOST:** THR, *Deadline,* and *Variety* are top-flight outlets. For most stories, these publications largely align. When there is variation in their reporting, as is the case here, we will be allowing multiple posts covering the same story.",1
So basically the Variety article is the middle ground between Hollywood Reporter and Deadline. Lol,3
SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP,2
">Warner Bros. film chief Toby Emmerich has met with writer and director¬†Todd Phillips¬†and co-writer Scott Silver to explore possible ideas for a sequel to the drama about the early days of the Clown Prince of Crime. Insiders caution that the talks are very preliminary, no deal is in place, and no script is currently being written. Phillips is also eager to make sure that any follow-up meets the artistic level of the original, which garnered strong reviews and Oscar buzz for star Joaquin Phoenix. Initially Phillips was pretty clear that he saw ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù as being a one-off.  >Insiders did shoot down reports that Warner Bros. and DC are talking about having Phillips do origin stories for other comic book characters, revealing what went cracked on their trek to the dark side. Any ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù follow-up will take years to pull off and DC has a busy slate.¬†",1
"Hollywood Reporter says a sequel is definitely in the works and Phillips has access to a couple more characters in the future, Deadline says there has been zero discussion and Joker will most likely be a standalone, and Variety says there has been some discussion, but there is nothing in the near future. Welp, this all makes sense lmao",1
Back to not knowing shit. Nothing to see here.,2
"> Any ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù follow-up will take years to pull off and DC has a busy slate.¬†  This is the truth. Their slate right now is full. A ""Joker"" sequel would be like 4 yrs down the road.",1
"Jeff Bridges for High Father, Denzel could be a good Darksied. You could even reverse them and have Denzel as High Father and Jeff Bridges for Darksied. They both are great actors.",3
Man!!! Jeff Bridges has an amazing voice and would do a phenomenal job. He‚Äôs a great actor worthy of Darkseid!   I‚Äôm all in on this!,2
I have always fancied Charles Dance as Darkseid.,2
"Denzel Washington (who has historically stayed away from big franchises) would be a huge get for whichever company, Marvel or DC, manages to snatch him up. Darkseid would be a strong proposition (the equivalent Marvel offer would probably be something like Magneto).",1
Allow me to add Javier Bardem to that list  Dude is an amazing chameleon and I have no doubts he'd play Darkseid with the gravitas and power he'd deserve.  Plus dude kinda looks like him,2
Issacs: Your Justice League were miserable fools!  Bridges: Steppenwolf created these Boom tubes in a city! With a box of mothers!  Washington: Superman ain't got no sh\*t on me!  I'm using these characters 'catchphrases to imagine what Darkseid would say if played by these actors.,1
All good choices.  Though Darkseid is such a hard character to cast.  Then again I‚Äôd love if Michael Ironsides came back to voice him again. He was too prefect.,2
Christopher Judge or bust.,2
"Danzel would be a interesting, fresh casting.",1
"My dream has always been James Earl Jones or Ron Perlman as Darkseid.  But honestly, Jeff Bridges is a great choice too and one I‚Äôll support!",1
Michael Ironside pls,1
Daniel Craig for this guy,1
Can I propose Arnold Schwazeneger (or whatever it's written) To this role???,1
Ray Porter as voice and CGI body,1
Face/motion/voice  Solved,1
Nah Denzel would never do Darkseid and hide behind CG.,1
Michael Ironside is the only correct answer,0
"Considering Ray Porter was cast and cut out of JL, I feel like he deserves another chance. Failing that, Christopher Judge from God of War would be perfect for him.",0
I could actually buy this   Especially since Steppenwolf was Ciaran (Like imagine them having a scene together),2
I cant read comics without hearing him as Darkseid or the dude who did Mongul was also amazing.,1
Second.  Ironside is too perfect a Darkseid. He can be large and threatening and yet scheming and petty at the same time.,1
That would be fantastic!,1
"I really hope he does a full pass on the color scheme and post-processing as well, so we get the desaturated gritty look of the screenshots. The whole compositions and lighting look awesome in BW.   The original was just too artificial, which made most CG scenes look like a toystore.   If this is getting toned down, its gonna give the movie a completely different vibe.",3
Damn I hadn't seen some of these. Cheers.   The one of Supes first flight 2.0 is literally exactly what I hoped for his return. Like shot for shot.  I need that scene.   Hell I just want all of Clark/Supes scenes.,3
It‚Äôs a different movie entirely,3
That first shot is Arthur talking with Vulko and Mera. Warning him of Orm and the threat coming to the surface. Arthur dismisses them to go see his father. This ending would have perfectly preceeded the solo Aquaman movie but Vulko's look is totally different. More like the concept art released by Michael Wilkinson.,2
"That Batman image with the smoke/vents, just wow",3
This is great. Hope you keep adding to this album as more are released OP.,2
That shot of Flash with the Sun behind him looks amazing,1
We were robbed.,1
"I'm gonna save it, thank you",2
what could have been ...,2
Martha turns into the Martian Manhunter? Interesting,1
At the very least it will have the color scheme of the early trailers. That's a massive step up from the visual vomit of the theatrical cut.,3
Dude. So sick,1
I will!,1
Who then turns into General Swanwick.,1
"No kidding. The theatrical cut looks like early 90s CG or something Schumacher would have done in photoshop. I can sympathize with a director seeing his artwork being slaughtered this way. Im guessing someone in marketing got the idea of making more like ""marvel"" and then pushed up the saturation to max.",2
Also their choice on color led to a nice contrast of rich vs poor when Arthur and Bruce meet for the first time. They are both wearing the same exact color outfits only Bruce‚Äôs looks more expensive and Arthur‚Äôs more raggedy.,3
"A decade from now, they can use this as inspiration for a teenage Joker who fumbles that idiotic bleach challenge while wearing his favorite red hoodie.",3
I wish this was in the movie,2
That‚Äôs not a red hood. People need to stop reaching,0
Not saying it‚Äôs literally a red hood. I know it‚Äôs a hoodie. But it‚Äôs nice to see the writers had that in mind before stripping away the more obvious references,3
The script literally says the words ‚ÄúRed Hood‚Äù.,3
"Really proud of everyone who joined the fight. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut   Personally, it was extremely inspiring and fulfilling to see that tremendous burst of positive energy and support.",3
‚ÄúHenry Cavill‚Äôs agent‚Äù got me real good,3
"""PORTALS"" theme goes great with everything.",3
DC sub got a shout out,3
"""Dave Bautista"" was so spot on",2
lol at dave bautista. but what did irons say in support of the snyder cut ? didnt he dislike bvs ?,1
Doesn't load,1
"I know I‚Äôll be in the minority but the more I see clips of endgame, the more I‚Äôm glad I never saw the movie.",0
Criiinge,0
‚ô•Ô∏è,2
understandable if you don‚Äôt care about mcu movies,3
"Boo, it's a nice moment",3
I watched 3 times in a span of 24 hours. Never watching it again üòÜ,1
"Law of diminishing returns in this scene. The Avengers assembling in New York for the first time is more iconic and impactful to me. This is cool, no doubt, but by this point it feels more like fan service than a great moment in movies. Thanos just stands there and lets everyone ride in and do their superhero poses which is pretty silly.",2
"You really should man, I loved every moment of it - Me and my friends were shouting like crazy during the 3rd act",2
"You should, it's a great movie.",1
The best moment of the film (not counting those with Thor and Antman),1
"Honestly mate. It was the most dumbest final√©. The fact this movie is number 1 grossing in the world is a joke. One guy here said 'its a nice moment'. Yup, and the rest of the 3hrs and 20mins was not worth it. It had next to no action in as well. Poor show. But, INFINITY WAR. that is the one!!.",0
It isn't that great.,0
I'd kill for the DC Equivalent of IW/Endgame :/,0
Boo every1 hating on you bc you dont share that what a great movie was that shitty endfuck,0
Sorta,0
Thank you. Just that scene alone was not for me. I can see the appeal but it‚Äôs just seems like over saturation of CGI,0
That‚Äôs literally every third act in a comic book movie,2
"What abou another joke, Murray?",1
"Yes, their support is huge. I‚Äôd say it increased the chances of us actually getting the cut.",3
it already has  it has gone mainstream because of their interaction,3
"Gal did not pursuade WB to fire Brett Ratner, her team put out a statement saying so (because the last thing an actor needs is to look like a egotistical diva just because they've had one success).  The endorsements are great for media coverage, but people should be wary of ascribing too much power to actors like Gal and Jason. Yes, they're in successful movies, but those movies are big IPs already so a studio can say 'we could have put anyone in that role and been successful'. For them to have true power they have to prove they are independently successful, like Ben Affleck, or Margot Robbie, or Joaquin Phoenix (if he wants to flex that power).  At the moment they're in the same boat as non-RDJ/Scarlett Johansson Marvel actors. Those guys have billion dollar movies regularly, but they have trouble opening other movies on their name alone.  Of course on the positive side them being allowed to tweet the tag suggests there isn't any sort of aggressive 'No one on our payroll is allowed to mention how badly we did with JL' rule.",1
If WB doesn‚Äôt want to release it at all then absolutely not.,2
"Definitely. The media didn't care when regular people on twitter demanded it, but news agencies being able to have headlines like ""Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot call for WB to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut"" definitely helps.",2
"All that matters is Gal and Ben tweeted, they would never have done that if they thought it wasnt coming. No way those tweets where just support.",1
"Gal and Jason I think are the two big pressure points. They're the two biggest DC stars right now. Meaning WB can't be as vindictive as they usually would be. Leaving them only two options:  1. Continue to plug their ears and yell ""I'm not listening, I'm not listening"" 2. Release it  The former can't work forever.",1
"The more support, the more awareness and demand for the film. Once WB see's that there is demand, they will put a plan in place to release the SnyderCut.",1
Off the top of my head   Henry Cavill   Joss Whedon (which I think is more likely than many think)  J.K Simmons   Ezra Miller,1
The think is WB doesn‚Äôt flinch and doesn‚Äôt seem like they will.,2
"Unless Gal and Jason are refusing to work with WB on future films unless the cut is released, then I'm not sure why they are pressure points. They tweeted support because they probably want to see the original film they worked on released, and because they love and support Zack. But there is nothing to suggest that they are pressuring WB on a personal level, lol.  Also, I'd add Joaquin Phoenix to the conversation of biggest star, because of the incredible run Joker has had. But I think you're right though, Gal and Jason are probably still ahead.",2
It definitely can. Gal and Jason are not pressure points at all. It‚Äôs not like they are refusing to work with WB or something. A simple hashtag from Gal isn‚Äôt going to pressure WB into anything.,2
I think it would be great if Jason did the same on that day. He's been vocal about it but his push on the same day would've added a lot more buzz and pressure.,1
"Idk. Joss hates Nolan's movies already, I don't think he'll ever even give respect to a second of Snyder footage.  Ezra doesn't have social media.",2
"I doubt Ezra Miller's support for RTSC will make a difference because he isn't all that valuable to WB. Miller's performance isn't as universally acclaimed and he hasn't proven himself as a bankable solo lead. In contrast, WB would care more about Gal's opinions because she headlined Wonder Woman to great success. Miller isn't valuable enough that WB would care about his opinions. The harsh truth is movie executives only listen to creators that are useful to them.",0
"Idk man, I think this a publicity stunt that was planned to gain some traction for a cut release",1
They sure as hell flinched when BVS dropped and that's how we got into this mess in the first place,1
"To be fair, even when WB decides to release it (Yes, WHEN), it'll take time for us to actually know. We don't know what effect Sunday had.",1
Any reference for the Nolan thing?  I never heard of that before and would be curious to look into that. I don‚Äôt doubt it just curious,1
"Agreed. I don't think Gal and Ben would drop that tag (and ONLY that tag, they didn't have anything else to say) unless it was allowed and possibly even encouraged by WB.",1
Yeah seems too coordinated,1
[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EFkW5cuW4AEwMyB?format=jpg&name=small](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EFkW5cuW4AEwMyB?format=jpg&name=small),1
Oh wow   Obviously couldn‚Äôt disagree with him more. Jeez I‚Äôm glad Whedon isn‚Äôt touching Batman again,1
Perhaps Whedon himself forgot how much mess of a film Age of Ultron is. Haha. He even tried to create cheesy romance between Hulk and Blackwidow which is outright disgusting.,1
"It's ironic seeing Whedon say someone else has ""meh filmmaking"". Whedon's actual skill peaked with Firefly and it's just downhill from there. Especially compared to Nolan who is considered by both the auteur circles and the mainstream as one of the greatest directors of our time.",0
Those are not Whedon‚Äôs words.,2
He can't break his NDA like Jason thats for sure,3
Was Ray Porter supposed to voice to voice Darkseid in the 5-arc JL or he was the actor that would play him in the same way Josh Brolin played Thanos?,2
Ray Porter looks like a rockstar.  **For Darkseid**,2
"I figure that virtually all of the cast has some form of NDA. Maybe some of them have enough clout within the DCEU and WB to break it or mess with it, and others don't. Either way, it's still great to see so many fans asking for Snyder's vision of Justice League.",1
What does NDA means ?,2
How long are these fucking NDA's? Lol,2
When the NDA stops and that‚Äôs I believe( in this case around 10 years) then WB might actually address and release this movie.,0
He better start buttering up Ava if he wants to still be Darkseid.,0
voice actor. Darkseid would be CGI,2
"He probably was to some extent, but really hes just another Dan Amboyer trying to get his 5 seconds of fame online. Like the bait clip he posted that was obviously voiced by Ciaran Hinds leading snyder cut enthusiasts to say it was Darkseid.",1
Non-Disclosure Agreement. Basically stops them from discussing stuff that is either in production or going to be in production. It's a way to stop leaks until the production company is ready for them.,2
"i would assume indefinitely, WB doesn‚Äôt want any information getting out that they don‚Äôt approve of",3
"Ava seems way too headstrong to want to go along with anyone else's direction, even if it was fantastic (and I don't think even the most vehement Snyder anti-fans disagree with most of his and his team's castings). That's why I want the SC to come out soon, so there might be some public support behind keeping a couple of the castings.   I also very much want Sofia Boutella involved - she was seemingly involved but was cut out when the Whedoning happened to JL.",2
Yeah I can't see the trailer speak being anyone but Steppenwolf  At best it was Desaad he spoke to.  Also does Darkseid even have any lines in the Snyder Cut aside from the ending?,1
"NDAs are never indefinite (even though they can be). the longest for one project is 7/10 years but that's rare. Standard is 2/3 years. Sometimes it is not just about NDAs but just being industry savvy. At the end of the day,  if you still wanna work in the town you might not wanna be known for spilling things when circumstances don't go your way. Based on certain people who jumped into the Snyder Cut movement over the weekend,  I'm willing to wager it has actually passed at this point",3
"Really Sofia was involved in it, mate do you have a source, proof or is this a rumor?",1
"Oh good point. Even if on paper it expires, burning a bridge might be irrevocable.",2
Doubt its true. This sub has a boner for Sofia Boutella and Ana de Armas,1
"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw0vKkHgC9V/  Possible that she's just friends with them and was out with them for a meal / drinks just in a social context, but this was during production of Justice League. So it's rumor but rumor with a decent basis.",1
"Right you are,  sir!",1
"That's not a proof mate, you implied that Whedon cut her from the movie is there any specific scene that she's in or is it a cameo? And if it was surprise role for her they would be vigilant about that group photo.",1
"That's why I said she was ""seemingly"" involved. She was potentially meant to be one of Darkseid's crew, seen through the boomtube at the end when the league look up after Steppenwolf's head is cut off. But yeah, that's speculation.  I never said it was proof. That's also why I caveat my last comment with it being a ""rumor"". Just offering a basis for speculation.",1
I like this more than the JL one.,3
"While I prefer Steppenwolf look more like the comics, I think this is a really great design that‚Äôs in between Snyder‚Äôs design and the comics. The armor looks great.",3
Seeing the model really gives me better appreciation for the design. I know many prefer the Kirby design but to me it is something so alien and removed from my idea of the New Gods I can't help but think that some would look like a monster especially on a Apokalips.   My main criticism with this design was that he was gonna be another grey colour scheme villain and after Zod Doomsday Ares and Enchantress at this point I'd have loved to have seen his armour at least have motifs to his comic book colours.,3
"I would just about shit my pants if I saw that in person.   I know people had problems with the deviation from the comics Steppenwolf, but man I really dig the more alien look. Hopefully this is what he looks like in the Snyder Cut.",3
I wonder why they didn‚Äôt just make him look like Steppenwolf.,3
"His design in JL made his helmet even more [alien-looking](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d4/e3/80/d4e38004bd8467b907954105cf40e86e.jpg), but he had the same basic silhouette as what's seen here.",3
"Ngl, when I was watching Titans, I thought Ezai Morales would‚Äôve looked good as Steppenwolf if they made him look comic accurate. But I prefer this design",2
We were going to get a full blown cosmic horror take on the justice league with epic action but wb wanted the lmao marvel money,3
I feel like this is the perfect middle ground between the comics design and the concept art we saw where he looks even more alien.,3
Steppenwolf has such a stupid face in Justice League. It's laughable and ridiculous.,3
This one is more scarier than the one shown in JL..,1
We were robbed of Snyder‚Äôs ‚Äúhorror‚Äù approach (as he called it) to the apokoliptians. We could‚Äôve had something truly unique smh.,3
Now this! Looks like a villain for the justice league!.,3
An improvement to the one we got who looked so thin.,3
While still don't like it it's better than what we got.,2
It's like a Doom Cyber-Demon. I love it.,1
"Eh, in my opinion, full Kirby or bust. They should have just put Cirian Hinds in armour, or hell put him in the classic green Steppenwolf costume. Hinds is a world class actor, and they made him look weird.",3
Imo  Comic Design > This Design > Justice League Design,2
"Wow, he has like an actual design and isn't just an uglified Loki. This is actually pretty cool.",2
The same people that are praising this ridiculous departure from the source material by changing the whole DESIGN  are the same people that pretend to be disappointed with Birds of Prey because the characters don‚Äôt have their  OUTFITs from the comics.  Nerd hypocrisy will always amaze me.,2
Awful generic CG grey monster #456744,2
I prefer this version ober the theatrical one I dont know why they decided to change his design.  That being said I still wish they had at least given him the red hilights to his armor he has on the new 52 version instead of an all grey design,1
This is still awful though. Doomsday looked like shit too. The images are right in the comics to pull from. I don‚Äôt know why they made them so awful.,0
"I prefer this more ""smoother"" look than the final jagged/busy version.",1
I prefer the Theatrical design (Fight me) but I'kll be damned if that helmet's horns look cooler then OtherWolf's,0
unpopular opinion I guess but I prefer the design we ended up getting. At least that one is semi comic accurate. This just looks too alien imo,0
Same. I like how DCEU's antagonists aren't humans painted with blue or green in Walmart helmets like the MCU.,2
Unfortunately steppenwolf in the snyder cut is the same as the justice league version.,3
I think the idea was to make him look like Darkseid since they‚Äôre supposed to be related.,1
That is personally my favourite design of Steppenwolf.,3
That looks horrendous.,0
It hurts my soul,3
And failed epically at getting it with this movie,3
How is this Cosmic Horror at all?,2
"""cosmic horror"" lol",1
"""scary monster"" + ""from space"" =/= cosmic horror.",0
"This guy understands. Bless you, my man.",2
This doesn‚Äôt make any sense.,0
You know shits about to go down,1
"i think he needed to be cg no matter what, even with a more humanoid appearance.",3
He is pretty old to play step in live action though,2
"May it be Whedon or Snyder, I fully agree.  Even for budgetary reasons: the guy is a dude with a beard, shiny eyes and a badass armor. I can‚Äôt even begin to describe how much budget it would have said in this already expensive film if they just went with that.",2
I maintain the movie design could be handled by a man in costume (Even if you want someone tall you'e got Conan Stevens and the like who can do that),0
"Which one? OG, Post Crisis or New 52",1
Real G here.,2
Quite an assumption.,2
And they conveniently just forget how would this affect the whole new gods mythology  I mean why would only Step look that way?,1
Your critique is way more generic than this design would ever hope to be.,2
"Yes, some red highlights would have been nice.",1
There is a Steppenwolf toy that had grey and red colors on it.,1
"No one is gonna fight you, dude lmao",2
"I‚Äôm not going to go that far. I enjoy what Marvel does as well, I just hoped that WB would let Snyder continue with his vision.",3
"Yea, thank God we've got fantastic villain design like Lex Luthor, Doomsday and Ares.",2
"What helmets are you talking about , Marvel's villans have been absolutely amazing the past couple of years.ü§£ü§£ü§£",2
Walmart helmets? No need to put down the MCU to make the DCEU appear better.,2
"Shame.   Hopefully the CGI would be a little bit improved, maybe some added colour because the grey look is dull as fuck.",2
"It can be changed if they really wanted to show that the Snyder Cut is very different. I talked with my VFX friend of my, he said it would take 40-60 million dollars to have a new Steppenwolf design.",0
"Idk how this design makes him look more like Darkseid lol, aside from them both being grey I guess? This Steppenwolf looks like a shark with bobby pins all over him.",1
"Love this design, he looks damn scary!",2
He's a bit Bayformers looking isn't he?,0
"People seem to need this movie to be impossibly good, it's really weird.",2
It‚Äôs if you‚Äôre 11.,0
The version in the movie looked really thin to me.,3
"I agree, but it would have taken considerably LESS cgi if they just went with [this design](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dcmovies/images/e/e9/Steppenwolf_JLG%26M.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/280?cb=20151007145750).   Sure, it's not super scary or intimidating, but Hinds would have definitely made it up by adding gravitas to the character, since he could be more expressive with his face.",1
I agree with Jeremy.,1
That was a joke,1
"I just like General Zod's, BvS and JL concept Steppenwolf's and Doomsday's design (during the movie Doomsday was evolving to his spikey form). Ares design was generic, reminded me of MCU villains, Shazam's was eh, and Aquaman's was alright, pretty comic accurate tho.",0
"Well the lightning isn't red, it's dark so it hides the terrible CGI a bit but makes it more dull. It's still better than the red lightning.",2
And what are the odds that such an effort results in something similar to what we witnessed with their attempt to cover up a mustache?,2
Pretty much that‚Äôs the only similarity lol. Steppenwolf in the comics is not exactly the most exciting villain and doesn‚Äôt have the most exciting design either so I guess they wanted to redesign him from the ground up that fits the hellish landscape of Apokolips and Darkseid‚Äôs design. I was fine with the final design besides the wonky CGI. I thought they managed to somewhat capture his comic design but still have a unique flair that shows he‚Äôs actually related to Darkseid.,1
"You can praise the DCEU, but you don‚Äôt have to shit on the MCU to do it. It‚Äôs unnecessary and feels very ‚Äúlittle brother‚Äù of you.",2
Totally different cases. No comparison.,0
"Sure, dude. It is just an opinion, relax.",0
Not really   We‚Äôre talking taking something out of a good part of the cut which requires entirely new texturing and probably some modded animations.   Plus as you said it‚Äôs probably taking 40-50 million to do just that which is an unnecessary cost considering they already may need to touch up some things.   This ignoring the fact they already have one they put time and money into,2
"Well said. They would rather put that 40 million to refine the unfinished VFX. I guess we won't be getting a different design for Steppenwolf. We might not even get the Snyder Cut. But, personally, it isn't the Snyder Cut if it doesn't even have Snyder's fav design in it.",0
"""The Cape is in the closet. It's still MINE.""    Words that almost word-for-word mimic that of his agent when she tweeted in response to the Hollywood Reporter article that Cavill was out.  And it's clear he still WANTS to be it. So f#%#ing let him!   I mean, it'd be one thing if he wanted to go like Batfleck. But Cavill wants to stay. He loves the character, knows him inside and out, looks the part more than any living human being on the planet, and has the commitment and the chops to play him.  It's unfathomable that WB won't just keep him.",3
Oh please... Let this mean something good...  We want MOS 2!!,3
">*Man of Steel*? ‚ÄúA great starting point. If I were to go back, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd change anything.‚Äù *Batman v Superman*? ‚ÄúVery much a Batman movie. And I think that realm of darkness is great for a Batman movie.‚Äù *Justice League*? ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt work.‚Äù  And he's on our side.",3
WB's neglect towards the character is upsetting. They should give Cavill one more shot.   Affleck's case was different since he was going through personal troubles and already 45 plus.  Cavill is in the peak of his life. Pity if they don't give him a Superman movie in near future.,3
">Yet some have suffered for Cavill‚Äôs intense love of the gym. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say we ‚Äòworked out‚Äô so much as I acted as Henry‚Äôs trainer,‚Äù jokes costar Ben Affleck of their time on *Batman v Superman.* ‚ÄúI really had to help him increase muscle mass‚Äîbefore my coaching, he looked like Gumby.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúIn all honesty, we did work out together. And I *hated* it.‚Äù  Lol.  (But sad we didn't get to see their Batman/Superman friendship play out properly).",3
"I‚Äôve always said that the main difference between Affleck‚Äôs status and Cavill‚Äôs status was that one actually wants to keep doing it. The other was ready to move on.  Sounds like Affleck was ready to go for a very long time. He may not have been totally happy with the Superman movies he got, but We‚Äôve never heard a lick about Cavill being ‚Äòunsatisfied‚Äô with being Superman, and that‚Äôs the main reason why I didn‚Äôt want to say that he was probably gonna leave as well.   Does this mean he‚Äôs staying? No. But it confirms that he‚Äôs still interested in doing it, and that‚Äôs already a better starting point then what we had with Affleck. It would be different if Cavill stayed mum on this subject.",3
"So.. Him not being in Shazam, for once, was literally just a scheduling conflict?? That wasn't a lie?",3
There‚Äôs still hope!,3
If my wife cheated on me with Henry Cavill I would high five her,3
"""You will give the people of  Earth an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will  stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun, Henry.""",3
Thank God. This guy is literally Superman for so many people,3
This makes my heart go wild.,2
The Shazam bit made me sad. Would have been so cool to see Cavil in that end scene,2
The S means hope. We should have some.,3
"He's a great Superman, we just need better writing for him. I can't wait for the future of DCEU. I hope they won't make a new Justice League until Green Lantern is introduced. I really hope we get to see Henry Cavill then.",3
Hes been saying the same thing for 2 almost 3 years now....,2
"Love ya Henry, you're a great symbol of hope. Very excited for the Witcher too.",2
Come on....just get this done WB!  They have the perfect casting for Superman right in front of their faces....Get. It. Done.,2
"Slightly cryptic but more positive than not. Despite things I've said in the past and frustrations with the franchise, I still have hope. I'm rooting for you Mr. Cavill. I eagerly await your return to the big screen as the Man Of Tomorrow.",2
STILL my Superman,2
"I fucking knew it. They called me insane, but I knew...I always knew.",3
YASSSS!,2
"Thank the lord he is still in and invested in the project, hopefully they announce a new project",2
Please come back at least for the Shazam movies. Also MOS 2 would be great,2
"FUCK YEAH, THIS JUST MADE MY DAY!",2
We seriously need to be pushing for Cavill to remain as Superman as hard as the community is pushing for the Snyder  Cut. Superman is central to the DC Universe and Cavill is the perfect casting of this generation. Superman has to return. Continue his story.,2
Finally....so can you all stop with the ‚Äúwho would you cast as superman now that Henry is out‚Äù posts. He is superman.,3
I feel like after the Witcher tv show is out and if it's good then maybe WB could see that he can hold his own franchise.  I really like Cavill he's a great modern Superman he just didn't click with people (me included) but let's hope he gets to wear the cape again.,3
And a big farewell to the ‚ÄúHenRys GoNe/ MoVeD on‚Äù people.,2
"Remember, WB tried to negotiate a new deal with Henry and tried to get him to cameo in Shazam, this isn't all on WB. We don't know what kind of demands Henry and his team may have made, and whether or not they were reasonable. Neither side has been willing to budge all these months later, that says a lot.",2
"I just love this. Some people were thinking that Henry was the ‚Äúsmart one‚Äù by not siding with Snyder, but apparently he preferred what Snyder did than what WB did with JL lol",2
Yes Henry! Keep fighting to stay on!,2
This is probably why he didn‚Äôt say anything during the week. So he doesn‚Äôt ruffle any feathers that he needs on his side. But isn‚Äôt it a coincidence that this article comes out right after the Snyder cut weekend? üòä,1
I want MOS sequel.,1
"to me, this feels like cavill passive agressively screaming to WB saying ''let me do another damn superman movie!'' the dude clearly loves the role and your barely doing anything with it, its not insulting cavill at all, he really loves playing superman, and he seems to love playing geralt in the upcoming witcher series so we know he takes roles that he actively wants, this seems like he's telling the fans ''ill let you know when they do another movie, cause i know you want more and i want more''",1
"This is a disgrace, and everyone involved should be ashamed.  How did they manage to leave his shirt on for an entire Men's Health spread!!! üòã  Good news on the DCEU front though. He's always gonna be my live action Superman, and so the knowledge that we'll be getting more of him has me smiling this afternoon.",1
"I don‚Äôt understand why SB won‚Äôt give Cavill another Superman movie, but they would for WW, Aquaman, and Flash.",1
"I think I'm okay with Ben not being Batman anymore because he didn't want to. But if WB decides to reboot Superman without Henry, who still very much wants to keep playing Supes, then I'd be pissed.",2
LETS,2
Amazing. I really hope this means something. Great to hear he‚Äôs never lost his passion for the role. And probably the only reason he hasn‚Äôt said anything about the RTSC on Instagram is that he‚Äôs negotiating and playing it safe with WB.,1
"Good. He's a great Superman. I'd be ok with the character shelved for awhile to give the other heroes some time to shine, but Henry should absolutely stay in the role.",1
I'll take that as a 80% yes,1
This is my Superman! Hope we see him again!,1
Fantastic. He's not out and it hasn't been communicated to him that he is out. Now DC/WB needs to get their collective shit together so we can get MOS2. I don't see why this has to be so damn difficult.,1
Cavill still wants to play Superman while WB is content to let him sit it out for the time being. I'm really glad we've got this millionth article that confirms what we've known for years.,1
We need Henry back  can't have the DCEU without the Man of Steel himself c'mon WB do ur damn thing give this man his proper sequel,1
I'm Glad he's not giving up. Hes got so much potential.,1
Bruh this made my day. He truly is the Man of Steel!,1
It breaks my heart of all the amazing possibilities that could be and then seeing nothing.,1
u/AngryJoeShow,1
"WHAT ARE YOU IDIOTS WAITING FOR?! JUST MAKE THE FUCKING MOVIE, THE MAN WANTS TO DO IT!",1
I‚Äôm so happy to hear him say that,1
"Well, at least there‚Äôs comfort knowing that he actually really cares about the character and wants it done right. Class act, that Henry Cavill. Can‚Äôt wait for the Witcher series to come out as well, looks badass!",1
Costner's tornado scene aside I throughly enjoyed Man of Steel.,1
Too bad it's not up to him :(,1
I want man of steel 2 to have bizzaro in it,1
Aka: I gots bills to pay,1
*don‚Äôt give me hope*,2
"What i absolutely hate about WB is that they never say shit about shit. They don‚Äôt just straight up tell you what is going on, there is never an official announcement. If we are never going to see the Snyder Cut just say so. If Henry Cavill is completely out just say so. I don‚Äôt like being left in the dark. That being said, Henry Cavill NEEDS to be Superman. There is only one man on earth for the job.",1
"I hated him when I saw the first Photo of him as Superman. I hated him when I saw him as Geralt in the Witcher for the first time. I never thought too highly of his Superman performance. But I was wrong on many things, liked what I have seen about the Witcher. I genuinly think that he can act better than what I have seen in Man of Steel and BvS. So I will learn from my previous mistakes of judging to hastly and only see what is given, an actor who wants to do justice for a role, who cares for the role he will portray, who wants another shot at it. I will be open minded and hope that something nice will spawn out of that.",1
"Even though I have mixed feelings about the movies, Henry Cavill is still the best Superman so far",1
HELL YEA,1
Encouraging!,1
You don't owe this role anything. You already gave it everything you've got. Henry Cavill: Not everything. Not yet.,1
Awsome! Hope he loses the stache this time lol.,1
im going with the theory WB is trying to wash their hands of anything synder related,1
"I don‚Äôt want him to go. I love his Superman and I know with the right script, he can make things happen. I would absolutely love a Superman story with him, Lois and John. Take the latest Rebirth run.",1
So glad to hear this from him,1
So you‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs a chance?  https://giphy.com/gifs/jim-carrey-dumb-and-dumber-so-youre-telling-me-theres-a-chance-ToMjGpKniGqRNLGBrhu,1
If that‚Äôs truly his attitude then for the life of me I can‚Äôt understand how he and the studio haven‚Äôt been able to reach a fair deal.   These are those times you would love to know what the hell is going on behind the scenes?  Superman has always been the face of DC and you have someone that ‚Äúseemingly‚Äù loves playing the character and all involved can‚Äôt find a way to make it work? That‚Äôs a darn shame!,1
why is it taking so long to develop another superman film. wtf WB.,1
All-Star Superman,1
‚ÄúVibe Check‚Äù,1
"I would have thought he's been in the business long enough to have decent connections. So if he's so passionate about it and thinks theirs so much more to give, maybe he could team with a writer and produce a script. Ezra was doing the same for Flash.",1
"Henry is such a beast of a Superman. The great suit, the body... sadly they nerfed wonder woman in JL. That was a fight I was looking for",1
"If Henry Cavill does get recast as superman for the dcu, they should make a kingdom come elseworlds movie with Cavill as Supes.",1
"Its abundantly clear WB is first and foremost interested in a good story, they arent rushing to meet the needs of fanboys like the rush to make bvs, this is why the joker movie happened and ultimately became a success. If a director comes around with a good superman script, WB would be game, and if said director wants to use or recast cavill so be it. Unpopular Opinion but Cavill looks the part, perhaps more than any other actor who has ever played superman, but i worry if he can play the part as well as tom welling or christopher reeves, it remains to be seen.",1
Was there ever a question of him not wanting it ? Wasn't it just that he wants too much money ?,1
RED SON,1
https://i.imgur.com/urD6yjA.jpg,1
"Do a flash movie and then a flashpoint sequel that allows Robert Pattinson to be in the movie universe moving forward, start a new Superman trilogy with Cavill thats a few years after Justice league in a universe after flashpoint.  It can be a soft reboot for him and he can be established already, build out the regular cast of superman characters like Supergirl, Connor and/or Jon, recast Lex (explain it as a flashpoint thing if you want).  Not many better ways I can think of to course correct this unless they wanna build to a crisis but I feel that can be saved for down the road.  No reboots please. Fans don't need reboots. People know these characters enough they dont need more origins. Marvel has shown how much more fun these movies get when things are more established and the universe is built.",1
I‚Äôll suck anyone‚Äôs dick if WB completes the man of steel trilogy no cap,1
"I would love a bright and wholesome Superman movie starring Cavill. Especially if it was connected in some small, or hopefully big, way to Shazam.",1
"got no dog in this fight, but I read a few collections in my formative years.  All-Star Superman is, to me, a definitive take that encompasses all the good generalization of this archetypal messianic character; it's King Arthur, it's the Passion. I don't see superhero movies because I think capes are stupid, but I don't think anyone writing these films is really trying to say anything.   I enjoyed Man of Steel (haven't seen any of these DC movies since) because the ending made sense to me, when he snaps Zod's neck - our ancient tradition of the hero is one who must kill the beast rampaging through the community to protect even those who doubt his ability to overcome the creature.",1
"Ik it probably sounds easier saying then doing but wouldn‚Äôt decannonizing anything with batfleck in it be the easiest way to soft reboot the franchise while keeping the great actors and the movies that have worked... it would still give us Henry Cavill as Supes, Gal Gadot as WW, Etc.,, and the great movies (IMO: MoS, WW, AM, Shazam)  stay while the BvS, JL, And SS of the world are now gone (in my opinion, awful movies) ... my only reservation about this is that this would allow the Patterson Batman to be the new Batman in the universe and I‚Äôm personally unsure if that cast of characters will fit in with the rest of the universe but I can be 100% wrong on that case.",1
I knew that he never left people just kept believing in it,1
He could be really great if he had a half decent script.,1
I just hope he gets a cloth suit. That would be badass,1
This is why the MCU is vastly better. Commitment to their plan until the ENDGAME. *pun intended,0
WB: Ok Boomer! /s,0
"Me: DONT.  Henry: Don't what?  Me: Don't give me HOPE.  Henry: Thats what Superman is about, my friend. Hope.  Me: (Starts jizzing in pants at the Chadness of Cavill)",0
Now we have to find him a new director.,0
The only people who talk about him being out as Superman are the fans.  I see everyone saying to let him be Superman and give him another chance.  Literally no one official has said that wasn‚Äôt the case.,0
"I‚Äôll say it. Time for a new Superman , Henry is... as emotive as a brick wall",0
He‚Äôs out. Just sounds like it more and more.  I‚Äôm glad he has The Witcher.,0
I am not a fan of the movies he has done as Supes but I do like him and hope he gets another chance with new director(s)/writer(s),0
Henry Cavill got screwed over the most with the theatrical cut of Justice League. He should be the biggest promoter and supporter of #ReleaseTheSnyderCut so WB can redeem that movie.,0
That's our Superman!   \#ReleaseSnyderCut   Gimme that MoS sequel with Brainiac that we've all been waiting for!,0
Bring him back and keep Snyder the ffff away from DC and I'll be happy,0
"Love MOS and BVS DOJ UE, but i dont think henry is intrested in this beyond the pay, he backs up the popular opinion and i felt he wants that Geoff Vibe , lets see who lands MOS 2 or Superman movie going frw and if they are down with HC",0
"Goddamn it I want see him as Superman again. I love Man of Steel, but BvS was just a bad movie full stop. There where some really good performances in BvS, but it was just wrong narratively. Justice League suffered from being the follow up to BvS. It's too bad because we got a glimpse of how good Cavill could be as Superman.",0
Hell yeah! Superman is back!,0
"I think DC‚Äôs plan is to use the crisis on infinite earths event in the DC shows to have an effect on the DCEU, which would be responsible for why many of the actors will be recast going forward",0
No reality where they cast a new Batman and keep the same Superman. I hate that Cavill got a raw deal as well but the headless Shazam cameo told us everything we feared...,0
To be honest it wouldn‚Äôt shock me at all if a reboot with Cavill was already in the early stages of being developed.,3
Didn't know it was Affleck's decision to leave the role. Guess he got tired of the hate? I personally liked his batman üò•,3
I think it's more than just Cavill wanting to come back and WB being weird. Its possible that he wants more control over the movie. He had a take that the producer from Mission Impossible was interested in. Same boat as Ezra Miller,1
He wants to stay but ultimately the decision is WB.,2
I've always felt hes great as superman. Like everyone his character needs better production and direction.i still think he should stay as superman.,1
>	looks the part more than any living human being on the planet  *Matt Bomer has entered the chat*,0
There were rumors of JJ Abrams doing a Superman movie. Take it with a grain of salt though.,3
I don't. Snyder didn't get Superman. Cavill wasn't the problem though. Always better to have someone who wants to do it,2
I don't want MoS 2 if Snyder isn't involved.,2
"Why make MoS2? I enjoyed the movie but Superman seriously needs a soft reboot, not a continuation of the bastard that is the DCEU.",0
amen!,0
"So a reiteration of what we always thought.   Cavill is immensely proud of MOS - he's said so numerous times both before and after the movie came out. ""I don't think I'd change anything"" about sums it up.   BvS was more frustrating for him as I'd imagine he felt a bit sidelined and was somewhat upset that Batman was kinda ""taking over"" the movie for him. And as much as I absolutely loved his arc in the film, I still lament that we didn't get to see more of classic Superman lore like his life at the Daily Planet, his romance with Lois and his Superman dealing with people on a more personalized level.  And JL was... Well... embarrassing. Especially for Cavill; a guy who is making a career off his good looks and leading man charisma... And his face looks like a human ogre for 90% of the film. Not to mention that, as a character arc, his Superman becomes a literal caricature of what the studio thinks audiences wanted moreso than a natural progression of where he started from in that Superman, as a person who has had a life/death experience, grows to really appreciate his life after coming back from the dead, so he naturally becomes more upbeat and happy.  The culmination of his arc should have (and likely would have if Snyder's movie got released) been the embodiment of Superman's thoughts at the conclusion of the Return of Superman comic story.  ""I should feel tired, but I don't. All I want to do is fly. I'm rejuvenated in a way I never thought possible. I have no idea what's coming next, but I know whatever it is, I'll handle it better than ever!""",3
He has yet to rise.,3
Damn. I didn‚Äôt even like any of these 3 films yet his optimistic attitude is starting to change my opinion...Maybe he can still be a great Superman.,2
"The weird thing is JL is the best represention of Supes from the comics, it's just presented like shit with a fucked upper lip",2
"""You will give the fandom an ideal to strive towards. They will stumble, they will fall, but in the end, they will join you in the sun.""",1
But he aGreeD wiTh WhEdOn on SupErmaN!,0
They are actively looking for a director based on the rumors (by top trades),3
WB would have already been making one if they wanted him. Wouldn't be surprised if he gets dropped.,1
Their bit at the end of JL about the bank is pretty good.,3
"I mean, there were rumors during the making of BvS that Ben and Henry didn't ""like each other"". Which seemed ridiculous. But there were also reports that they would often work out together and compete with one another, which makes sense - and of course would probably aid them to get into character and ""hate"" each other. lol   Especially since Ben is outspoken about hating exercising.",3
"People forget though that Affleck more than likely was sold on a very specific vision, Synders vision. A darker more brutal take on batman. Ben only started to seem tapped out once JL reshoots started. Which is understandable because they completely changed his character in the reshoots. I think Affleck would have been happy to stay if they studio didn't start meddling. However I do think it is possible the pressure of a solo batman movie got to him. He was going through a rough patch in his life, and batman is a heavy obligation lol.",3
"‚ÄúBatman is the coolest f*cking part in any universe. I am so thrilled to do it. It is f*cking amazing...I would be an ape on the ground for Matt Reeves. It‚Äôs a great time in the DC universe, and you can see why I am so excited to play Batman.‚Äù-Ben Affleck, 2017.  Doesn't sound like he was ready to go",3
Affleck was also suffering from substance abuse. The stress of worrying about the franchise‚Äôs future wasn‚Äôt helping either.,2
Apparently according to the director and producer they couldn‚Äôt get Henry as they where filming on location in an actual school - for a small allotted time.,3
"It was never a lie, the ones who thought it was are those who think pessimism is synonymous with intelligence.",3
I called my girlfriend last night and Henry Cavill picked up the phone.,3
I‚Äôd be mad he got with her over me.,1
"The Avengers: Endgame writers have expressed interest, given what they did with Captain America I think that they would nail Superman.",2
Facts. He'll keep saying it until he can't because by then he would be recast lol.,2
"I seriously hope so! I hate reading those titles, it's depressing and not true.",2
"\>  he just didn't click with people (me included)       IMO, his version of Superman (Snyder's vision) was simply too depressed, angry and mopy. For those like me who grew up idolizing Superman in the  Justice League & Justice League Unlimited TV series, it felt off.       In Whedon's version, we see Superman smile and be playful for small glimpses. When he told Barry he was off the team if he lost the race, when he hugged & was happy to be back with Lois in the farm, when he joked with cyborg he was just getting used to be being alive, those short moments, it felt like the real Superman to me.     All in all to say that Henry is the perfect Superman.",3
This won't shut them up. Misinformation and hating on DC stuff go hand in hand.,2
"To be fair Henry and his manager can say he is still Superman till they are blue in the face but it doesn't mean anything if WB resist making another Superman film or resist having Superman appear in a film. I mean he was in Shazam yet Cavill wasn't there despite the ""cape still being in his closet"" or whatever. He is basically telling us what we already know; he hasn't been recast but WB are being cagey with the Superman character except on TV so he may as well be out as Superman. Nothing's changed. His statements literally mean ""nothing has changed"".",0
FUCKING,2
Because directors want to do other projects or characters. Here's to hoping the Abrams rumors are true,1
"They don‚Äôt have to. They never did and never will. It‚Äôs a movie studio, not a supermarket chain.",2
Then how do you explain Wonder Woman and Aquaman?,0
"Does he have a production company ? Maybe about time he took charge, front and center. Margot and Dwayne are doing it for their characters.",1
No. It's just a saying.,1
MCU is better because they had people who understand the property in charge.,0
Not everything is teams. Comparing is what drove things into the ground.,0
That phrase does not mean what you seem to think it means.,1
WB literally said they had no future plans for Superman as of now and they had someone else do the cameo in Shazam. That doesn't exactly point towards a future with Cavill as Superman.. Especially now that they're rebooting Batman with a new cast.,1
"Ok then I'll bite, I think Henry is perfect but who would you cast?",1
Imagine believing the actor is to blame when direction and the script were clearly the issues.,1
"I mean as stupid as it sounds, the stash was contractually obligated for Mission Impossible, and Paramount wasn‚Äôt willing to to shut down production (the Director was) or let WB pay for the CGI to add it back on.",1
Yep. Cavill deserved so much better.,0
"Justice League just suffered cause it was shit. Full stop. BvS, which I enjoyed, had nothing to do with that Frankenstein overcorrection.",1
What do you mean back???  His status is still in limbo.,1
"What's this ""DCEU"" you mention? I don't think such a thing exists.",1
Yeah man. Remember when they recast War Machine and had to make the impossible decision to also replace RDJ because if you recast one character you have to recast every one?,1
"Why a reboot, why not just carry on and adjust as necessary?",3
"If I am being honest I don't think Cavill is coming back, especially if it is a reboot. I don't see any reason for why WB would want to continue with him when they want erase Zack Snyder Dc movies from existence, and why would a new director want him as Superman when he could cast a new one and start fresh.",3
"I'd say a soft reboot would be good, Keep MoS, probably phase out BvS, and JL. Maybe retell the events of JL so that the death of Superman can be used again at some point and so that we don't have to have another JL movie where they're meeting for the first time.",1
"I liked his Batman, too. But as I recall he was taking the brunt of the criticism from WB and also not wanting to commit to the upcoming movies (now with Robert Pattinson). He wanted to keep his schedule open for other movies and felt like being Batman was going to be too time consuming.",1
He wants a producer's credit from what I've heard  A guy talked to him and Cavill mentioned wanting to have a more hopeful film with Brainiac,1
"However, ***IF*** that turns out to be true, I want Henry Cavill to return in that MOS 2. I'm sure we all do.",3
I hear abrams film is part of some sort of soft reboot with a different actor and i heard that it was said by reliable sources close to DC but what henry cavill is saying sounds very intresting,3
He tried to make one in 2002 called [Superman: Flyby.] (https://dcmovies.fandom.com/wiki/Superman:_Flyby),1
I‚Äôd love that. Was a huge fan of MoS.,1
*spits water* JJABRAMS?!!!,1
Aslongnas it's not Superman Flyby then I'll be kinda happy,1
Its for the rebooted DC cinematic universe,0
"Because JJ Abrams is the ONLY Director left in Hollywood. We can‚Äôt figure out how to end this Star Wars movie, lets bring in the guy that made Star Trek and couldn‚Äôt write and ending for Lost. (Cue the downvotes)",0
How did he not get Superman?  Why do you hold this opinion?  Please explain,1
Did you miss the part where he wants to reflect the comic books?,2
"see ya, because snyder is most definitely never coming back",2
"Depends if someone is respectfully following his films up, or if it's the kinda ""respectful following"" WB and Joss did after Snyder's losing a child, where they try as hard as possible to delete everything he did.  If it's the former, I'm in. If the latter, I might just be done with WB forever.",0
">And JL was... Well... embarrassing. Especially for Cavill; a guy who is making a career off his good looks and leading man charisma... And his face looks like a human ogre for 90% of the film.   Wow, it seems so obvious, but it never struck me before. Henry's looks are the foundation of his personal brand and WB's JL smudged them up.",3
"> BvS was more frustrating for him as I'd imagine he felt a bit sidelined and was somewhat upset that Batman was kinda ""taking over"" the movie for him. And as much as I absolutely loved his arc in the film, I still lament that we didn't get to see more of classic Superman lore like his life at the Daily Planet, his romance with Lois and his Superman dealing with people on a more personalized level.  I feel like one of BvS big problems was that the hole movie was just ""This is how much cooler and better Batman is compared to Superman"". Ben Afflecks Batman stole the show too much for me. But that is probably because Zack Snyder seems to be much better at directing more ground level and gritty heroes like Rorschach and Batman.",2
"> Cavill is immensely proud of MOS - he's said so numerous times both before and after the movie came out. ""I don't think I'd change anything"" about sums it up.   Don't you think there's a gap between ""immensely proud"" and ""I don't think I'd change anything""?",3
Fuck Lois. I like Amy Adams but her Lois was god awful. Just way too convenient to the plot. She seems to be able to teleport anywhere as the plot needed and just happened to be in the right place at the right time far too much. Hated it.,0
I guess they have interviews about Men's Health in kryptonian heaven.,3
***RIDE AINT OVER YET***  edit: what wrong did I say lmao I just quoted Cyborg,2
the thing is he was never the problem. he plays the superman character well and looks the part. the movie writing was usually bad tho,2
"Its not at all. Man of Steel is Earth One, BvS is Superman from Birthright/For Tommorow. JL is pretty much a caricature of Superman.",3
Have you read the comics? Not to be condescending but Superman is usually more somber in most of his comics rather than a smiling boy scout. I swear people think the Reeves movies represent comic Superman when that's not entirely true.,1
"What has he got, maybe ten minutes of screen time in JL? Of course it doesn't feel natural at all. He needs a solo film to really bring the change to bear. And to blot out the memory of that hideous mouth cgi.",2
If you mean the comics from the Golden Age then maybe yes.,1
If you‚Äôre talking like campy golden age Supes then yeah,1
"He liked Whedon's take on the character. Lighter, hopeful, positive. But acknowledges that the film didn't turn out well. Which is one of the things that came out of JL, for the most part everyone liked this Superman over what had come before.",3
"The sad thing about this was he didn't even do that. He said he agreed with *some* things (so, logically, must have disagreed in others) which in super nice, careful, Henry speak was almost like saying he hated his guts.",2
He was saving face people. Everyone was hyping theatrical JL when it came out.,2
Fucking get Snyder on it asap! Edit: so much for the Snydercut movement,0
"Would have been nice to have more build up.   They went 0-60 on that friendship even though at the end of BvS Supes was still 'Okay, weirdo, more important things to deal with so I'll work with you for now.'",3
I hated how Batman acted the majority of that film. He was a generic marvel character.. not batman. That moment was neat but it would have been nice to see a progression. Not him fumbling like an idiot. Batman doesn't do that.,1
"Between the behind the scenes BvS clips and the way they ""Yes, homo'd"" through the entire BvS press tour, I'd say there's a pretty clear indication that the rumors were a pack of lies.",3
"For the life of me, I can't think of what ""LBN"" is.",1
Mind boggling to me that people think this had a bigger effect on Affleck than his personal life falling apart and going to rehab. The changes to the movie were probably so small in his eyes compared to this,3
"Also Affleck was never to be an eternal Batman, after the JL movies and his he was done but then Snyder was booted so that didn't help.",1
Of course he would have been happy to stay it's what he signed up for man!,0
"If this level of commentary was coming from Ben, then how the hell do we know that what Henry is saying here isn't complete shit?",1
"According to the article: ""Cavill almost reprised his Superman role for a blip-sized cameo in this year‚Äôs Shazam! but says he couldn‚Äôt do it because of his Fallout schedule.""",3
">It was never a lie, the ones who thought it was are those who think pessimism is synonymous with intelligence.  To be fair it's also the industry standard response when someone doesn't want to do something like that",3
Aka Cynics,2
 ‚ÄúRide ain‚Äôt over yet‚Äù  *hangs up phone*  *you in tears*- ‚ÄúMy man‚Äù,3
"/Will Smith meme ""I aint even mad....""",2
"I bet he knows hes going to be recast but because the next superman is coming out so long from now he'll milk him ""still technically being superman"" for as long as possible - I dont blame him.",2
"Especially since all the comments are ""Henry Cavill"", which aren't wrong tbh.",2
I agree. A lot of people only focus on the mustache thing but other than that Superman in JL was classic Superman. He was my favorite thing in the movie. I can understand if people complain about the transition from BvS to JL being too drastic. But I don‚Äôt mind it.,2
"I used to like Synder's superman a lot before JL came out.. And Justice league wasn't all that great as we all know, but I felt like they finally got Superman right (mustache aside) The moments where he seemed genuinely happy and hopeful were superman to me.",2
"Another reason I can‚Äôt stand Snyder‚Äôs Superman is that Whedon knows how to use his powers. A Superman who can hold off several high powered heroes and still have the resources to kick into superspeed and lock eyes with Flash (all while still not fully powered up himself after being in a Kryptonian coma for close to a year, and then later single-handedly knock back an Apokoliptan) is *never* going to have a problem fighting multiple other Kryptonians with only ten minutes‚Äô worth of experience with yellow sun radiation compared to his lifetime on Earth.",1
Tru. But a man can dream haha,1
"The article of this post and Shazam‚Äôs director himself have already stated that Henry couldn‚Äôt be in Shazam due to scheduling conflicts between the time constraints for shooting scenes in the school and him doing Fallout.   Before this we didn‚Äôt know anything about his situation, and he didn‚Äôt not say anything about WB. How can you read all of this as ‚Äúnothing changed‚Äù is beyond me. Don‚Äôt be a grumpybear for the sake of being one, It‚Äôs not worth it.",1
GO,2
he had his name on those but they feel nothing like anything he made before.,1
"No, giving the wheel to Snyder what drove it into the ground.",0
Where did they say they have no future plans other than a ‚Äúsource‚Äù saying that?  And the only reason they didn‚Äôt get Cavill for a 5 second cameo and the end of Shazam was because he was on the other side of the planet filming The Witcher,1
"You know what. You guys are right. It‚Äôs zack Snyder‚Äôs fault.  He‚Äôs got the look, just wish they let him be better",1
Much better and Snyder didn't seem to really get Superman (imo of course),0
"Apples to oranges. Are you trying to insinuate that War Machine has the same pop culture merit as Batman? Are you comparing Terrence Howard playing a role once to Ben Affleck playing a role twice? Again, if WB felt like they were going to bring back Cavill they wouldn‚Äôt have filmed a headless Superman cameo for their new franchise. Spare me the scheduling conflict because if that was the case then the cameo would have been cut out.",1
Because WB doesn‚Äôt want Snyder‚Äôs story,3
"It‚Äôs too messy. The DCEU can keep what worked and phase what didn‚Äôt out of continuity. The next Superman story doesn‚Äôt have to be an origin, but even with Cavill you don‚Äôt have to keep everything that happened before as his history. It was made into too much of a mess by WB AND Snyder.   God I wish DC had just taken their time and done this universe right. I‚Äôve never had an entertainment experience like Endgame, and I know if DC had been smart and patient their eventual ‚ÄúEndgame‚Äù could‚Äôve been even better. Maybe one day...",3
"Because the DCU has been a catastrophe from a storytelling standpoint. They had the perfect opportunity to do more age-appropriate stuff without all the Marvel BS (low stakes, forced crappy humor, stories that don't go anywhere for 8 movies).      Instead they shit the bed with everything except Man of Steel and maybe Wonder Woman. The STORIES ARE THERE, can we just get a long-term plan and adapt them appropriately and take our time rather than rushing to a teamup to try to one-up Marvel?",2
"That's still a reboot, a soft reboot which is what I think they're probably trying to do with the universe.",2
"Just make it a standalone story for god sakes, and dont mention the fucking JL or Bats or any other DC character besides maybe Lobo. Hell's bells DC and WB are trifling.",1
Erase Zack Snyder? Why are they doing Aquaman 2 and did WW84?,3
"If things go the way I think they might, after Deadpool and Joker doing so well with heavy content, if a Snyder cut is released and does well, it might get the Bladerunner treatment and Snyder might be asked to finish his trilogy?  That would be nice.",0
Plus the divorce and alcoholism wasn't helping,1
"This could be what Henry is referring to in this article... ""You'll see""",3
"Yeah, Abrams can do for Superman what he did for *Star Trek* and *Star Wars*.  It won‚Äôt be the best movie ever made, but it‚Äôll be solid and on the right track.",3
"If it‚Äôs a standalone Superman movie with a new actor and no connection to the DCEU, then I won‚Äôt watch it. I‚Äôd consider it if it‚Äôs a one-off thing like Joker.",0
"I want Nicholas Cage!  God, can you imagine how weirdly entertaining it could be?",1
Pretty sure J.J. wasn't writing the ending for Lost. Alias would be a more appropriate comparison but it's ending was alright.,1
"It's been a while since I've seen it but here goes.   I hold this opinion because Superman isn't a punch first guy and an essential part of his character is that he can't save everyone but he wants to. The Superman in MOS didn't care about saving anyone. He was a reluctant hero but there wasn't anything on the other side of his reluctance.   I know it's not terribly well regarded but I enjoyed Superman Earth 2. It was all about this push/pull. They made a point to showing that he was so smart and gifted physically that he could have a career doing anything.  Those other careers could have given him money and allowed him to take care of his mother.   Yet he chose to two paths, being a journalist and being Superman that forces him to help people and not give him fame or riches. MOS Superman was kind of a loser/vagabond before he got into Supermanning.   Regarding helping people, Superman isn't a wanton destruction guy. The whole movie there is very little care for civilians or regular people.  I think an essential element of the Donner movie was get introduced to Superman just saving people, no villains at first but he's saving people. In the Donner film died of a heart attack and he couldn't help him but he's helping the people he can. In MOS he totally could have saved his father's life without people seeing and he just doesn't for no reason.  Also ditching his secret identity for a relationship with Lois from jump is kind of a buzz kill as him trying to determine which version of himself she likes is always an interesting dynamic.",1
"Bame Paramount and Reshoots. In the original/Snyder cut, he had his facial hair shaved. But when they had to do reshoots, Paramount wouldn't let him shave because his character in MI: Fallout had facial hair. They wouldn't let him shave then CGI the hair back on for the movie, so they had to settle for this.",2
"I kinda took this as admonishment of the Snyder Cut. Here he is saying darkness didn't work for JL, but the trash the studio put out wasn't that dark. Oh well. Maybe that is reading too much into it.",0
"That's the ""problem"" with The Dark Knight as well. Heath Ledger stole the spotlight at every one of his scenes to the point Christian Bale was overshadowed and his arc by the end felt like a subplot.",1
"No, I don't. Because that's what he's said in the past.   [https://squaremile.com/features/interview/henry-cavill-mission-impossible/](https://squaremile.com/features/interview/henry-cavill-mission-impossible/)   ""His debut, Man of Steel, remains the only ‚Äòpure‚Äô Superman film that Cavill has headlined ‚Äì with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League largely ensemble pieces more focused on setting up sequels than character or coherence... *While fiercely proud of Man Of Steel*, Cavill implies its story was intended to catalyse the more traditional, heroic version Superman for the direct sequels that remain unfilmed... ‚ÄòI'm ready to be Superman now and I'm ready to show the world the best examples‚Äô. That's where the joy and glee comes from, and that sense of warmth from the character, which is his real superpower ‚Äì he makes people believe in themselves. It was a shame because it would've been nice, and *it would have been a lovely coupling with the seriousness and the depth of Man of Steel.‚Äù*",3
> somber  I don' think you know what that word means.,1
"He's polite and careful with what he says. But saying something during the press tour is one thing. Saying he wouldn't change a thing about MoS 6 years later, feels like a stronger endorsement.   I doubt that even a majority of people were lauding the JL Superman. If anything, the most talked about Superman moment was when he looked at the Flash. What even is Whedon's take? The opening scene is pretty good, but completely overshadowed by CGI face. Even aside from Whedon doing him no favors with that face, lines like itchy and slowpoke aren't making people's top 10 Superman moments in the way that First Flight can.",1
"And he wasn't the only one. Batfleck said Whedon made Snyder's film ""better"" and that Whedon finished off his vision really well.   If he really thought that, I don't think he'd tweet ""ReleaseTheSnyderCut.""",1
Thats never going to happen,3
After what he did with BvS no thanks. I really liked where he was going with MoS and overall I loved it as a superman film and wouldn't change much save for a few tweaks here and there but BvS felt like a step backwards for me. Atleast for the character. I want a movie celebrating the character not a deconstruction.,3
"No thank you. I don't mind MoS, but I feel someone else could do a better job of understanding what the character means. Given their success together with MI: Fallout (which also caused a lot of the mess for Cavil in JL), I think Chris McQuarrie would be a great choice to continue Clark's story whilst bringing the character in a new direction. He's specifically said that he's interested in doing it, with Henry. They even pitched a MoS 2 idea to WB which was turned down.   In my crazy mind, I think WB is still bitter at Paramount/McQuarrie for getting them into the whole mustache fiasco in the first place and that's the reason it was turned down. Could also be that it wasn't a good idea.",3
"Yeah, I'm sure Snyder would jump right on the chance to do another superhero film.",1
"I imagine it may have been different in the original version. In a world where we don't have Superman feel itchy, he talks about the ring and likely addresses the end of BvS. Maybe Lois tells him that Bruce has built a super team to protect the world and he brought you back to life and he's sorry but won't admit it. I think it's at that moment, standing in his father's cornfield, that Clark realizes that Superman can work, he saved Bruce from evil, can cast off his doubts, and approach the world with a lighter attitude.  Then there's the final battle, where I believe the third bullet drop symbolizes Bruce on a suicide run, but seeing his new friends beside him, he realizes life is worth living. So instead of ""I don't not like you"" Bruce and Clark can have a more serious discussion about their relationship.",1
"I liked his mini ""Save one life"" speech to Flash. We need more of that Batman throughout the movie.",1
"I mean, how can you not love [this](http://media.comicbook.com/2016/04/henry-cavill-and-ben-affleck-177008.jpg)?",3
It's his literal job. Work place stress would have been just as time-consuming as his failed marriage.,2
It's also what he's publicly claimed,0
"Damn it, Fallout has had more success battling the JL than Lex Luthor.",3
"Both of you are right, stop being fucking stupid",0
Also true,1
Underrated comment lmao,3
Goddamn it this is fucking funny.,3
NUTS,1
"Lol, Sure...now we're going by ""feel""",0
"I don't know, Wonder Woman had a pretty Snyder ""feel"" to it.  I'm sort of doubting that WW1984 will feel that way, though.",0
"Bullshit, get off the Snyder hate train.",1
">""We actually don't have any current plans for Superman,"" Nelson said. ""We've obviously done a lot of great things behind the property in our history, and it's a key part of the family, but we don't have current plans behind Superman.""   - DC's head of entertainment.     As for Shazam, those small cameos were precisely how Marvel built a shared universe. You're telling me that they couldn't have found time in the two year production of the film for Henry Cavill to film one scene? Not likely.",1
"So what? They are carrying on with flash, WW and Aquaman.   Marvel didn‚Äôt reboot when they were done with Whedons corny one dimensional scripts and their ‚Äúbad guy is just evil version of good guy‚Äù origin stories.",3
When you say ‚Äúendgame‚Äù are you referring to the movie or to the culmination of a whole cinematic universe?,2
"Where is it messy?  What exactly is the problem going forward with either where we are now or after Snyder Cut?  At what point are the past movies canon on not canon, where do you start from?  They did it right as far as I'm concerned. MoS and BvS wipe the floor with every Marvel movie. Sure some of them do some great stuff Infinity War for example.",0
The day people understand that not all superhero movies have to be Marvel ( At leats 15 out of those 22 movies were unnecessary ) will be the day that the DC universe will really take off.,0
"I agree and would add that I don't think a new movie *should* be an origin. I'm kind of burned out on origin movies of heroes who have already had origin movies, and I think a lot of people feel that way, no matter how many retellings we get of Superman's backstory in the comics.  But on the other hand, tying the hypothetical new Cavill movie to JL and BvS is a mistake. WB needs to take a really hard left into new and unexplored territory. They can keep some of that stuff vaguely in the background, but bringing it up would be a mistake.",0
Yea WB fucked up.  They literally had the recipe in front of them from the MCU from the beginning.  Look at how they're handling now. Ironically similar to how the MCU launched with focus on individual movies and slowly weaving the mythos between them.,0
Even before JL they shit the bed  BVS tried to do way too much at once,0
That's also what WB have been doing and people hate it (Though i think it's the better option),1
"WW84 itself seems like a soft-reboot of Wonder Woman within the DCEU. Didn't Dianna ""retire"" for almost 100 years until the events of BvS? The movie would be contradictory to some of Dianna's story in DoJ & Justice League.   Not that it would be a bad thing.",2
"Nice dream, keep dreaming",2
And there will be lens flair,3
"You saw different Star Trek movies than I did, I guess.",1
Idk I can't forgive him for what he did to SW but at the same time there was probably a lot of corporate mingling over the creative parts.,0
"> Yeah, Abrams can do for Superman what he did for Star Trek and Star Wars.  Enrage and abandon the existing fanbase in order to bring in a new generation of fans? Yes, he does that quite well, and very consistently. I don't think he'd have a problem doing that for Superman also.",0
"> It won‚Äôt be the best movie ever made, but it‚Äôll be solid and on the right track.  Yeah at this point just making the movie a Superman 1 copy would be fine. Superman needs to come back to his former glory.",0
"Yeah i heard its apart of the same universe as reeves batman and they would try to implement the dceu actors into that as a soft reboot type thing i dont if its confirmed just something i read online, the article also said something about green lantern too",2
"Agreed. They can't recast Cavill if he still wants to come back. At least with the Reeves one, Affleck was annoyed enough not to return. If they voluntarily lose my fave onscreen Superman, I'm out.   Will wish viewers and WB the best of enjoyment and success (respectively) though, as I want superhero films to do well.",2
Nicholas Cage would be the perfect Bizzaro,1
I'm half expecting him to show up in Crisis.,1
"1. You seem to be locked onto the Donner version of the character.  While that's fine, you can't say that Snyder' version is ""not Superman"" or ""not who the character is"" because that's plain false.   2. In MoS, Clark saves lots of people, and if we're being technical, millions of people.  You are simply misinterpreting what Pa Kent told him: he knows Clark can't let people die, but it's still a risk because of the burden our world will thrust upon a child who isn't ready for it yet.  BvS proved him right.   3. Clark was far from a ""loser"" before putting on the suit in MoS.  Farming to help feed people is not a ""loser"" job, nor is working on a boat, or in a bar, or in the arctic.  I think it makes him working class.   4. The ""destruction"" in MoS is not promoted as ""cool"" to watch, it's the sad consequence of two aliens fighting in the skies above us.  MoS was one of the only comic book movies to show the result of superhero violence, something most CBM's avoid.  Just like there is a painful cost to a mother for giving birth, there is a consequence to the birth of Superman on Earth.    Overall, it seems you fall into the category of not accepting that Snyder's Superman is a legitimate version of the hero.  It may not be your ideal type, but it's perfectly accurate to the canon.  Just because you liked Earth 2 more than everything doesn't make those movies ""not accurate.""  So your comment about Snyder ""not getting"" Supes is therefore invalid and not worthy of consideration.  You're welcome.",1
"Why blame Paramount? It's not their fault WB decided to change most of his shots in JL.   They told Henry they wouldn't need him (per Charles Roven) so they shouldn't be surprised if things aren't prioritised for them. If they'd said they may need him, he'd probably just have chosen some five o'clock shadow.  Edit: mispelled Roven. :o",3
Don't blame Paramount at all. WB ordered the heavy reshoots and Paramount was well within its rights to maintain Henry's appearance for *Fallout.*,2
Well u can say that for every batman moviesüòÇüòÇ. Villain is hero,1
"I don't . I mean it's anecdotal, but that was one of the biggest positives from my group about JL.       You are bringing up moments, I'm talking about characterization. Yea, First Flight is terrific, but people cheered when he shows up and delivered the Justice line in JL (yea it's corny, but that OK from Superman).  Sure, the opening CG is terrible in JL , but the sentiment, the characterization is more of what the audience wanted.      This part is just me, but I want Snyder's visuals with Whedon's (or something like it) characterization. I honestly don't understand how to this day some fans just don't understand that for a VAST MAJORITY of the audience this characterization of Superman didn't land. I'm not saying, you shouldn't like it or that it was terrible. It just didn't connect with the audience in the way that I think Cavil wanted. That should be enough to change course.",1
Are those mutually exclusive options? I think someone can be okay with the theatrical cut and still want the director's cut too.,1
"The thing is the grass isn't always greener ,you got too far and we end up with superman returns where supes didn't throw a single punch and the only slightly decent scene was the aeroplane one.",2
"he understands the character better than most, 70th anniversary short proves as much",0
"That's hilarious, imagining that everyone behind is in character.",1
"If you think losing your marriage, children, and going to rehab are the same as work problems boy do I have news for you",3
We were agreeing with each other. Go away,2
Did you not watch the movies? Were they anything like BvS or MOS? Especially Aquaman,1
Nah you're right but Aquaman felt like marvel light,1
"I agree.   If they want to dump Cavill because they really want to separate themselves from Snyder, it doesn't make sense to keep Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller and Jason Momoa.  That's a direct contradiction of their own decision.   It makes even less sense since...  A) Cavill wants to keep going,  B) We (at least most of us) want him to keep going.  Cavill is great for the role; same for Momoa and Gadot. I haven't seen enough of Miller to feel strongly one way or the other about him.  Whatever Snyder's faults may have been, he made pretty solid casting decisions.",2
Not op but both. Endgame was the culmination of 10 years of 22 movies. And the first Avengers film was the culmination of 5 movies and the whole shared universe thing was ambitious. Justice league had like 2 movies prior to release and literally wanted to copy the idea of a shared universe because WBs execs were greedy.,3
"Look, I thought MoS was solid, and I actually really enjoyed BvS UE for what it was trying to be. But in terms of a connected universe they dropped the ball hard.  Now I‚Äôm down for an actual back and forth conversation so long as it‚Äôll be friendly and respectful. I love Superman dearly.  As for Superman, you can‚Äôt deconstruct a character before you put in the time to establish the character. I get what Snyder was trying to do with Superman, and the idea would be that at the end of the arc he‚Äôd be the Superman everyone loves. I think Cavill is an excellent choice for the character btw. But you have to give us Superman, THEN you can take a deeper look into his psyche. In say his 3rd film you could break him down and do some of the things Snyder wanted to do. But audiences have no reason to care about why Superman feels so conflicted about being Superman because we never saw him being Superman consistently or for long enough.  I feel like Cavill, mainly in BvS, just didn‚Äôt have a lot to say. Like he‚Äôd be silent so often when he was in the suit. Superman is confident, even if he‚Äôs unsure of himself deep down he‚Äôs not gonna mope all the time. He‚Äôs Superman! There can be moments where we see him reflecting about the weight on his heart, but for the most part he needs to carry himself like Superman.   Superman should inspire people, not make them feel gloomy. And once you‚Äôve got a few movies with him being that inspiring figure, then let us feel for him by pointing out his burdens. We‚Äôll be more deeply connected to him, thus we‚Äôll care about his hardships. You can‚Äôt start with sad Superman before you give us time to see him and care about him and just promise that the Superman you love will come later. That‚Äôs just backwards.",3
"WB isn‚Äôt going to go forward from after the Snyder Cut as apposed to Justice League. I  don‚Äôt see that happening.I would be interested to hear why you do though.   Honestly, starting a bit more anew could be healthy for the universe, it‚Äôs easier for creators to create something cool if they‚Äôre not caught up in the lore of a story that‚Äôs not only lukewarm in reception, but also left unfinished. Now we have lost Ben as Batman, and are unsure about Superman (Despite Cavils comments : yay!). I think it‚Äôs safe to say a lot is messy at the moment.  It‚Äôs simpler for you, as a big fan, to understand if a movie were to come out after B v S, if it were to start after a directors cut (that would change a lot) or knowing it connects to the past DC movies in some way, perhaps with some restrictions or changes to the cannon. But WB is looking at far larger audiences- and I can see why they‚Äôd be worried audiences would be confused about which stories there were, why there‚Äôs new faces in the main roles- I think it‚Äôs something WB would tread carefully with to try and make the most palatable decision. It‚Äôs easy for us to forget how confusing this all is from the outside looking in, since we are here talking on days like today, to best understand where we are at. Most people aren‚Äôt.  Justice League was also bad enough that it went and hurt other parts of the universe. For example, Batman V Superman wasn‚Äôt that well received. That‚Äôs just the case. But after Justice League I expect more people think they hate or hated BvS, I‚Äôm not saying any of this to personally put the idea down, but WB will certainly be thinking about all of these things and Batman v Superman doesn‚Äôt have a glowing reputation outside these subs. It‚Äôs been years now, would it be easier, in their mind, to pull out and dust off old stories and scripts, to open on scenes that are in one way or another tied into BvS or the far more hated Justice League? They‚Äôd be actively asking people to remember that failure, and also likely to rewatch it to get caught up.  My guess is WB desires a clean slate where they can hire some creatives with big chops to make something that works, even if it means putting a bit more of the past to bed and to start anew. Now- none of us can know what they‚Äôre thinking truly,  especially because it‚Äôs WB we‚Äôre talking about. But for the reasons stated above, and many others, I think it would be far easier for them to reset, or at least effectively restart.  Am I excited for this to happen? I‚Äôm truly supportive of whatever WB needs to do to make a compelling experience with some great storytelling. I‚Äôll get behind either if they think that‚Äôll give them the best chance to do this well and to do it right.",2
"BvS is worse than thor 2, and that's saying something.",0
"DC universe will take off when the execs GTFO the creation process and leave it to people who love DC, much like Marvel/Disney did with the MCU. Until that day, DC movies will continue to pale in comparison.",2
I could see a movie with Supes being a mentor to a younger Supergirl or something (Maybe even add Brainiac like Cavill wanted),1
We don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs the plot,1
Plus she gets the Invisible Jet,1
84 allegedly contradicts BVS so there's that,1
Heat vision is going to be blinding if JJ directs it.,3
"Nah, his wife called him out on it and he has toned it down ever since.",2
I don‚Äôt care if his heat vision has lens flares. Please give me Cavill as Superman!!!!! Please!!!!,1
What he did with SW was nothing compared to what Rian did though.,3
Then just watch Superman 1,2
"Bryan Singer already did that, though.",1
"I've been hearing this too - Battinson will be a different reboot and the actors that were successful in their roles, or who I guess haven't left, (Gadot, Momoa, maybe Robbie) would be recast or soft rebooted into this \*new\* connected universe (if the rumors turn out to be true I desperately hope that its the latter)",2
"Show me a Superman, outside of a miniseries, that would basically level a city without a care.   Superman was in hiding. He wasn't a happy guy in the boat. He looked miserable. He was hiding in those jobs. I'm older than the average redactor and have been reading Superman since the 1980s. Outside of a mini-series, show me a Superman who's this morose, this checked out. He doesn't exist, at least not for long because that's not Superman.    Snyder made one movie that I think worked to his strengths. Everything else has been disappointing with diminishing returns.  That said I think Warner gave him a raw deal and the movie we got with Justice League was probably much worse than what he would have created if left alone.  You are entitled to your opinion but I'm not wrong. It's my opinion and I think audience and box office supported my opinion.",0
"The reason they changed the shots is because they changed directors, both with different visions. It would have been even worse if they tried to keep the film exactly as it was planned.  &#x200B;  And Paramount refused to negotiate on it. They wouldn't let him shave. WB offered to do all the work to CGI it back on in Fallout, even pay for it, but they refused. Reshoots are inevitable in any movie, so even if Snyder didn't have to leave the movie, they would have had to reshoot scenes anyways. It wasn't WB's fault that his face was all fucked up.",0
I mean reshoots literally happen for all major movies. Regardless of reason. And iirc WB offered to pay Paramount for the CGI they would need to paint the mustache back in and they said no.,0
"WB offered to pay for and do the CGI to put it back on for Fallout, which would not have been hard at all, but Paramount refused. The reshoots happened because of Snyder leaving the project. Light reshoots would have happened anyways, as movies always reshoot scenes after all filming is done.",1
"lol I fully agree with you, but it's still so absolutely bonkers to me that a fuckin mustache won out   Like, in terms of which is easier to replicate, it's GCI costing ~$500,000 & 100s of manhours vs a fake mustache.",1
"Vast majority is a strong, non-quantifiable take. JL certainly didn't light up the box office. As Cavill says, it didn't work. We can discuss this all day, but it isn't a science. MoS killed the audience! BvS does well. BvS killed the audience! SS does well. SS killed the audience! WW does well. All I ask as a fan and for the fanbase is to be recognized as a viable opinion that matters. Analyzing that the general audience likes jokes and jokes will make a billion dollars is what has led WB to have this open wound in what they did to JL where their biggest stars Jason Momoa and Gal Gadot are telling people WB fucked up.   Cavill stands by MoS and that's good enough for me.",1
And then there‚Äôs too much on the opposite end where we see Superman as a Jesus allegory. I don‚Äôt see Snyder as the man to continue the franchise.,2
Absolutely fucking not.,1
"I didn't say they were the same, I said it would be just as time-consuming. Maybe even more. Regardless of what happens to his marriage and his vices, he still needs to pay bills, hence why he has continued to work.",0
"I won‚Äôt deny that, but honestly I think everything DCEU from 2017 forward has felt very early 2000s superhero movie in tone. It seems a little less ‚Äúwink wink‚Äù and a little more sincerely corny than even the Marvel movies.",1
HAHAHA wow the Snyder hate is strong.,0
Casting was great. Personally I even think Affleck was a great choice for Batman. They just didn‚Äôt give him a good script. That‚Äôs always the problem with Snyder‚Äôs movies to be honest. They are almost always Beautiful but empty. Gotta wonder if the guy should have been a DP instead of a Dir.,1
"Man of Steel  Batman v. Superman  Wonder Woman  Suicide Squad  Justice League  It‚Äôs like if Marvel tried to make Iron Man, skip to Civil War, skip back to Thor, do Guardians of the Galaxy, then try to make The Avengers but ended up with a less-polished draft of Age of Ultron instead.  EDIT: and in this scenario, somehow Thor is the only truly good one.",3
"Justice League actually had four  prior movies, BvS however came after just one movie and that was an issue.",1
"No problem. I can't make this too long because I need to get some things done.  Isn't a large part of that your expectations though, in what you think he should be?   What is wrong with starting with a character unsure of himself and then becoming the confident Superhero? I personally think it makes it better to start with a much more humble person and become confident and inspiring rather than simply being born that way.  He can inspire people after he has found himself and how he can fit into our world.",2
"Did you happen to miss where Superman died for a world that hated him, betrayed him, and completely turned their backs on him?  That to me, is incredibly inspirational.  Doing the right thing regardless of who approves or not, willing to die unaccredited.  Also, the message of ""if you seek his monument look around you"" was beautiful to me.  We don't need a Superman to save or destroy us, we can help each other, if only we cared enough.    Once the invulnerable God is put in the Earth like the rest of us, that ideal of Superman is heard.  He had to earn the admiration of the people.  So the problem isn't that Snyder missed Superman, it's that audiences have become used to Marvel's version of a ""superhero"" and reacted strongly to something that was being its own thing.    You follow?",1
"People have to think, what if this was your first ever exposure to Superman? I honestly don't recall one really inspiring line that would make me care about him, I care about him because of other properties. Even now I'm looking at BvS and Man of Steel quotes on Rotten Tomatoes and he just doesn't have anything meaningful to say.   Rather than the gloominess I think what's off putting is how directionless Superman is. The audience never gets much of a chance to celebrate Superman for what he is, a hero.   Look at the day of the dead scene where people are trying to touch him. The audience sees the people rooting for Superman as desperate, miserable and downtrodden people but you don't get the feeling he's giving them hope or inspiration, it looks like a cult.",0
"I would definitely love to see that, but any mental image I have of it winds up being really reliant on *Man of Steel*'s Krypton. You know, Kara frames Krypton in a way that makes Kal understand that the bad stuff isn't all there was, while simultaneously reminding her of Jor-El's criticisms and the parallels between Krypton and Earth. And like, that would be an amazing movie for *me*, but not necessarily for general audiences?",1
84 also allegedly is a disaster and turning out to be awful just like the first WW movie *allegedly* was.  So I don't care about anything ALLEGEDLY being reported before a movie comes out.,1
HE'LL LASER EVERY FUCKING ONE OF YOU.,3
"I'm not even sure what he did *wrong* to SW in the first place. I thought TFA was really solid even if it was just ANH ""remade""  As for Star Trek however that's easily his masterpiece when it comes to rebooting a franchise. That movie is almost a 10/10 in my opinion.",3
You're right I guess. I associated TLJ to TFA. I didn't like TFA but didn't hate it at least.,1
"Not really, I'm simply watching the movies as they've been presented to me.  You don't need to read Ayn Rand, Socrates, or watch YouTube video essays on the films to come to this conclusion.    Simply open your eyes, unplug your ears, pay attention, tune in to your surroundings, and you'll learn a lot more than by reading stupid ""memes"" or clickbait on the internet.",1
"Again they didn't have to change so much, or they could have done a better job on the mustache removal, or they could have dumped the pointless opening which was the worst part of the CGI, and either way it's frankly not Paramount's problem.  This isn't Cavill's first big budget rodeo. He's fully aware there are usually reshoots, and given his love of Superman why would he grow a mustache for a movie which shoots the entire time any reshoots could possibly happen?   Unless he'd already been told that he wasn't needed, and basically had the okay to do it.  WB should have had a bit more forethought, before they pushed Snyder out, to make sure all the actors would be properly available.",1
"As is their right. Again, not their problem.  Edit: incidentally although they did offer to CG the tache back, MI checked and decided it would be too difficult to make it look good/realistic. Which is a fair choice.",2
They didn't feel it would look right. CGI isn't perfect,1
"I mean, Superman at his core is the paragon of humanity. He *is* hope. That‚Äôs not too far off from a savior figure like Jesus.",1
absolutely does,0
I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't care at all about justice league. He looked terrible for the reshoots and before you say it was because Snyder left he was gonna look that way in Snyder's reshoots too. Some things are more important than work,3
"Again, nothing for me to disagree with there.  Ben Affleck was a really interesting choice and I think he worked well with what we've seen of him as a veteran Batman and Bruce Wayne.   I'd really like to see a solo movie with Affleck as Batman, but that's not going to happen.",1
Age of Ultron ws always unpolished,2
"Agreed, although Suicide Squad actually came before Wonder Woman.  Which makes the order look even messier.",1
"You don‚Äôt have to do things the one way! Just because marvel does it this way, doesn‚Äôt mean it must be done this way for everything. Christ.",1
"And that‚Äôs an interesting take! Even Cavill admitted that,  but he also admitted that that take didn‚Äôt resonate with enough viewers. Now they need to take a step back and think, ‚Äúokay, that was a good try, but it didn‚Äôt work out in the end. What can we do now that‚Äôll be more successful.‚Äù  Cavill imo has a great perspective on his time in the DCEU, admitting as to what worked and what didn‚Äôt.",2
"I could see that showing up   You could add to it with Brainiac having his DCAU origin, this being an AI from Krypton that predicted the planet's end",1
84's reception seems to be mixed,1
GODDAMMIT,3
">As for Star Trek however that's easily his masterpiece when it comes to rebooting a franchise. That movie is almost a 10/10 in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong I absolutely love his Star Trek, but I gotta disagree and go with Mission Impossible as his ""masterpiece"" of rebooting a franchise.  It's very close, but he brought that franchise back from the dead after MI2 to being a billion dollar franchise.  Star Trek he kind of just changed it to be more mainstream and kind of avoided their dreaded odd number movie curse.",2
"I absolutely love his first Star Trek movie, it's crazy good.",2
"That‚Äôs pretty much exactly where I‚Äôm at in relation on what he did for SW.  As for Trek, never cared for it before but he managed to make it interesting to me.",0
Sure but you can't blame WB either. They did what they could in the situation.,1
Also would make for a good story when the people see him beaten.,1
"I think there's making him the symbol of hope that he is, and turning him almost completely into Jesus Christ himself. I don't mean to act as though religious symbolism is bad. But it can be obnoxious/annoying when beaten over the head with it.",1
"Yes, it's entirely possible he had no problems at all during the reshoots, but I don't pretend to know how Ben Affleck feels because I'm not Ben Affleck. I'm just pointing out how a stressful work environment is nothing to just dismiss, especially in the case of someone going through divorce and alcoholism. Yes work may not be as important as some things (who knows, maybe Affleck values his work more than his marriage), but that doesn't make it any less of a daily obstacle. There isn't anything to argue here, it's just clarification.",0
That's precious coming from someone who's only commenting because they are seething mad about some fucking movies,0
"Of course not! It just felt very rushed, and due to Marvel, I was accustomed to getting used to characters before having them beat each other up.",1
"No, you don‚Äôt.  But the choices aren‚Äôt between following the Marvel formula or making a gigantic mess of the whole thing, are they?",1
"I think for a Kara movie I prefer Brainiac to be this unstoppable force they didn't know anything about, that just showed up, left a crater where their capital city used to be, and left the entire planet's sense of security irreparably shattered. It gives a more personal touch for Kara specifically to be scared as heck of Brainiac, which can't happen if he's an apparently friendly AI until the very last second.",1
"I'm not blaming WB, but I don't see why it's *always* Paramount's fault. It's not.   Contract for JL finished, contract for MI started. Reshoots have to fit around the current contract, that's how it's always been. If WB can't get what they want then plenty of movies have had to delay release to accommodate actor availability. Entirely WB's choice.",1
Fair point (So Brainiac wiped out Kandor and then bugged out or manipulated Krypton's end?)  It's sad how this reminds me how much I wish Krypton was canon and still running.,1
It didn't though. There's a reason actors are required to come back for reshoots. It's not another production it's the same one and is part of the process.   Reshoots are not an extra thing.,0
"I never really liked the idea of anyone being responsible for Krypton's destruction, save maybe for generations of Kryptonian leadership doing the wrong thing. Sort of a good on-the-nose allegory, don't you think?",1
"They are. Not all movies budget for them. Fox apparently didn't schedule reshoots for their movies, probably to try to keep the on paper budget down. Disney builds that into the budget and shooting schedule.",1
"Reshoots *are* an extra thing in Hollywood as far as the timing, funding and contracts - extra X per day *if* needed for reshoots - is concerned. *Especially if you tell your actor you don't need him.*   You definitely don't get to choose to do it when *you* want if he's working elsewhere. Otherwise actors and productions would be spending half their lives waiting for his/her previous production to finally officially finish which would mean Hollywood would grind to a halt.  Imagine if it was the reverse and MI needed him back, with a mustache, and now JL has to shut down for a minimum of a month to grow back the tache, plus however long the reshoots take. It would be madness.   Reshoots happen, but always fit around the actor's current production.   Edit: In some cases actors get recast if they aren't available for reshoots and their entire role reshot with someone else. Obviously if it's a main character then the movie gets delayed.",1
Oh true but my suggestion was more that it left before Krypton died and began upgrading itself,1
"Reshoots yes are usually given a window of time where they say this is when they will be. And JL particularly went over that time. To the tune of 25mill+ over. But that's not to say the idea of reshoots wasn't talked about. It's a known thing.     Their reshoots were having problems from the start. It caused issues with Ezra for fantastic beasts and Henry. But also MI6 being delayed due to Tom breaking his ankle was also a spoke in the wheel of issues. So how to you really plan around that.      Hell Macquarrie was willing to let him shave it, but Paramount stood their ground. So it was just a dick measuring contest with Paramount waving their power for no real purpose other than to stick it to them.     In very rare cases does a actor get recast, let alone a lead one. I'm not saying fully blame paramount, but yeah that was kind of petty of them to do what they did.",0
"Regardless of when the reshoots were planned - and they literally could have only happened when MI was shooting - *WB told Henry they didn't need him!*  Don't do that if you have the mildest inkling that you intend to push Snyder out and bring Henry back. It's very simple; 'Hey Henry, we might need you, so don't do anything too drastic looks wise. Thanks.'  Paramount is allowed to be as petty as they like (and, you know, they weren't) as he was under contract with them. MI is one of their few successful franchises, so there's no way in hell they'll do anything but minimise their risk as much as possible.",1
"I mean, I just searched it, I cannot for the life of me find a source that said they didn't need him explicitly. Just a lot of ""Henry was under the impression he was done with is role"" that means a whole lot of things.",1
"Well being 'done with his role' means finished, there wasn't plans to be called back. Henry personally wouldn't have been 'under the impression'. He's not an idiot who's never done a blockbuster. He knows one way or the other.  WB are not going to straight out say, 'Yo, we fucked up', especially as they were spinning the 'it's only a little bit of reshoots and Paramount are being mean' story.",1
WB is making the wrong Superman spinoff show. Tyler Hoechlin‚Äé's Superman isn't nearly what Routh's was and still can be.,3
And Routh looks dope af.,3
Makes me wonder if Conroy is the Burton/Shumacher Bruce.,3
Where‚Äôs Dean Cain at?,3
"Awww that‚Äôs so cool. I was really hoping for this, glad it‚Äôs happening.",2
That's kinda cool,1
This news to people or do people just forget from when super returns came out,1
u/PeterP211   Thoughts?,0
"Good, because apparently TV is the only way to get a Superman that stays true to the core tenets of WHO Superman is. I'm sure Snyder would have gotten us there had WB and DC not interjected with Justice League. I like MOS, was kinda lukewarm with BVS, and outright thought the JL we got was terrible (due to the reshoots). However, I grew up with Reeve, and I grew up reading the John Byrne headed Man of Steel comic, and my favorite show growing up was Lois and Clark, and then Smallville. All of which GOT the core of Superman. It's just a shame the DCEU never got to that point. Here's hoping the TV exploits coming up in the near future really spur on the studio to do something with the character.",0
These guys seriously need to move on from those movies. They are over 40 years old at this point,0
"A Routh Superman series? Fuck yeah, I'd be down for that.",3
Routh Superman rumored for HBO Max,1
Thank you! CW Superman sucks,1
"That would be mindblowing, but I doubt it. It's whatever version of Batman would have been from the Christopher Reeve movies, since they are both the Kingdom Come versions of themselves.",3
"Well, he looked like he was wearing braces, so he could possibly be Kingdom Come Batman.... Or even The Animated Series or Arkham Batman since he voiced them both.",1
Conroy seems to be Kingdom Come  If you look at the leaked image he seems to hae the exosuit type thing he had in that comic thanks to his age  Also it's fitting that Conroy (who some think is the definite Batman)  and Reeves Superman (Who some think is the archetypal Superman) come from the same Earth,1
"Theres a newspaper in Crisis showing Keaton as Bruce, saying he's getting married to Selina Kyle.  Which I believe confirms Burton's isnt related to Schumachers.",1
"He committed wrongthink, so he's been banned.",2
"The CW wouldn‚Äôt dare pay someone of the opposite political view.   Such an inclusive and warm network, aren‚Äôt they?",1
Blacklisted for being too conservative by Hollywood standards.,0
"The ‚Äúcore‚Äù of the character has never always been one thing only, it changed overtime just like the character. Frankly its pretty silly how some versions supposedly ‚Äúget the core right‚Äù over another solely cuz you like em more.",2
"Yeah don‚Äôt think Snyder was the man for the job in regards to Superman, his plan was to kill Lois off and the. Have a mind controlled Superman slave to Darkseid. Thankfully WB came to their senses.",0
I generally agree though in this case we‚Äôre talking about a seasonal CW crossover gimmick where the whole *point* is to reference previous continuities and franchises.,3
"No, they don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre fans and viewers enjoying their output doesn‚Äôt impact you.",3
"So you just hate everything DC don't you? You hate the Snyder movies, you hate the old movies, you hate the middle movies. You're just here to hate everything.",3
What difference does it make to you what people enjoy?,3
"So what if they're over 40 years old? Superman '78 defined Superhero movies and is still looked back to for inspiration, and they had the opportunity to use that Superman for their crossover, you'd be stupid not to use it",3
They never will. Which is why a modern day Superman movie will never be successful,0
"Very much an unpopular opinion, but Routh was my favorite Superman.",3
"Wait, what?? Where did you hear that?",1
"In Burton's Superman Lives film he wanted Keaton to speak at Superman's funeral, and Kilmer/Clooney both talk about Superman.  The fan canon was always that Reeves Superman and Burton/Schumacher Batman were in the same universe.  *Iffffff* specifically Keaton is to separated from Kilmer/Clooney, then it's possible that Conroy would be portraying at least ONE of the two options (Keaton or Kilmer/Clooney).",1
Doubt it. He's probably Batman of the Birds of Prey timeline since they never really showed him on that show back in the day. I doubt they'd retcon the Donnerverse by saying Batman existed this whole time!,1
Well that means he's either the Burton/Shumacher or he's Adam West's cuz Reeve's Superman came out between both.,0
"People are downvoting you but not trying to prove you wrong, because they can‚Äôt.   I don‚Äôt know about Hollywood as a whole because I‚Äôm sure he still gets work, but it‚Äôs very clear the CW is discriminating because of this. No reason he shouldn‚Äôt be in the crossover.   If it comes out that they approached him or if he‚Äôs even in it as a surprise I‚Äôll gladly be wrong. Hate to see any major network be so close-minded.  Edit: And these same people literally downvoted you for thanking me for backing you up. The pettiness is unreal here. God forbid you say something someone doesn‚Äôt like.",1
"The core of the character is hope, that didn't changed until the New52. I like what Snyder was aiming for, and did you miss the part where I said I like MOS? I really like the end of BVS too, because that showed us the hope he's supposed to inspire. My opinion isn't clouded by what came before, I have watched every version of Superman and Superboy except for the musical, read an astounding amount of the comics. I love what Shuster and Siegel created, I love what they intended him to be, a symbol of hope that can overcome any obstacle.  I'm not sure why what I said is getting downvoted, especially with my own admittance that Snyder was going there and was stopped by studio meddling, and that I liked MOS and BVS. Hell, I even want to see the Snyder Cut released!",1
I mean modern Superman is very different than Reeves and there‚Äôs room for both.,3
"Yeah, why can't Superman just snap necks and be perpetually sad and angry?",2
I really liked him. I didn‚Äôt like Returns that much but I was really looking forward to seeing him in the sequel.,2
"Before Cavill I had an even more unpopular opinion, Dean Cain was the best Superman.",1
"It's a rumor that has popped up on Reddit here and there. Plus, Routh is leaving Legends of Tomorrow. Not hard to do the math. Something is probably in the works.",0
They were not connected.,2
He's probably Batman of the Birds of Prey timeline since they never really showed him on that show back in the day. I doubt they'd retcon the Donnerverse by saying Batman existed this whole time!,1
"Well, apologies for misunderstanding. I suppose maybe you expressed yourself in a way some disliked, hence the downvotes.   However I disagree that Superman‚Äôs ‚Äúcore‚Äù has *always* been about ‚Äúhope‚Äù, not necessarilyz",1
"i think the OP is saying that ""modern"" superman in the comics is irrelevant but most people just want to do what Donner did",1
"Yeah, I want my Superman throwing bad guys seemingly to their deaths while smiling during his struggles!",2
He's never been perpetually sad and angry. I don't know what movies youve seen,0
"I'm a fan of Returns, so a sequel would have been awesome, especially since Singer said that Brainiac was supposed to be the villain in that one. Oh, well.   I don't watch any CW shows, so in case I want to tune in on the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover will it be terribly confusing? I just want to see Routh with the cape again.",2
Harvey Dent's line from TDk about either dying a hero or living long enough to become the villain fits Dean pretty well these days.,1
Kinda silly to say since Crisis could make them connected,0
"Nah man i'd rather pay $20+ to see some cornball saving cats out of trees and spewing cheesy dialogue about ""The American Way"" in 2019.",0
"There should be enough outside fan service to make up for anything confusing.   Freaking Kevin Conroy too, man. It‚Äôs nuts.",1
"This is the second time I've seen this mentioned only in this thread, I haven't heard anything before now. What the hell happened? Did it turn out Dean is a sexual assaulter?",1
"That sounds like a Superman movie. Nothing is too big or too small for Superman. From stopping Brainiac from capturing a city, to helping a lost child at a mall or, as you said, getting a cat from a tree. I'd like to watch or read Superman save a cat from a tree and most people would.  &#x200B;  As for the American Way part. what comics, and I know this an absurd idea because you don't read comics, have you read these days where Superman rejects Truth, Justice, and the American Way? The closest is when he threw away his citizenship, but they ignore that and today very fucking day, Supes fight to American ideals.  I would recommend you read What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and the American Way or Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow, both of which were written for people such as yourself. And if you want an angry, self loathing, sad, violent Superman, there are hundreds of incredibly repetitive Superman analogue comics that cover that such as Invincible, Sentry, and  Irredeemable to name a few. Fuck, Invincible gets a TV show next year, so you don't even have to read the books.",2
"Well! You're in luck sir! Here is Justice League! You will get plenty of cheesy dialogue, a happy Superman who wanted to stay dead and lifts up a whole building without it falling to pieces!   (Just to clarify, I don't hate Reeves Superman, and my previous comment is just to show that you can take anything out of context and make it look bad. I just find it ludicrous that we're moaning about a Superman struggling to find his place in a modern world and would rather see him smile in his situation. I'm not a long time reader of Superman but from the recent stuff I've read he's still nothing like what all these people are hammering on about. I think he's changed, like almost every superhero since the 70's but for some reason they won't allow Superman to change with them, it's fine if you have an idea version of Superman, it just doesn't make any other version wrong by default. I personally think we were gonna get a modern Superman in JL based on the 2 scenes that were cut. I appreciate MOS and BVS a lot for the darker (with glimmers of hope throughout) approach, but hopefully one day if we get the cut and another solo movie we can see a fully accepted Superman who fully embraces his role as a hero. That's my take on it anyway)",0
"I mean, I know the comics, so it shouldn't be too bad, right?",1
"I like that first paragraph and totally agree, reminds me of that scene from ASM2 where he helps fixes that kids Science project. Had a huge smile on my face when that scene came on.",1
"Wtf is ""The American Way"" mate? Saying shit like that with all seriousness in 2019 just sounds corny as fuck. Even Captain AMERICA doesn't talk like that in the marvel movies.   >And if you want an angry, self loathing, sad, violent Superman   Yes because me saying I dont want to see corny, roll my eyes to the back of my head shit in superhero movies in this day and age when they are of such high quality equals to me saying all of that. The recent Superman movies, The Death of Superman and Reign of the Supermen dont have any of that corny 1970's crap in them and they were sick as fuck in my opinion. The marvel movies aren't corny but they are still funny and lighthearted enough.    Making superman a cornball is just not it for me, I'm sorry. Captain America is a similar character to superman in a lot of ways and hes a straight fucking badass in most of the marvel movies, theres no excuse.",1
"Yup, they haven‚Äôt taken crazy liberties with anything important and they‚Äôve said they want to respect the source hard on this event.   Perfect to just kick back and enjoy the library of DC they‚Äôre going to pull from.",1
"That was a great scene but the big difference is it wasn't corny/eye rolling/lame and it was actually pretty funny and wholesome with the little conversation spidey and the kid were having as he walked him out of the alley.   Superman saving cats out of trees and talking like he just came from the 60's is not funny or wholesome, its corny.",0
Awesome! Thanks for the info.,1
Hes certainly talented. Definitely. Loved him in Rock and Rolla.,3
I think he‚Äôs a good actor so definitely!,2
"With Lightray, you need a guy who can act very cheerful, a literally ray of sunshine that bounced off of Orion‚Äôs more grounded and dour outlook on life. I can kind of see Kebbell doing this but honestly, I can see him working better as Orion",2
I want him in some form in the DCU.,1
I thought he was going to be Scarecrow in The Batman.  No?  Pretty sure that has been heavily rumored.,1
Under rated movie.,2
"He stars in my favorite Black Mirror episode, most of which relies on his fantastic performance.  He was a good choice for Doctor Doom but was entire squandered in Trank‚Äôs Fant4stic.",1
Agreed. Kebbell has a gloom quality in him while Lightray is total joy. And you kinda made me wanna see him as Orion now.,1
A real rock n rolla wants the fuckin lot,1
Haven‚Äôt watched that movie. Probably won‚Äôt. I need to to watch Black Mirror though.,1
"Season 1, episode 3.",1
The BvS released in theaters is more Batman than Superman. The Ultimate Cut is pretty even. And its supposed to be. The name is Batman-v-Superman after all. BvS was supposed to be about Superman answering for the destruction of MoS and then redemption via his sacrifice at the end. The movie is dark in tone. By the end of JL we were supposed to get the proper Boy Scout Hopeful Superman we all know and love via his resurrection. And we did kinda. He just had a fucked up lip.  We still need a proper MoS 2. WE NEED A PROPER MOS2. CAVILL DESERVES A PROPER MOS 2. WARNER PLEASE STOP BEING DIPSHITS!!!  Its sad when WBs most talked about movie right now is one we may not even get. That says a lot about WB and DC in general.,3
Depends on which version. The Theatrical Cut is a mediocre Batman movie with Superman in it. The UE is a great Superman movie with Batman in it. Superman is literally the core of the plot of the movie and is the catalyst for everything. I think Henry was just trying to get people to shut up about how Dark the movie was.,3
"It‚Äôs most definitely a Superman film. The whole film is the world‚Äôs various reaction to the Superman. ‚ÄúMust there be a Superman?‚Äù   And Batman is just another person who‚Äôs reaction we get to see, and because of what he perceives Superman as and what Superman is doing, is why he decides to do something.   But the whole movie is understanding how people see Superman, and as a result, how Superman sees himself. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt owe this world a thing, Clark.‚Äù   The movie is part of the his arc in becoming the Boy Scout Superman we all know, but that can‚Äôt happen until he finds his place in this world and understand how others see him. This arc was supposed to end in Justice League, leading up to that scene in the end where he finally accepts himself and we see him do the classic ripping his shirt open scene.   Even the main plot is focused on Lex Luthor‚Äôs reaction to the Superman. He plans everything just to spread negativity and hatred towards him and plans to set everyone against him including Batman.",3
personally i think of it more as a batman film. it starts off with bruce‚Äôs point of view and from what i remember he had a lot of screen time compared to supes. the directors cut seemed to include supes more tho,2
"In my opinion there's a clear bias towards Batman. It's built as a Superman sequel yet Batman name's comes first in the title. They promoted a fight but in reality is more of a hunt for Superman where we see Batman the supposedly underdog ""hero"" prepare for a fight he shouldn't win. Surprise, surprise he wins and gives him a speech about how much better he is. Batman's my favorite character but I hated how Superman was treated in that movie. Still the story revolves around Superman and he's the hero that sacrifices himself to save the day.",3
It‚Äôs a Superman centric film but follows Batman more,2
Its both but I thnk Batman had more focus and screentime,2
"It‚Äôs balanced when you watch the UE, although the R rating is definitely that way because of Batman and Bats alone.   Also why I wouldn‚Äôt mind R rated Batman films going forward, but it‚Äôll never happen.",2
"Well, ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù is the first person mentioned in the title, so he has a point.",1
"It kinda depends. I mean yes, we are introduced to Batman in the movie, a lot of it also goes around how he reacts to the presence of Superman and the destruction Lex wrecks in Superman's name. By contrast Superman is more of an object that moves through the movie that everyone reacts to. It's only really near end Superman really starts to do things. But at the same time, Clark is sort of more in the movie, he is out doing things as himself and it's only near the end the two become one.",1
"As Cavill said, BvS is a Batman movie.",1
Henry Cavill thinks it‚Äôs a Batman film.,2
"Theatrical cut is a Batman film  Ultimate Edition is a Superman film  The entire Snyderverse films - MoS, BvS, SS, WW and JL is centered around superman.   MoS -  An alien living among us  BvS -  People reacting to his actions ( both +ve and -ve )  How doing good is viewed politically by a faction of people. People mistaking superman as a jesus figure.  (Powerful people like Lex and Bat feeling threatened by it) How his sacrifice brings good in Batman and WW.  SS - Govt. realizing that superman sacrificed himself to  save the world.  They're afraid if next superman might be evil and arranges a deadly task force to do the dirty job.   WW - The true nature of humanity in peril.  Diana realizing how all hope is lost in the world.  Decides to remain hidden till Superman comes back and changes her view on world.   JL -  World with no superman and no hope.  Heroes gathering to stop a common enemy.  Eventually realizes that the world needs superman and the HOPE that comes with him.  Rebirth of Superman.  He can either move on or join the fight.  Superman embraces the shining ray of light.. the hope that must dawn upon the world in the tough time.   HOPE is what DCEU's Superman brings Its not sudden.. But it arrives.",2
"I still always see it as a Superman film. The entire plot is a conflict between Superman struggling to be a symbol of hope for the world while Lex is trying to tear down that symbol of hope and power either literally or metaphorically. Batman is just a character that gets caught in the middle and manipulated to Lex's ends. But it's still a classic Superman vs. Lex story, just set in a larger DC universe with other DC characters",1
"The story is about superman with a strong focus on Batman's perception of Supes since BvS is about humanity reacting to/judging  Superman and Batman is apart of humanity. Superman is the main hero and the film can't happen in any capacity without him. A film about hope and people uniting in the face of hatred. Inspiring change in the most hardened heart and trying to remain steadfast in your ideology is as Superman as it gets. It being ""dark"" means next to nothing since  there are plenty of ""dark"" superman stories. Darker than BvS which isn't that dark just serious and sombre at times.",1
"Aside from the ending battle, Batman had all the major action set pieces in the film. And even for the ending, many thought Wonder Woman stole the show. I‚Äôll agree.",1
"Folks would rule against it being a bats movie cause bats never had a complete plan and killed, so, if batman doesn't say ""it was all as i planned"" at the end then its not batman, snyder would never give the fans that moment. Supes was legit in my mind. I still give it a 9/10",1
"You can argue both its an ensemble movie afterall. The movie has to establish batman since it's his first appearance so naturally there will be more batman, however the core idea that drives the plot is focused on superman.",1
"When I saw it in theaters I think said it was split down the middle , but the Ultimate Edition most definitely makes it a Superman movie with Batman",1
"On paper I would say it‚Äôs balanced. It serves as a direct continuation to ‚ÄòMan of Steel‚Äô with the events of that movie serving as an important plot point for Superman himself. At the same time it serves as an introduction to this new version of Batman and him dealing with the events of ‚ÄòMan of Steel‚Äô. But when watching the actual film, this includes the ‚ÄúUltimate Edition as well, I feel as if the movie leans more towards Batman. The tone, cinematography, and the best action scenes all scream Batman. Superman feels inserted in a world that feels more catered to Batman.",1
Balanced.. has potential to be seen as 2 different movies if seen from Batman's perspective once and supes' at another viewing.,1
It's a great superman story smothered by a pretty one note batman movie. (Even the UE is unbalanced),1
It's more of a Batman film in the Theatrical definitely   Ultimate is debatable but I'd still say it feels more Batman then Superman,1
"UE definitely makes it feel like a Superman film, but overall it certainly has a more narrative focus on Batman‚Äôs reaction to Superman.   The problem with the film is that we really don‚Äôt get Superman response to the events transpiring. He doesn‚Äôt get a chance to really speak his mind or convey his point of view.   Obviously, this was done deliberately to instigate conflict between Batman and Superman. So as a result, the conflict feels very one sided. So it‚Äôs more like Batman and the World Vs Superman.",1
"Theatrical - Batman movie ft. Superman  Ultimate Cut - Superman/Batman  Besides that, BvS in my opinion is more of a Superman story, explored through Batman‚Äôs perspective as he goes through a transformative character arc. Superman is the character propagating the story while the story is about him as well, explored from outside perspectives.",1
"I think it‚Äôs a Superman movie told from Batman‚Äôs perspective until the climax. In a lot of ways, Batman is the antagonist for most of the film, but the framing paints Superman in his paranoid point of view.",1
"Ummm I suppose a little more batman.  Story wise it's a little more Superman, tonally it's far more Batman, but what makes it lean towards it being more of a Batman film is....well.....is because they don't give Clark many lines.  we understand where Batman is coming from and his motivations are externalize, but we don't get too much of that from Clark, and I get he's a more introspective character here still figuring  out his place and actions, but despite being a big BvS fan I still do feel that Clark needed more to say.",1
To me BvS is a MOS sequel in Batman POV. Or a MOS 1.5 sequel.,1
"It's both, reason being is it's certainly a sequel or atleast a continuation of MoS. But half of it is told from the perspective of Batman. It's neither more so of someone's film or not. Yet the story does follow on from MoS with Superman having the core elements to the narrative progression. i.e. Lex and Doomsday, which batman has none of other than Superman himself.  Edit: I suspect Cavill is less in favour of it now since being brainwashed by Whedon and Johns.",1
"I‚Äôd say the ultimate edition balances it,and the person who decided to cut out important story points should be fired",3
Yessssir,2
"Preach, brotha!",2
"It‚Äôs really more Superman.  From Batman‚Äôs POV, he represents the people that get hurt on the side.. the pain and anger that brews from collateral damage.   Lex represents effectively the haters and alien-phobic.  The media represented the philosophical question of who should be making the choice of who to save? America? Superman? The government? I love that piece about: ‚Äúhow do we tell a mother whose child could‚Äôve been saved by Superman‚Äù (forgot exact quote)   The senate scenes represented the political POV of the consequences of taking action in our world dynamics. You can‚Äôt just intervene across borders as there can be consequences.   The shots of people being saved being thankful and in the end mourning, represents the people that have a lot of love and hope and are welcoming of him.  Lois represented the relationship struggles that heroes (like police officers of firemen) go through that isn‚Äôt really talked about much.   The scene with Jonathan when Clark questioned everything after the senate bombing, explains that all your choices have consequences. We can always try to do the right thing, but sometimes it ends up hurting people. But it‚Äôs still the right thing to do.   Martha understands the weight of responsibility that has been put to Clark because he has powers. Just like the age old ‚Äúwith great power comes from great responsibility‚Äù but to be honest she‚Äôs right: he doesn‚Äôt owe the world a thing. Very similar to Jonathan‚Äôs assessment, he has to make that choice for himself.  And finally, this is really Clark‚Äôs journey. MOS he understands where he comes from and accepts his powers. BVS he goes around being the hero his father wanted him to be. But as we all expected not everyone will be happy he‚Äôs doing what he‚Äôs doing. You do your job as a hero, but people still will hate you. Of course it‚Äôs human to question if it‚Äôs worth it all along. And that‚Äôs what I loved about Zacks vision. It‚Äôs a very human journey to find your path of who you want to be. And I think that to be a hero, you have to carry that burden and accept that burden.",1
Batman wasn't the hero in the film. He is a secondary antagonist after Luthor. Look at how he is introduced he victimizes his prey and the people he is meant to be saving are scared of him. He isn't the hero and wasn't meant to be perceived as such in this film.,2
lol that‚Äôs the whole point of this post.  to discuss on what we think about that statement,1
lmao that‚Äôs why i posted this,2
>I suspect Cavill is less in favour of it now since being brainwashed by Whedon and Johns.  Haha good joke...it's a joke right ?,1
"I'll say that it's a movie about Batman dealing with Superman.  The gab between their agency is even bigger on the theatrical cut, but part remains on the directors cut.",1
"It think that you nailed to aspects, I believe the next dc black entry should be horror and yes they have to cast an absolute star as the lead.",2
All for this. The hitman comics and swamp thing which featured him were really good. Always wondred what the justice League dark film would have been like after seeing the concept art of the baron mordo actor attached to the role.,1
Love the idea.,1
"Counterpoint:  >""I've always enjoyed the traditional, very classic view on Superman in the comic books,"" Cavill says. I think there's an enormous complexity to that character. I know when I was working with Joss, he and I saw eye-to-eye on some of the aspects of Superman. That paragon of hope. That ideal. That wonderful feeling of, 'Oh, good Superman's here.' I have also developed a very personal and protective relationship over this character, and it was just lovely to have the opportunity to smile and feel good.""  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-superman-justice-league-henry-cavill-20171119-story.html%3f_amp=true",3
"I don‚Äôt know what to believe anymore. He has done some very different comments in the past few years. But, well, he‚Äôs a big Superman fan and I hope he comes back. Being a fan of Zack isn‚Äôt something we need to care about. All that matters now is for him to find a way back to wear the cape again.",3
"It's traditionally expected for actors not to criticize their own work, isn't it? If that's the case, then Henry is in kind of an awkward spot when it comes to how to adapt Superman, regardless of which side he might actually fall on about how the DCEU has been up until now. Given how different Justice League is from BvS, he'd have quite a line to walk.",2
"To the reasonable-minded, it's rather clear what Snyder was going for with Henry's Superman arc: he wanted Supes to have a reason to do what he does.  Why does he feel the need to help people wherever he goes?  His goodness doesn't just happen in a vacuum, there must be a reason for it.  A ""why"" as Snyder says.    BvS unraveled Batman and Superman to see what it would take for them to break their moral codes.  For Clark, when the whole world has betrayed him, all it takes is Lois to make him see Superman as worth it.  Just like Martha helped Jonathan feel that doing good is worth its cost.  Clark accepts that nobody will approve of Superman yet still returns, faces Lex, kills Doomsday, dying for an Earth that hated him.    Even then, in JL he would be reassured of Superman as he watches the League unite in his honor.  That's what the scene of him flying above Earth in space was all about.    And yet... Snyder's Superman is ""not accurate,"" ""depressing,"" and ""not heroic?""    Child please.",3
This was proven in those few seconds we got of him talking to Alfred in that deleted scene.,1
"In my personal opinion I think his agent is a hot mess, she is fairly new to the game and has been providing him with mix signals. My guess is somewhere between the mix reactions to MOS and BVS she probably wanted to distance him from Snyder in hopes of A getting a better deal for them and B Be provided with a better director and story so he can become more marketable. She probably thinks the whole universe started with Superman and in a matter of 3 or 4 films including SS we are introduced to 15 plus characters which takes the direction off of her client. It was more or likely her that stood ground on the Shazam cameo if I was Cavill I would‚Äôve distanced myself away from her ex wife of the Rock or not she is way in over her head playing hardball with studios and making him look unapproachable as a result",2
"He‚Äôll need a new director though,",1
I believe in Cavills Superman not zacks,2
Indeed. Snyder‚Äôs Superman was gonna evolve into the confident n happy Superman everyone wants the character to be.  Then Lipzarro happened.,2
Wasn't that a spoiler back in 2016?,1
This guy gets it!,0
"""The reshoots were minimal."" -Ray Fisher   ""We were fortunate that when Zack was not able to continue we got a guy who is very accomplished in his own right. [Whedon] he sprinkled some of his fairy dust on our movie and finished it. I dont think theres any way to go back and say 'oh that's a Joss scene, that's a Zack scene'. They were working together toward a common goal."" -Ben Affleck   It's all bullshit PR.",3
Ben Affleck also said joss was the best choice to take over and tweeted #ReleaseTheSnyderCut 2 days ago.,2
"Yeah, and Ray said the reshoots were minimal and David said Theatrical SS was his cut.  PR man. It's all PR. Until these past few weeks Jason was the only one ballsy enough to publicly criticize WB and praise Zack.",2
I'm a firm believer everything said since Zack stepped away is just Henry playing ball with the studio for his future in the role. Understandably so. Ben shows support even though people were somehow convinced he left because he didn't like this Batman. He left because of the shitshow behind the scenes and studio politics.,3
"Original plan of JL movies was to have him join Darkseid after Lois gets killed but y'all still believe the ""he was gonna be optimistic and hopeful!"" lies. I guess that's heroic for some of you?   Child please.  We were never supposed to get a true Superman because the director either straight up dislikes it or doesn't understand it. It was always gonna be depressed Mopeman",2
"I'm saving this comment to show it to any hater of my homie g ZS and the real dawg Henry ""Daddy"" Cavill",1
This article proves my point.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/screenrant.com/justice-league-henry-cavill-snyder-cut-support/amp/,1
Apparently he had a pitch that the Producer or Director for his Mission Impossible film really liked,1
"And Cavill believes in Zack. So by the transitive property, you believe in Zack.",1
Cavill's Superman IS Zack's.,0
"Aka literally what happened with Post-Crisis Supes. Bryne MoS series wrote him more conflicted (In fact a little more depressing than Snyder's MoS), and it was only after Death of Superman that they got Silver Age optimism back.  Plus, it could be worse. It could be Bronze Age mopey Supes. The closest thing to that in movies was the Singer incident of 2006.",2
It pisses me off so many people deny this was the plan and think Superman was gonna be a brutal Injustice type the entire time.,2
This wasnt released until the behind the scenes stuff on bluray.,2
"If Henry Cavill was so on board with Snyder's vision, why hasn't he come out in support of the Snyder Cut? Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot both posted about it, yet he didn't.",3
It's that and the actors don't know what was cut.,1
I mean If I'm honest Whedon Supes did feel more like a fully formed Supes,1
"I love how we say ""it's all PR"" when we really mean that they all straight up lied to the fans.",1
I feel it was also his personal issues but yeah that had a role,1
"I mean I can see the intent but the arc is still pretty muddled.  Superman doesn't feel he's developed much from MOS to BVS despite the fact they do seem to lean in a more hopeful direction in the ending scenes (Cavill has said this himself)   Then he has a crisis of self doubt thanks to Luthor before dying. Allegedly he had some scars from coming back mentally (Not sure how much this is true tho)  Then he turns evil thanks to Darkseid, killing Aquaman and WW while also bringing the Knightmare timeline to fruition.   This presumably is maintained in the JL 3 film to some extent.  So my question is, at what point in this arc were we getting the true, optimistic Superman? At best we'd see him be optimistic in JL 1 before turning evil in the next movie with no spinoff actually following up on this",1
with the way snyder fanboys post here i can‚Äôt even be sure if this is a sarcastic post,1

"Nah. Snyder directed him like a brick. Those moments of levity, that smirk, those looks of earnest Joy are sprinkled in those are all Cavills,'s charm and charisma oozing through. Same with JL Superman when not stupid lipped",1
I too enjoy making bold proclamations without any evidence of their accuracy.,2
"He was gonna go through the brutal Injustice thing in the future, then Flash was gonna fix it with time travel and he'd have ended up happy, confident and inspiring. And I couldn't wait to see both of those things.  Bloody complainers. Art has very rarely improved by listening to people whining on social media.",1
Probably the same people who thought Superman was emotionless/cold/inhuman/selfish/arrogant/broody/gritty/edgy...,1
"Because he is playing hard ball with the studio to get another movie made. He is still playing the ""Justice League is a funny accident haha"" card.",3
Well he came out about Mustachegate. Close enough for someone who seems to avoid talking about JL at all.,2
"But we know Zacks was also going to get there in the same movie. And it wouldnt have had ""I believe in truth, but I'm also a big fan of justice."" Which had beyond abso-fuckin-lutely nothing to do with what Steppenwolf just said. As it stands Joss's reshoots just sacrificed way too much for me to enjoy. Everything involving the codex and darkseid had to written out, which  was apparently quite a lot.",1
Exactly what you said. On one hand we know for a fact that it was supposed to be a tight 5 movie arc and not go on like mcu. On top of it we know what the basic story of those movies was gonna be.  There's literally no place I see him being HIM in Zack's DCEU (as long as he was in charge at least).,1
"What makes you say that? How do you know?   I've seen plenty of Zack directing people and he's very detail orientated. I haven't seen anything at all to backup what you're saying, have you?",1
"What ACTUALLY was funny was when Johns, Berg and Whedon all got kicked out the club as their reward. üëçüèª",2
"Not liking the theatrical cut does not mean that he likes the Snyder Cut. It also does not mean he is against Joss Whedon's vision of Superman, or that he is for Zack Snyder's vision of Superman. It just means he didn't like the final, compromised version, which is neither fully Snyder nor Whedon.",3
Steppenwolf literally just mentioned they were too weak to see the truth.  I'm also unsure of how much Superman would approach his OG counterpart for reasons I've mentioned somewhere else in the comments,1
"I'm glad Whedon didn't get to make a Batgirl movie.  The ""thirsty"" bit and the boob falls wouldn't have been the half of it.   Even if he was working to a studio mandate to make the film short, light, and not leading to a canceled sequel, there was no excuse for some of the shit he put in.",3
If that's not telling of their mistakes I dont know what is.,1
"The thing with Snyder's vision, is it was always meant to end up more optimistic. Just like Post-Crisis Supes, he had to die to truly become that type of Superman. The difference is under Snyder it would've been a more serious optimism like Donner's movies. Under Whedon we got dumb Lester and Quest for Peace level material.  You can't base anything off of Cavill's statements near the TC. Everyone was hyping the TC (Except Jason, he always was more put-off by it) for a while. Even Ray who was basically cut out of the movie.  I'm just saying, Cavill always seemed more comfortable playing Supes under Snyder compared to the wooden acting he gave in the Whedon cut.",2
"Just because he also mentioned the truth doesn't make his reply coherent. Hell, we don't even know what the fuck Steppenwolf was actually referring to because there was no context",1
"He did the EXACT same ""falling on a woman and saying sorry"" bit on Age of Ultron and it wasn't funny then.",3
"The whole Donner/Lester and Snyder/Whedon is actually a really apt comparison.   Can't believe it's been sitting in front of me this whole time and I never really saw it, despite being familiar with the Donner Cut.",1
Didn't Supes turn evil in the JL Sequel? Which would have probably been maintained in the next film,1
Steppenwolf was referring to power being the only law with nothing else mattering.   It's still hackneyed but he was replying that he believes in truth as well as justice (Basically a one liner but him also saying fuck Steppenwolf's whack line),1
"The difference being Lester at least tried to make Supes II a functioning movie. The Donner Cut is 10x better, but Lester tried. Whedon didn't (Or he didn't get a chance to, depending on how you look at it).",2
"In the original JL plan (Which was abandoned early on and even Snyder says it was too crazy), JL2 would've ended with Darkseid killing Lois and subjecting Supes to the Anti-Life Equation. Supes would've been held under that for a small part of JL3 most likely.",1
They were both awful. Lol,1
Oh I know,1
Man of Steel is genuinely great. I understand some BvS criticism but MoS? No way.,3
MOS is what finally made me love Superman after a lifetime disliking the character. It has a special place in my heart,3
MOS is genius. My favorite super hero film. I will continue to defend this film until the day Cavil is caught on video kicking a puppy.,3
Among the early dc successes MOS is absolutely there. It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs better than a few Marvel movies,3
MOS is perfection. I always wanted the rumored prequel that was based on Krypton.,3
Sooo I've always being a fan of Goku and DB in general (always a fan) and it really pissed me off that people said Superman was better than Goku.   After watching MoS for someone that knew the core of Superman it changed my perspective of him. Not only showed me that he can struggle but also showed me the HUMAN SIDE of Superman.   For someone that always liked Batman (thanks to Nolan) MoS is a fucking masterpiece.,2
"Mostly agreed except for Ant-Man 1. 2 is correct though.  Cavill AND Superman deserve one great movie. The comic book movie that doesn‚Äôt come very often. They deserve the Dark Knight/Logan/Spider-Man 2 treatment, where they give them something special and maybe even academy award worthy. Cavill is the dude to carry it.",1
"I'd have had Dylan Sprayberry in the scene where Jonathan died. I'd leave the rest alone, but that's the one thing I'd change.",1
"This is really nice to hear. Personally, I might have done a few things a little differently, but Man of Steel is probably still my favorite superhero movie. Or if it isn't, it's very close up there.",1
"Going forward though, what should happen ?",1
Agreed. As a starting point there are some tweaks I would make but MoS is pretty fucking good. BvS ruined everything for me.,0
"I saw BvS before, which was basically what roped me into the world of superheroes, and I thought Superman was cool, but when I saw MoS I had a new love for Superman. He‚Äôs not just a goody OP superhero. He has his own struggles too, like any of us.   Not to mention, the score was amazing. It makes me feel like I can fly.",3
There‚Äôs only two movies where I feel like I‚Äôve watched a different movie than everyone else. Man of Steel is one of them. I think that movie is fantastic from start to finish.  With the exception of Pa Kent‚Äôs death I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything subpar in that movie.   I do understand some of the BvS stuff though.,3
Agreed it is my favourite DCEU film.,3
"80% of MoS criticism: ""Not muh Superman"".  15% of MoS criticism: ""Boring cause no smiles""  5% of MoS criticism: ""Dammit, I've already spent enough money at IHOP this week and now I want it again"".",3
"Perfect superman origin story, in my opinion",3
"Most of the criticism about Man of Steel is based on what's not in the film, so most of these criticisms are worthless imo.",3
"Really my main MoS criticism is the hack-y dialogue throughout and some non-sensical plot points. Could've been a great overall, but for me that stuff really holds it back. BvS has way better dialogue imo",1
But but he wasn't a confident Superman. He still had doubts and wasn't sure about his place in the world. That's not my Superman!,0
MoS was good but the pacing was a bit slow and the biblical imagery was a tad too heavy. Other than that it was a good Superman origin.,1
"It's because at the end, Superman isn't saving non-existent people falling from buildings.   Avengers has a scene where Captain America orders some cops around, which is apparently enough to escape the criticism that none of the Avengers are actually rescuing people in the climax.",1
"Zod is an awful villain, i do not think you can make a good Superman story without using Luthor as a main character. I struggle to find a good Superman comic that doesn't feature Luthor.  Also Luthor needs to be smart and have a smart plan.  The movie was dead on arrival just because of Zod.",0
"People don't give it enough credit. It's better than Iron Man 2 & 3, Thor 1 & 2, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man 1 & 2, Captain Marvel.",2
I‚Äôm a big fan of the BVS directors cut,3
"The only thing I hold against it is the exposition is a little heavy. We see/are told about the destruction of Krypton three times. The scientist needing to give the textbook definition of ‚Äúterraforming‚Äù to a high ranking member in the army. Other than stuff like that, it was great.",0
"Daaaaaaaaa da da daaaaaaaa, da da da daaaaaaaaaaa da da da da da daaaaaaaaaaa da da daaaaaaaaa da daaaaaaaaaaa da da da da da",3
"Yeah Pa Kent's death kind of annoyed me. I can kind of understand it, but it should have been done differently.",3
"I just don‚Äôt like how he dies because of a dog. A dog that is different in the flashbacks and present day because the dog has died and been replaced. The dog would be dead anyway, but Clark‚Äôs father and Martha‚Äôs wife could‚Äôve still been with them all these years  Anyway, I fucking LOVE Man of Steel. It‚Äôs overwhelmingly heroic, inspiring, and triumphant, while also epic and badass (something that I‚Äôd never considered Superman to be before). Johnathan‚Äôs death isn‚Äôt that big of a deal. And with most movies I love, the more time goes by, the less I care about the flaws and the more I just love the good parts",2
What's the other movie?,1
"Much as I like Red Letter Media, whenever Zack Snyder gets brought up I wonder if they actually pay any amount of attention to his stuff. Their vitriol for Man of Steel is some of the most shallow bullshit they've ever spewed.  If anything deserves to get hit with an ""Ok Boomer"" it's whenever Mike, Jay, and Rich go on a tangent about Snyder (Yes Jay, Zack just wanted to make The Boys. Just ignore the themes of the DCEU are different than what The Boys is about and saying, you need to lay off the skull vodka)  In fairness though Mike pretty much made the Sequel Era of Star Wars. So he's being punished in some regard for his insolence /s",3
"I actually made a image, made of little images, that are almost every shot of Superman smiling on MoS, BvS, and the Snyder shots of JL (what was left of them anyway).    What is funny is that i actually had to left some out because i had too many.",2
">That's not my Superman!  Well, he is for alot of people.   When in his origins does he actually know his place??. He's constantly being challenged and for once you actually see him struggle, yet he still overcomes. Why do you want to see mindless entertainment?. Superman deserves better. He's not a marvel hero that's just a two-dimensional character.",3
"People who are born confident are quite often arseholes. I'd prefer him to be humble and grow into confidence. What's wrong with giving him an actual reason be ""your"" Superman.",1
"Nah Michael Shannon killed it as Zod. It was a good foil to Superman (someone part of his past with his abilities on the other side) and ultimately, he chooses Earth over his parents‚Äô world. Honestly that kind of reminds me of assimilation of culture and living in the US since my parents were both refugees",2
"Well Zod is a hell of a lot better villain than Vanko and Killian.  They did Mickey Rourke dirty by cutting out the scenes he wanted to humanize and develop Vanko, and Killian is basically a copy paste of Syndrome from the Incredibles.",2
"I don't know if I'd agree with everything on your list.   But then I think its kinda rediculous to even consider them in the same sentence. I mean, the only similarity between all those films and MoS is that they're all comic book films.",0
Saw it. Fixed a lot of the film structurally but the premise and choices of the film are still meh for me.,0
I get you. The Krypton stuff while cool did seem a tad drAgged on,0
Hans Zimmer really outdid himself,2
"It‚Äôs not a huge deal for me but I do like the heart attack angle more personally. Rather than ‚Äúthe world isn‚Äôt ready,‚Äù it‚Äôs a ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt save everybody‚Äù lesson.",3
"Well said. I also fucking LOVE M.o.S. I never understood all the hate, it is one of the best comic book movies ever made. I called in sick to work to see it so it wouldn't be spoiled and I will never forget how I felt after I saw it. Was so amped up, the opener on Krypton was amazing. There's one shot where the camera surveys the land as Jor-el is, seeing all the destruction,  and it just looked like a comic book splash page come to life. So much greatness in that movie.  Even the Pa Kent death, as stupid and needless as the circumstances were, it still pulls at my heart every time.",2
"Completely agree, his death was the worst part in a movie that I otherwise completely love.",2
"I love The Last Jedi, I‚Äôve heard all the complaints, I just don‚Äôt see them.",0
"Clark smiles throughout all the movies. He's just not playing Clark like Reeves did as a sort of goofball.  A thing people seem to miss in BvS, is when he's carrying the Mexican girl to her mother in the crowd, he has this great Superman smile on his face as he is reuniting this family.",3
"It's so weird. Everyone talks about how they want the campy Superman from the comics and old movies, and I sort of scratch my head. I think people's nostalgia makes all that seem more childish and campy than it actually was, because the Donner movie is NOT campy. The ""truth, justice"" line is literally taken as a mocking joke (It was post-Vietnam after all). The first actual scene of the movie is everyone on a dull empty planet dying. Hell, 90% of the MCU has way more jokes than Donner's Superman, which is actually pretty restrained and serious. Especially compared to the George Reeves show. Granted, that's just Supes 1, but I don't think anyone wants something like III, IV, or the Lester cut of II (Or they didn't until the Lester Cut got weirdly popular a few years back. Which I still do not understand).  As for the comics, Golden Age Supes killed a bunch of his enemies and wasn't afraid to get violent. Post-Crisis Supes was conflicted and didn't even want to save people until he was forced to and only became more hopeful after resurrection. Bronze Age Supes is just completely depressing. New 52 Supes... sucks. Meaning the only ""campy"" Supes is Silver Age Supes. Aka the shortest era of the character. And the one that was only that way because of the CCA neutering everything.  The only explanation: they don't care about the comics, they let their childhood view of the old movies shape their current view of them, and they base their interpretation of Superman basically entirely on the DCAU version. Aka the version literally written for kids. And unlike DCAU Batman, Supes was more censored by that fact (I guess because they wanted him to be more of a role model).  &#x200B;  But the guy above was also being sarcastic so this doesn't really matter.",2
I agree completely. For some reason I still enjoy it but admit it has flaws!,0
Agreed. BvS is a rare case of a movie overwhelmed by its own potential. JL is underwhelming in its intent and purpose. MOS didn‚Äôt fall off the rails.,0
"I enjoy it, I even love Eisenberg as Luther, but Batman killing people without hesitation takes a lot of the uniqueness from him for me. He‚Äôs pretty much the punisher in that movie.   Ben Affleck killed it but I think writing/directing decisions stopped him from being the definitive version.",0
"Exactly this. I really enjoy the movie but Pa Kent's death is just so stupid to me. I hate it more than ""Martha"".",0
I agree so much,2
"I actually have a lot of complaints, but overall I love that movie too. And every time I rewatch it, the stuff I consider bad just fades more to the background for me, and I just focus on how much I love all the good stuff that‚Äôs in that movie. I‚Äôm a big sequel trilogy fan and a fan of all the characters and actors, designs, cinematography, etc. of the sequels. I don‚Äôt let some complaints take away my love for those movies. I‚Äôm so hyped for The Rise of Skywalker",1
You're unironically getting downvoted for liking a somewhat divisive film - ya think these fuckin idiots have any shred of self awareness? Ridiculous.  Also I'm with ya - TLJ was class.,0
"The thing is, Reeve also wasn't much of a goof in the first movie. His Clark Kent was a bit nerdy, but that's what Clark Kent was at that point. He didn't get his Pulitzer-winning, stud reporter make-over until Bryne got control of the comic. It was only in Lester's scenes that Reeve got very similar to, well, ReeveS (George). But even then, it never seemed like Reeve really liked playing him so unseriously. George at least managed to add some humor by kinda being a very cocky Clark. Christopher was always more in his element as an optimistic but serious Superman.  I love that BvS scene btw. Mainly because you see him smiling, until people are reaching out to him like he's a God. Because he doesn't want to be a God. And that's something a lot of Snyder haters seem to forget, Clark never wanted to be a God. But for whatever reason, the fanboys do want him to be an all-knowing hopeful God, and not just a person trying to help. That's the whole point of Superman, he's the most human of all of us.",2
"This exactly. I grew up actually *READING* superman comics in the mid to late 90's and had a real obsession going for the character at one point. Know what I thought of Mos? I fucking LOVE it, because;  1: the casting is beyond perfect, and not just Supes. *all* the characters were cast that well. And yes, even Mr white. The actor's skin color was obviously not comic accurite, but the man plays that character's modern interpritation better than anyone else could ever hope to. But that aside, everyone looks and acts their part perfectly.  2: the plot had actual stakes and pitted Superman against enemies who could have actually taken him out without the ""I win"" button (Kryptonite). The emotional and sentimental ties in the plot were also handled very well IMO.   And I personally love that version of Zodd, because he's a villain through and through, but he has understandable motivation and moral grey areas instead of just being generically evil.  3: Lois Lane is a character who's always seemed to work like this; we're *told* she's smart and independant, yet she's too stupid to tell Clark and Superman are the same person and she needs saving constantly because she's too careless or pig headed. The Mos Lois is actualky *shown* to be smart and independant, only needing saving occasionally (rather than constantly) and usually only when dealing with a superman level problem. And even then, sje holds her own a lot of times. She even figures out who the mystery super human is all on her own, by doing her god damned job. I like this Lois a LOT. The classic idea of her was just annoying and IMO insulting to women.  4: we see that superhuman battles can and will actually cause damage. I mean, even in the comics, Metropolis should have been literally leveled at least 20 times in the past 30 years or so. Yet the next issue is ""everything's spotless again, 2 days later"". Not here though. Superman can only do so much to contaon Zodd, and their battle (his first super human level battle) actually causes a lot of damage. Much more believable and much easier to get caught up in the momment. IMO anyway  5: the score is fucking perfect. And I don't feel like I need to further elaborate on that point.  6: my favorite thing in the whole movie is Clark's character arc. It's not just him being Jesus like everyone likes to pretend. He has a moral fiber to him and is believably developed through the movie. And in the end, he's faced with ending the life of a mass murderer to save a family, and does the *only* thing this character could have ever done. And then we see his agony at having no choice but to do it immediately after. We also see his actual vulnerability right after that, when Lois has to be there for him in his grief. It's perfect. And I seriousky don't care what any poser, MCU swilling idiot thinks about that   For my liking, Mos is one of the best modern super hero movies. Right up there with The Dark Knight and Days of future past. But we don't get 40 quips every 16 seconds, cardboard cutout baddies and meme actors. So people have to invent things to hate about it.",3
The context wasn't exactly obvious... *Sigh* touch√© though.,1
"It is definitely really rewatchable, but there are also many writing and storytelling problems.",1
I‚Äôm a huge Sequel Trilogy fan and The Last Jedi most of all. Even the stuff I don‚Äôt outright love in that movie I still like. It and Man of Steel or the only two movies where I‚Äôve left the movie absolutely adoring it and coming online to see outright vitriol.   I‚Äôm so incredibly excited for The Rise of Skywalker and I hope everybody likes it this time around so I don‚Äôt feel so crazy.,0
"It‚Äôs so strange, I like BvS but had I said that I think it‚Äôs unabashedly a masterpiece I don‚Äôt think this sub would‚Äôve bat an eye but I say I like The Last Jedi and feel like I saw a different movie than everyone else and suddenly I‚Äôm stupid.   I don‚Äôt really care what other think of the movie as long as I like it but damn, you‚Äôd think this sub would know that liking a movie others don‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt make you wrong.",2
"It's the one two punch of the people reaching out to him like God and looking back seeing the building collapse from the fire.  That's Snyder's throughline in the movie. Everyone thinks he's either a god or a devil, but he's just a guy that wants to do the right thing. Snyder's take is probably the most human version of the character.",2
"1. THIS. Agree on Perry as well, Fishburne is perfect as him. It helps that he seems to really enjoy the role as well. 2. Totally agree. It was nice seeing a Superman movie where Clark is actually pushed beyond his limits. My entire love for the neck snap is that:    1. It shows Zod is suicidal at that point. He's tragic in that it's literally in his DNA to defend Krypton. With no Krypton to defend, he wants an honorable death.    2. Zod is stronger than Clark. In the end, Clark has to submit. Zod wins in the end, which ensures that Superman must train and become better. Not just to defend the world, but to make sure he never crosses that line again. 3. THIS. Kidder had a lot of good stuff in concept, but they never really gave her the chance to shine. Durance was great on her own, but the writers were really schizophrenic with how they wanted to write her in context of the show. Adams was the first actress that avoided the usual Lois traps. She wasn't a nutjob like they played Kidder as, nor was she just a damsel like Durance ended up being half the time. She was, well, a journalist. It was believable to me that this woman was a Pulitzer-winner. 4. Agree, and I'd specifically like to talk about how the Battle of Metropolis FEELS real. New York gets destroyed in The Avengers, but it's so obviously fake that it doesn't have any weight. The VFX in MoS are so convincing and have so much force to them that I think the GA got a bit shell-shocked with it. 5. Yes. 6. It still boggles my mind that people were okay with Clark throwing powerless Zod to his death in II with triumphant music in the background, but Clark being forced to kill a stronger Zod and feeling remorse is ""a betrayal of the character"". Same people that were okay with Keaton enjoying blowing people up and lost their minds at Ben killing to save Martha I guess.  Literally everything you said is 100% correct.",2
"I loved Last Jedi too, and I'm honestly too concerned that Rise of Skywalker will walk back some of the things I like about Last Jedi to be truly hyped? But don't get me wrong, I'm still excited, just in that ""oh god I hope this is good"" kind of way.",1
"I think that Rise of Skywalker has so many ‚Äúingredients‚Äù that I already love, that it‚Äôll be very hard for me to dislike it. Even if I don‚Äôt love the plot or it‚Äôs not what I thought I wanted at first. To be honest, I don‚Äôt like a lot of important plot and character endings in Avengers: Endgame, but it‚Äôs executed so well that I‚Äôm able to accept it and genuinely love that movie. It gives me such joy watching it. I truly trust that The Rise of Skywalker will fill me with joy and excitement. No one will get the exact movie or ending that they want. But I‚Äôm prepared for that",1
I wasn't a fan of BvS but I'm no downvoting people for liking it - especially cuz I understand with all the venom around TLJ. Bit much to expect self awareness from nerds I s'pose.,1
"I‚Äôm happy to see others that appreciate and ‚Äúget‚Äù that‚Äôs sequence. It pains that epic almost, painterly like art piece. It very much reminds me of he shot Watchmen, which is my fave Snyder and my fave CBM, probably even over The Dark Knight.",1
Thanks. It's awesome to learn that other people enjoyed this movie as much as I did.,2
"It's without a doubt the best Superman movie. And I say that as someone with intense nostalgia for Superman 1 (To the point where I used to say I HATED Superman II for ruining Reeve's character. I still don't like Lester Supes II, but I got over the pure hatred I had for it). To me Snyder did for 2013 exactly what Donner did for '78, give me a Superman in a realistic world that I could believe was there. Reeve made me believe a man could fly. Cavill made me believe a man could *soar*.",2
"Yes.  My love of this version of the character is that he's super*man*. Meaning he has the personality, life, upbringing, struggles and moral compas of a human being. He just happens to posess the powers of a god. And that's how the character is conveyed.  We see him struggle with things. we see him try and figure out his place as a man *and* as superman, we see him as a 3 dimensional character. Not a 1 dimensioal nostalgic cutout.  I honestly feel like a lot of people's real issue with Mos is that ot's not the Marvel formula. And TBH, that's a huge part of why I loved it.  I personally loved the Reeves superman a lot as a kid too. But it's been SO damn long since I saw that now. I'm gonna have to rewatch that and the director's cut of Superman II as well.",2
Excited for Pattinson but will always be sad at the potential of what could have been.,3
https://images.app.goo.gl/rvTC6f3x8y9GVns16  I know it's from The Town but I dont know where anyone made up the bullshit about CG abs. Because its Ben Affleck? The dude can get in shape. He literally only needed to be in his best shape for this very day of shooting. Otherwise they just maintain.,2
"I used to be morbidly obese, now I‚Äôm at my goal weight. When I first started working out, my playlist included BVS soundtrack lol, and like the Bane related themes from the Nolan movie. Quitting didn‚Äôt even cross my mind while listening to these tunes, they‚Äôre insane.",2
CGI abs? :D Nah. I always was more motivated by Cavill.,0
Batfleck was ripped,3
This is becoming a meme at this point lol it‚Äôs said in almost every single thread in this sub,1
"Agreed, there's a lot of potential in those CGI abs Ben had. I hope VFX Artists can do as good of a job to Pattinson.  /s",1
The BVS soundtrack is fantastic. It took me years to fully appreciate it.,2
"Yeah definitely. Cavill has it as an everyday life. Ben was very thick and did it for the purpose of the looks of the suit and his Bruce but, he was definitely not close to ripped as any other actor. In fact I think Bale was far more ripped in The Dark Knight. He was just shorter.  I‚Äôm not sure about the cgi though. I mean everyone that loses lot of weight like Ben did , has abs if he also does training.",2
honestly maybe. ben was super thick so having abs would be very difficult,1
RIP ripped Batfleck,2
Right where he belongs!,3
Would of loved a movie with this whole cast,3
Awesome!! In the next 5 years this is going to be a lot different and I‚Äôm excited for that too.,3
Margot up there with the trinity,1
Soon they will replace Leto with Joaquin,3
Remove Jared Leto's joker and I am ready to use this as a banner!,2
half these peopleare 'still' here,1
This is what it looked like previously: [https://i.redd.it/t78ehc01kek21.png](https://i.redd.it/t78ehc01kek21.png),1
I always love those ITunes banner remind me of the hall H ones.,1
"Ray, Ezra, Henry, Ben, Jared, and Will will be absent from the banner in like a year‚Äôs time.",1
"That's awesome, good for him. Still no Green Lantern though üòí",1
Perspective. How does it work?,1
Wow!! Drax is here too...,1
They changed it and kept that abomination in? Wow,0
I don‚Äôt see the Wizard anywhere?  But it‚Äôs cool they added Captain Sparklefingers!,3
Heck yeah!,2
We would have gotten an epic justice league 3 if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact we got part 2 and 1 taken from us.,3
would've,1
and Smith with Elba and Affleck with Pattinson,0
Should be replaced with Joaquin. Don't care if he's not in the DCEU.,1
Ezra aint being recasted,3
"Henry‚Äôs not done tho, he just said",3
"Idk about Henry, I think they‚Äôll still want Supes up there. Batman‚Äôs staying until after The Batman comes out on digital. judging by when Shazam was added.  Don‚Äôt see any reason to remove Ezra.",2
Unless a new Superman comes then I don‚Äôt see Henry absent from there. And I think Henry has the most potential to come back from all of them. Will Smith too. It‚Äôs not like he didn‚Äôt want to come back. I think they both might. As for Ezra...the guy has started to piss me off. He needs to put his other work aside and make a freaking Flash film or get him recast ASAP.,2
That‚Äôs a Hulk villain I think.,2
> would have  Thank you for that.,1
Idris Elba is not going to be Deadshot...,3
I think he just meant *he* didn't quit on us. It's WB that's holding back on making a new movie. Whether it's a recast or not Henry wants us to know this is not on him.,1
They pretty much gave Elba a new character *because* they wanted Smith to have a shot at returning. I think Smith returning is even higher than Cavill,1
Hulk beat up a cringey junkie with bad tattoos? Good for him,0
I know but it‚Äôs Idris Elba and imo he‚Äôll likely be a bigger character than Deadshot y‚Äôknow,2
"Yeah I think the point is that he‚Äôs not done, there‚Äôs just no movies with Superman in them currently in the pipeline. When/if Supergirl starts production I could see them bringing him in.",1
"Who knows if it's remotely feasible. All I know is that Steppenwolf as he exists in the theatrical cut is poorly rendered, poorly animated and most importantly, poorly portrayed.   A complete whiff as a villain.",3
"Nothing preventing it other than priorities.  Is it worth the time and money to update the design?  Not a VfX artist, but it may also not be as simple as a cut-n-paste of one design vs the other, if there are size and shape differences to the character model.   Also, possible creative-related question: did the approach to Steppenwolf‚Äôs dialogue or voice acting change with the design change?",1
WB doesn‚Äôt work like that and they probably never will. They haven‚Äôt even acknowledged this movie yet. Don‚Äôt run into conclusions. First step is for them to acknowledge it and then you can hope that you may see it someday(me too).,1
"I really love the more alien design, I have never been particularly fond of the comics/animated Steppenwolf who looks like a Hun soldier from Mulan.   The Sonic redesign cost 5 million dollars and that is basically for a cartoon character. Full redesign of a realistic live action character in a 3 1/2 hour film would likely be vastly more expensive. So I highly doubt it would happen, it seems that WB think its too expensive to finish the current VFX for Justice League, let alone funding any new work.   > No excuses about money. It's safe to assume the fans can fund it themselves. Snyder cut funded by fans, not WB.  Come on bro, be serious.",1
"If they could do it for Sonic, then I don't see why not. Zack was ostensibly able to get the VFX done for Steppenwolf and Uxas/Darkseid already, so I dunno if he would wanna change it.",1
"Hey, some of the fans hash tagging releasethesnydercut are celebrities. They aren't going to donate one dollars. Besides, I'm sure there are professionals that would volunteer their free time to help finish the cgi.",0
I just wanna see Tom in a Superman suit,3
"He looks great.   While I don't have much confidence in the CW to do a good job on the Crisis event (their shows, IMO, have really taken a nosedive in quality), I still want to watch it solely for the amount of people they've got to play these roles.",3
"I stopped watching the CW shows years ago, but you can bet your arse I will be watching the shit out of this.",3
So excited for this,1
"Oh, how I‚Äôd love a Snyder-directed Kingdom Come.",2
More like dc fan come,1
Incredible.  I LOVE the Kingdom Come books. It is so incredibly epic.  Let's home this crossover event lives up to that level of epicness.,2
Me as well,2
"If Tom doesn't want to see Tom in a Superman suit, Tom's not gonna be in a Superman suit. Really hype for Brandon's comeback though.",2
Their crossovers are usually the best part of every show. I‚Äôm hoping at the very least this will be the best one Yet.,3
"I've been a constant CW DC fan since the beginning.  You are correct there have been some ups and downs.  However, their crossovers each year have been amazing.  While I can respect your choice if you don't want to watch the Crisis.  I believe this will be fantastic.  They always bring their A-game for the crossovers.",3
"I can see and respect your opinion on them, but IMO (minus the awful wedding interruption by that garbage Felishitty character), I thought Crisis on Earth-X was MANY times more enjoyable than the Justice League movie...though to be honest that wasn't very hard to do.",3
All of their shows are phenomenal this season. They‚Äôre doing a good job of build up for the crisis.,1
"Supergirl Season 4 is really, really good and should be watched by any DC fan.",1
I'm pretty sure it will thousand times better than the load of turd that Snyder dropped that we called DCEU.,0
THAT would be his magnum opus imo. Either that or a 'Dragon Ball' Live Action project i.e. 5-film saga lol,1
That Kingdom Come suit is glorious,3
"I know the CW shows haven't had the most consistency among them however this season i've pretty much enjoyed everything they've been doing among Supergirl , Arrow , The Flash , Black Lightning and Batwoman it's probably their strongest start to any season.  This gives me high expectations for the Crisis event especially with the caliber of people they've got for guest appearances. Just seeing Kevin Conroy in that image gives me chills i'm gonna cry tears of joy when i see him in action.",1
"Yeah I really feel like the writers are on the ball this year, it's been very consistent.",1
Seriously bat woman? One of the worst show ever with that awful Ruby rose,1
"It's about time , Arrow has been up and down with each season although it's been on a strong upswing since Season 5 i wanna say maybe Season 6.  The Flash for me has been the biggest disappointment 1 great season followed by 3 mediocre seasons. Supergirl oddly enough has been the most consistent for me , Black Lightning i'll watch but idk what they're going for it's kinda just staying at one level neither great or bad just sorta good to watch.  Legends of Tomorrow is a good silly show to watch them jump around from different points in history i felt the magic season was a bit wasted i expected some Zatanna and Etrigan or Mordred to show up along with Morgaine le Fey. And finally Batwoman has been a good start way better than Supergirls first episodes which took some time  to get good",1
"Arrow season 6 was meh though, Diaz is among the worst villains I've seen in any superhero show/movie/cartoon.",1
To each their own i felt Diaz was a great villain equal to Deathstroke,1
The main problem with Diaz is that he relied on other characters xrapping their pants in front of him being incompetent for diaz to look menacing.,1
She‚Äôs leading the Eternals movie as Sersi though.....,3
"I‚Äôll watch anything if Gemma Chan is in it, so yeah",2
Gemma Chan will probably portray her 3rd Marvel character before doing a DC Movie at this point.,2
Lady Shiva tho,1
I don't know who this is but yes.,1
Talia al Ghul,1
I mean she had a role in Captain Marvel too right? Not impossible. Is Sersi a big character?,1
Calling what she did on Captain Marvel a character is being generous,1
For the MCU she may be. She‚Äôs the Eternal that will most likely be on the next Avengers team.,2
I think Eternals is supposed to be focusing on Sersi and Black Knight's love story... not sure tho,1
Literally the lead role.,1
I had that poster when the movie came out. Awesome art.,3
Didnt know this was him but its clearly his style.   He is my favorite comic artist. And when he worked with Brian Azzarello there is no comparison,2
Lee Bermejo supports both the Snyder Cut and the Batawang  **MY MAN**,3
I wish Lee Bermejo did official posters for the DC films.,2
I remember this. I love it. Here's what impresses me the most: Bermejo is self-taught. He has done format art courses. His Joker design predates The Dark Knight and was spot on. This was at a time when Lachy Hulme's (saw him in Preacher last) name was in the mix.,1
That art is spectacular! Here's the [full color version](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0558/2081/files/Mondo_JusticeLeague_Bermejo_Sm_1_7ab58abb-1619-48d5-a2c6-bd558bf9cdfb_1024x1024.jpg).  \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,1
"If they are actually going to do this, not likely though, they better at least finish it. I dont give a fuck if it's the original vision if it's full of unfinished cgi, animatics, sound stages and green screen.",0
Oh yes. Lex Luthor: Man of Steel and Joker were both great.,2
Say what you will about Batman: Damned. The art was something to behold.,1
"It would have been interesting to see his take on Shazam -- he's typically associated with darker material, but I bet he could pull it off.",1
It seems more likely now then ever. I don't want to get my hopes up but it's never had traction like this before. I also think it is far more complete than we were lead to believe.,1
"My favorites of theirs is Batman Damned, but I love everything these two do for themselves and together.  Brian Azzarello's Europa is one of my favorite shorter stories.  As well as Future's End and For Tomorrow",1
I'm just saying. An unfinished movie is just as bad as a bad movie. If it is completed then that would be awesome. But I dont want it to be release for fan service amd it's full of green screen.,0
"Yeah I hear you there. I mean why bother if it's just going to look like shit? Especially with Snyder, I mean people may hate his movies, but they can't deny that visually they are beautiful. Would be a shame to release something that looked anything less.",1
"Or...you know, just do a continuation story with Superman whose now accepted on Earth.   MoS 2 is practically primed as a clean slate.",3
What out of the box thinking.,3
We don't even know for sure if Reeves is doing a completely separate universe for Batman or not. Just keep everything in DCEU.,3
When you have characters like the Flash or Dr Fate you can basically rearrange the universe however you want.,3
>reboot Superman  üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ,3
"If I'm wishing for stuff, I'd rather have a JL sequel with Affleck again where we complete Snyder's goal of having Batman eventually die, and then he could pass the mantle on to whoever else, be it Pattinson or someone else.  But I just love Affleck Batman, so if Reeves wants his Batman movie to stay out of the canon of the rest, I say why not let him?",3
Yes to JJ and Henry. No to rebooting It into the Pattinson verse.  Just give us two more great Superman movies with Henry.  No crossovers. No JL setups. Just Superman!,2
How about they just do injustice where Snyderverse is the evil regime side of things and  Abrams does the Resurgency and eventually they do an elseworlds crossover I know mind boggling where Affleck meets Pattinson and they just recast everyone,1
"Nope, no fuckin way. He can't even finish a screenplay and his own character arcs.",3
"JJ should stick to TV, just like Whedon. That's the format where they can deliver good stuff.",1
"The only thing I don't like about Abrams is all of his mystery box baiting. Just tell a story, stop making shit up to get fans talking that you don't really have a plan for.  If he can cut that shit out then he'd be great for Superman.",1
"I don't find JJ Abrams filmography particularly inspiring, especially if you compare it to say, Nolan.   Why do people rate him so highly as a director?",2
"If I was Cavill-Supes and I had to fear a human, it would be Battfleck.  I have no qualms with Pattinson. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll make a fine noir-style Batman in a detective-based film. But there‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äôd ever buy Cavill-Supes ever acknowledging him as a worthy opponent, much less someone to be feared.",2
"I'm reserving judgement until I've seen Rise of Skywalker, if he can make that half decent then I will trust him with Superman, so far though he comes off as...slimey, there is something that makes me not trust him.",1
Nah I'd rather just have Man of Steel 2 in the DCEU And recast Affleck with Jon Hamm to maintain DCEU Batman continuity,1
matt bomer would be perfect for a reboot,1
keep them in the same universe but have the stories be self contained (not like the marvel movies) until you're ready to take another crack at JL,1
"You cant really reboot a movie if the actor is unchanged. Changing the actor is kinda important for a reboot. Changing the actor makes it clear that its a reboot. If you dont change the actor, the audience will just think its a sequel",1
Michael B. Jordan as Clark Kent Superman,1
"Why not just have Reeves tie in his Batman movies to the DCEU and it‚Äôs just, like, way before BvS",1
"Ehh. JJ has great ideas, but as proven with SW, he would make a soft-reboot/remake using the OG movie, and he would use a lot of mystery boxes that he wouldn't know the answers for. But, if he would make his Superman:Flyby script, that would be nice, it had a lot of cool ideas and concept art, just hire a better writer.",1
Can I downvote this more than once?,1
It could work. I would support it. I'd rather have a shared universe rather than just solo universes.   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,0
That‚Äôs all I want. Embrace the future people!,1
Henry has too much negative baggage as Superman. Why would WB invest more money into Cavill as Superman when every movie he‚Äôs appeared in as Superman is critically panned and underwhelming at the box office?   I‚Äôm all for JJ rebooting Superman into his buddy Matt Reeves‚Äô Batman universe but with a new actor. A total reboot.,0
"What part does people do not understand that the movies are based on the same universe but won't show anything related to others aka cameos?  Gentlemen, we are talking about DC  D"" Fucking""C Comics. I by no means am an expert on the topic but I'm pretty sure there's enough source material to say "" HEY! CERTAIN [INSERT SUPERHERO] or CERTAIN [INSERT VILLAIN] FUCKED IT UP AND NOW EVERYONE IS TOGETHER!""",0
I think The Batman is DCEU,0
"Agreed, whether the Snyder Cut comes out or not, is canon or not. Superman is back and ready to be the inspiring Superman everyone loves. Just get on with it!",2
Luthor needs to be recasted to keep Superman in universe.,0
Yeah where are these people getting their info from? There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre going to make Batman movies and not incorporate them with a larger DC Universe that they are obviously trying to slowly piece back together. I don‚Äôt buy that.,3
"The DCEU is going through a soft reboot right now, with those R-rated standalone movies like Joker are gonna be separate from the DCEU.",1
Didn‚Äôt LOST eventually shit the bed though,1
"He's clearly adept at making crowd-pleasing blockbusters. He's taken 3 separate franchises which were on the downswing, and catapulted them back to mainstream and critic appeal. That's no easy feat, and to do it thrice is incredible.",3
Comparing him to Nolan is so unfair. Comparing 98% of filmmakers to Nolan is unfair.,2
"Because he made a perfectly vanilla and non-compelling Star Wars flick that made bank.   I'll never forget. I bought NINE tickets opening weekend to take most of my extended immediate family. We were all so amped going in. When we left the theater I don't think anyone of us even cared to talk about the film. Skipped Last Jedi, which as it turns out, I actually truly enjoyed at home.",2
Do you have even one example of him acting ‚Äúslimey‚Äù?,1
I highly doubt they‚Äôd give us two live action Batmen at the same time,2
Solved,1
Or Richard Armitage. Either or.,0
I did it for you.,1
"Huh? MoS wasn't critically panned or underwhelming at the box office. It was critically reviewed as ""meh"" and did very well at the box office considering that people didn't really care about Superman anymore. Plus, even a lot of people that hate the movies he's in think he can be a great Superman. They just wanted to rush to the brighter one instead of buildup like the Post-Crisis arc.",2
I don‚Äôt think so,0
I‚Äôm fine with Eisenberg as Luthor he just needs to be written better. He‚Äôs also primed to be ruthless Luthor we were hoping for.   If they were to recast then Corey Stoll was always my main pick.,2
"As much as I didn't like Eisenberg's portrayal of Luthor (or, let's say, the way the character was written), I don't see the point of recasting him.",2
This Batman movie has new Gordon.,2
What did you enjoy most in Last Jedi?,1
"Man of Steel was divisive at best, critics didn‚Äôt really like it, fans were split, and general audiences didn‚Äôt care for it resulting in an underwhelming box office. It *did* underperform at the box office. Doctor Strange, an unpopular D List Marvel character that literally nobody knew outside some comic readers, made more money than Superman, the A list, most famous, popular, and recognizable comic book character ever created. Freaking Ant-Man almost made more money than SUPERMAN.   The next film where Cavill starred as Superman was BvS. A film despised by critics, split by fans, and the general audience didn‚Äôt flock out the theaters and see it over and over again. General audiences don‚Äôt connect with Cavill as Superman. The film was a mess and derailed the DCEU.    Next up? Justice League. And we all know how that went.    So if I‚Äôm WB, why would I put another $230 million into a Cavill led Superman flick when there‚Äôs already 3 clear examples of why it doesn‚Äôt work? He has so much negative baggage with the role.",1
there's no chance in hell that they would have a DCEU and NOT include Batman in it. And there is even less chance that they'll have reeves batman not be in it and a 2nd batman be in it.,1
"Yeah? It has a new lead as Batman too! There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that they are keeping everything that works with the DC Universe and just redoing the things that didn‚Äôt. They‚Äôll keep Wonder Woman, aquaman, Shazam and whoever else they think works still and then they will soft reboot Pattinson as Batman and whatever other characters they need to change. Affleck is out. He‚Äôs not coming back. So the DCEU is gonna need a Batman. They‚Äôre gonna make 3 with Pattinson and not have a Batman for their extended universe? They‚Äôll find a way to get people to understand the change and nobody will care if the movies are written better and give the directors creative freedom. They are still fighting for a DCEU! Plus cavil is pretty much saying he‚Äôs not done yet. They are regrouping and bringing in people that know the content. Let‚Äôs get real here people. At the end of the day it‚Äôs about money for the studios and they‚Äôre not just going to let Justice League sit and collect dust.",3
So? Gordon was in like two scenes.,2
"Simmons was Gordon for what amounted to what, 3 minutes of screen time? Maybe?",1
"Honestly Luke for the most part. He was always my way into Star Wars. But I also found the furthering of Rey and Kylo pretty interesting.   I don't care for the ""side story"" of the Resistance pretty much at all. Finn, Poe and the rest are lost on me.",2
">  Superman, the A list, most famous, popular, and recognizable comic book character ever created. Freaking Ant-Man almost made more money than SUPERMAN.  Yet the previous movie about Superman, Superman Returns, was a box office disaster.",1
"1. Literally everyone I talk to in real life (Including complete strangers) at least liked (Not necessarily loved) MoS. Check the RT audience score. Hell even the critic score isn't bad, just meh. Again, it wasn't panned like you said.   2. It did better than Returns at the box office, so that was already a win for Superman. As well, people really overinflate the popularity of Superman now. The truth is the generations born starting in the late 80s either hate any version that isn't like the DCAU or they just don't care. By 2016, Marvel had the trust to earn money off of characters like Doctor Strange and Ant-Man, not to mention great marketing for both films (WB struggles a lot with marketing). By 2015, people would see anything with the Marvel name on it. Superman on the other hand only had two hit movies in his lifespan. So while he was recognizeable, the GA didn't really care enough. So when they saw reviews for MoS, they took that as fact and didn't see the movie.   3. Critics hated BvS. The GA on average thought it was, well, average. Again, RT audience score. And given the ungodly mess of a theatrical cut, I don't blame them. But Cavill wasn't the problem people had with the movie. In fact, the cast was generally praised (Minus Eisenburg). Critics hated the overall tone, and the audiences hated the fact that in the theatrical state the movie made absolutely no sense and they had no idea what was going on (Again, I don't blame them).   4. Again, the problems people had with Josstice League were inconsistent tone, phoned in reshoots, and absolutely abysmal VFX. Not Cavill's acting.   5. I see it all the time online from people who hate Snyder's Supes: ""Cavill would be SO good with someone else writing"". Or any variation of that sentiment. People like Henry Cavill. They like him as Superman. What put people off is what Goyer, Zack, and Joss all were doing with his Superman. Granted, the whole point was to build up to a more optimistic Supes (Just like the Post-Crisis arc...). But people didn't seem to get that when MoS came out, and theatrical BvS especially cut out basically 90% of his significance, making it seem like we were always going to be stuck with a dark Superman.   6. And you know what, I'll admit. The timing probably wasn't right for a deconstructionist, Post-Crisis long developed Supes. In 2013 people were kinda sick of darker CBMs, and especially after Returns people just sort of wanted Superman to feel a bit less sad (Though I'll still say MoS and BvS are 10x more optimistic than THAT gloomfest). But the point stands...   7. Cavill was never the problem people had with the movies. His potential is one of the most praised things. And you talk about a business perspective here, but the flaw there is that despite about 70% of Keanu Reeves movies flopping in the late 90s and 2000s, studios kept giving him money. And we ended up getting John Wick. M Night Shayamalan made disaster after disaster in the 2000s, but he ended up giving us Split. A studio pumped in money for that. Second winds happen, the GA isn't so stupid that they would think otherwise.",1
This is just depressing to read.,2
"I've always believed this is what they are doing. After Justice League, WB pumped the brakes on any grand plans the DCEU had and are focusing on standalone stories while they sort through and put everything back together. While I think the DCEU will remain director driven with pocket universes (Atlantean, Shazam, Gotham, etc.) going forward, I think if the hits keep coming WB will start getting comfortable with crossovers again and eventually do another Justice League movie. This time it will be more successful because it will be separated from the divisiveness of the early DCEU era and people will have come to know and love the characters better.  As far as Batman goes, Affleck departed the role and Matt Reeves has full creative control. I think it is a hard reboot of Batman within the DCEU. Reeves wanted a younger Batman and was given the power to recast Alfred and Gordon to better fit his vision. I'm sure that characters like Harley and Deadshot are off limits for recasting. With Gotham City Sirens likely getting greenlit if Birds of Prey is successful, WB would be stupid not to have Zoe Kravitz reprise her role as Catwoman when she will be seen as such after appearing in The Batman. It's logical for Reeves' movie to remain in the DCEU.",2
So these movies are in different universe. Or Reeves just doesn't care about logic at all and wants to make a movie successful by putting all familiar characters in it.,0
"And the 2 films prior.   Both MoS and BvS have aged incredibly well, and I still believe now, at the end of the Marvel IW saga, both MoS and BVS: Ultimate would have faired much better with reviewers.",1
...Because it was bad? Like BvS and JL and how many view MOS.,1
"None of that negates the fact that WB has no reason or interest in dishing out more money for a Cavill led Superman film when the past 3 didn‚Äôt work. General audiences don‚Äôt have the same connection with Cavill as Superman as they did with other comic book characters like Christopher Reeve, Hugh Jackman, RDJ, etc etc. You and your friends liked them, that‚Äôs great, but they aren‚Äôt winners across the board. BvS RT audience score is 63%.... thats 4% away from Rotten...   Split‚Äôs budget was $9 million dollars. That‚Äôs why they gave M. Night the green light. Not the $200+ a Superman film needs. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make sense financially.",1
"I'd bet that he doesn't,  that Reeves Batman has his own Batverse but no DCEU connections. I think they learned from their mistakes and are avoiding the Marvel route. That massive expansive story. Maybe a tenuous connection at best, like small Easter eggs. It's hard to have filmmaker driven movies when they are beholden to other people's creative visions for the sake of consistency. So in essence I kind of agree with the pocket universe idea, I just don't believe Pattinson will join the the other DC characters. Just Batman characters. I don't think Reeves or Pattinson would have done it if it was going to be in that Marvel vein with a potential for more than a trilogy. I imagine they have a rather specific story to tell. I don't think we need buildup to get a JL movie. Yes WB needs to get a string of hits under the DC banner to build confidence to fund the movie, but I think they could just film a JL movie that starts with them already established. Without having all the intro movies, like JL Mortal was going to be.",1
You realize in Iron Man and Iron Man 2 James Rhodes was recast right?,3
‚ÄúBoth MoS and BvS have aged incredibly well‚Äù  Maybe to you?,1
"Good and bad is subjective when it comes to art, but yeah, Superman Returns was disliked by the audience. So despite Superman's popularity, it's not that easy to make a financially successful movie about him. And if a previous movie about character X flopped, it becomes even more difficult to promote another movie about him. Did you really expect MoS to make a billion?",1
"You aren't listening. What I'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter that people don't like the movies. Half of the Reeve movies were panned even harder than MoS and BvS. Yet people still acknowledge Reeve as fantastic. Cavill is also acknowledged as having a lot of potential BY PEOPLE WHO HATE MOS AND BVS. That's what I'm trying to say, is that liking MoS and BvS is irrelevant. Just like people who hated BvS still loved Ben and Gal. And people who hated JL loved Momoa. You haven't been listening to what I'm saying at all.",1
Let's not forget the drastic change of Edward Norton to Mark Ruffalo with the Hulk. And yet Marvel just kept pushing forward with the MCU.,3
"They hired another actor to play the same character. If Reeves movie is in DCEU, it would mean that DCEU Gotham has two Jim Gordons, who both at some point work as police commissioners, probably one after another. That's just stupid.",0
"I mean they‚Äôre visually stunning, incredibly unique among superhero films, and delve deeper into what makes superheroes well, heroic, than any others in the category. They explore themes like nature vs. nurture, the destructiveness of vengeance, the power of choice, our identity and the world around us, fear of the unknown, and others that are all still very important today.  So yeah, I‚Äôd say they‚Äôve aged well.",1
"Nope. But WB was disappointed with the final box office and profit of the film. BvS on the other hand should‚Äôve made $1 Billion easy and the box office for that film is inexcusable. From a business prospective, it makes no sense for WB to continue to invest in a Cavill led Superman film when the past 3 didn‚Äôt work financially and critically. DC Films (or whatever it‚Äôs called) seems to be distancing itself from the ‚ÄúDCEU‚Äù  The Batman is a reboot, Cavill as Superman is all but confirmed to be done, and Aquaman and Wonder Woman 1984 moved away from the dark and gritty cynical tone of the past.",1
This......makes absolutely no sense....I don't understand what you're trying to convey.,2
You alright man?,2
"Or, now this might shock you, the'yre just the same person and it's set in a different decade. I feel like you're only basing this of physical appearence of the actors IRL. Not the character in universe. It honestly doesn't matter since The Batman is in the 90s, not after or close to before JL.",1
The most important thing for me is that they show what would happen if superheroes really appeared in our world. I don't feel that with MCU movies - even though I like some of them.,2
"Imagine if Reeves movie is in DCEU.  Pattinson's Batman can age in Affleck's Batman. Wright's Gordon can't age in Simmons Gordon. Which means there are two Gordons in this universe, having the same job, one in 90s, another in 2010s.",0
"Yes, what about you?",0
Isn‚Äôt it being based in the 90s still just rumors? Has that been confirmed by anyone? I‚Äôm betting on it being modern day and the same universe as everyone else.,2
"Last time I checked, normal human beings living in Gotham age like real people and can't magically change their race.",0
There is no confirmation that this movie will be in the 90s. It will likely be a hard Batman reboot set in the present day.,2
"Regardless, a recast  for Gordon isn't a big deal. This guys whole point was the actors look different physicaly irl.",2
What were your thoughts when the MCU Hulk changed from a white man to an italian man?,2
You didn't even read my comment. Shows how up your own ass you are about this. I'm done with this convo.,1
"Earlier you said that you want to keep everything in DCEU. You can't keep ""everything"" if you reboot Batman. In fact, you can keep barely anything since Ben's Batman is involved in all major events in DCEU.",0
Yeah I‚Äôm not referring to a damn thing that kid says. He‚Äôs obviously a little off. I‚Äôm just saying the 90s thing is still a rumor.,1
I mean you could just say from one actor to a different one. Found the Italian descent comment funny.,1
"I meant everything going forward. A hard reboot of Batman does not contradict what I said. Retcons have existed in franchises for a long time, and this would be one.",2
For a second I thought his sword was his middle finger and he was flicking us off lol,3
I can't believe that I will never get to see Ben Affleck's Batman going up against Joe Manganiello's Deathstroke üòì,3
I think Joe‚Äôs Deathstroke is the thing I want to see the most in the DCEU. He‚Äôs fucking awesome!,3
Man I really want this Deathstroke to have more than 3 minutes on the big screen,3
Jesus fuck that suit is beautiful,3
Joe and Ray are the ones I feel for most out of the cast. This was supposed to be their gateway to more movies in this universe and more roles in their careers. With Joe being friends with James Gunn I thought he would‚Äôve been included in the new Suicide Squad but there‚Äôs been no news on that. Such a shame,3
Sllllaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyydddddde,3
He deserves his own Deathstroke movie! Look at that suit it‚Äôs too good to be wasted!,3
can we PLEASE get a deathstroke movie?,3
It sucks that we‚Äôll never get to see Lex Luthor and Deathstroke form a league of their own.  I always wonder if casual fans who don‚Äôt follow this stuff like we do are still wondering when that scene is going to have its payoff.,3
Such a better mask than the one from Titans,3
Man if he is in it that would be awesome,3
Imagine a Battfleck/Deathstroke brawl like Arkham? Damn...,3
I wonder if he had a sequence in SC,3
"I wish we got to see more of Joe‚Äôs Deathstroke (I doubt we‚Äôll see much of him in the Snyder Cut, hopefully an extra minute or two). A Batman movie with him would have been amazing",2
"So, I guess there's a theory out there now that all this is hype for HBO Max, that the Snyder Cut will be released on it. Any validity or are we all in for one big collective disappointment?",2
A solo deathstroke movie is too good a opportunity to miss,2
"Out of the three live action Deathstrokes, this one had such massive potential to be incredible. I enjoy each version of the suits but this here, my god, look at the wear and tear! Man I know they‚Äôre soft rebooting Batman but at least keep this one.",2
"There's a lot of movement on the Snyder Cut, I'm loving it.  In the immortal words of Bane, ""The Fire Rishes""",3
I'm just waiting for the moment when I can post a *itshappening.gif*,2
That suit is so badass.,2
Get my mans on the big screen,2
Dont do this...dont give me hope.,1
"The Batfleck and Deathstroke movie that was taken from us, deserves justice!",2
Someone tag James Gunn! He needs to make him a member of the Squad!,2
Looks like NN November is over for me. Sad.,2
"I really didn‚Äôt like the incredibly fake-looking white hair. They should have just stuck with his natural black hair with grey streaks.   But other than that, I absolutely loved how Joe‚Äôs Deathstroke looked and was really excited to see him in Affleck‚Äôs *The Batman* and the *Justice League* sequel. I hope that if we ever get Deathstroke in a new film, it will be him.",3
this shit is so transparently viral marketing and you are all very naiive to not see this IT'S LITERALLY WITH A NEW PROMOTIONAL PHOTO,1
"Only Sadness is Cavill is silent and it feels like he doesn't care about us anymore.Which is surprising to me , I felt that Ben wouldn't participate but I was totally wrong. It feels like ""False God"" from BvS weren't wrong either.",1
This one hurts...I want to see Deathstroke more than any character in a Well done DC movie.,1
"I think I looked at the image from a weird angle in the beginning, looks like Deathstroke is giving the finger to the camera!",1
DC: i dont wanna fight you flash,1
"Interesting, Zack‚Äôs there but Joss did the scene in the movie, must have been another reshoot I guess",1
"i mean, they‚Äôre obviously releasing this",2
Def a HBO stunt now.,2
"he is like "" hold my beer """,1
Wow definitely not marketing!!!,1
Am I the only one here that thought I was getting flipped out by Joe?,1
At first glance I thought he was giving me the finger,1
"more importantly, are we still going to see this version of Deathstroke?",1
We really do need that Batfleck film with Deathstroke. Why WB? Why do you have to screw things up?,1
My god he looks good,1
My pepe hard. I need that Deathstroke film like YESTERDAY!!!  #RelaeseTheSnyderCut,1
"You know, now I‚Äôm even surprised that they kept this credits scene, maybe because they weren‚Äôt expecting the film to flop and canceling the shared universe",2
"So let‚Äôs see Superman, Batman, Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg, Steppenwolf, Darkseid, Desaid, Lex Luthor, Deathstroke, Martian Manhunter, Mera, a Green Lantern, Ares, and possibly Atom nope Instead we got brunch, and a Russian family and breast jokes, and CGI lips and corny lines.",2
God the one thing In The dceu I was really excited about,1
"This suit looks so cool, but I still had my doubts about Manganiello. Deathstroke isn't just a generic badass, and Manganiello isn't the best actor. With Aquaman and Jason Momoa, they kind of made it work by making him more comedic and different overall. Not saying his Slade would have sucked, I'm just not sure if he could portray him accurately without problems.",1
"Obviously it's all DC's marketing stunt either they release the movie or no, how else can you explain the breach of contracts?",1
"Batman: I don't wanna fight you, Deathstroke.  Deathstroke: I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.",1
Who‚Äôs joe?,1
Who's joe?,1
"""It's marketing! You people are so blind!""  We don't care what it is. We're just happy it's happening.",1
The first and last time we will ever see this guy on the big screen....lol,1
#This is doing nothing,1
"Sounds pretty calculated and awesome.  WB thinks it can make more money from the footage they already, actors get more exposure and development of these characters, and everyone's happy.",1
I'm out of the loop. The Snyder cut that people want this time is referring to Justice League's director's cut?,1
Who is joe?,1
"LOOKS SO GOOD, ugh... really want a solo DEATHSTROKE movie.   Whatever happened to Gareth Evans' movie?!",1
This suit is so perfect.,1
Flash Thompson really fell off.,1
Man that really is the best live-action Deathstroke suit,1
Who else accidentally swiped to popular?,1
Who is Joe,0
Who's Joe?,0
Same. Came here to say that ahaha,3
Yup me as well.,3
Exactly! This pic is badass that would have been on another level.,2
Omg i saw that too lol,3
x5,2
"Who ever took that pic must've thought he is taking badass pic, but nope",1
Didn't realize 'till I saw this comment,1
Hahahahahaha me too,1
"\*Flipping.  The term is ""flipping off.""",1
Somebody reply back with a pic of the Joss Whedon version I wanna see the difference compared to this pic.,3
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna fight you Slade.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt wanna fight me neither.‚Äù,3
They did see it fit to bless us with a Jared Leto Joker though... How bad could it have been....,3
Never say never.,2
I can‚Äôt believe we haven‚Äôt seen his Deathstroke do anything more than just stand in one scene.,1
Him vs Battfleck gives New 52 Deathstroke vibes!,3
You guys should try watching Titans. It‚Äôs currently fulfilling all my deathstroke needs.,3
"CW Arrow had a great Deathstroke in season 2. In fact, I find striking similarities with DCEU Deathstroke",1
"That was barely 90 seconds, come on lol",3
He just looks like he's *lived* you know?,3
"Apparently in Snyder's original treatment, he breaks Lex out of Arkham.   And given that Snyder completed principal photography and always aims to shoot a complete movie in that time (not *relying* on reshoots), and that we don't see how Lex gets out or meets Deathstroke, I'd be shocked if there isn't a scene of that waiting to be cleaned up and reinserted.",2
"I completely agree, I want him to get his own movie, he is in my top 3 villains and he is a interesting and awesome character on his own",1
Your name makes me Tear up,3
Anyone know if they planned to put a lens in the mask? Or were we going to be looking at the one eyeball the whole time?,2
"I will never get over Batfleck not getting his own film. It's a damn waste of great casting, presence and potential.  This studio really screwed it all up royally.",3
Can you imagine how awesome it would be if he's in The Suicide Squad and they're just keeping it a secret?,3
"Yup! Green light a movie! That dude did hella good job standing there for 20 seconds!  Pay no mind that Boba Fett who had maybe double the screen time and literally had entire audiences wanting more never got a full movie, but ya this deserved one.",0
What if he's the main villain in The Batman..,2
If warner bros is still making a nightwing movie he could be the main antagonist,1
Yes. I am.,2
"If you're in the UK, most casual viewers still leap for the exit the moment the end credits come up. They only really stop if the movie goes straight into a pre-credits extra scene, like we had in The Wolverine.",1
But man that guy is compelling as fuck,3
"It's the best looking one period. In the Arrowverse it looks like cheap plastic.  Though, Manu Bennett is pretty great Slade.",3
"Yeah Esai's mask is the only thing I don't like much about the Titans Deathstroke, but besides that his suit is gorgeous.",3
Honestly man it looks a lot better in action in the show than it does in the couple of stills and trailers they released. This one is better but I do love the Titans suit.,2
yeah i agree the mask and the sword for me are my least favorite parts about the titans deathstroke suit,2
Meh  that actor is 2 times better than Joe Manganiello. The man has zero range for a layered role like death stroke.,1
He was ‚Äúin the movie‚Äù in that shitty Lex scene,2
Did Zack say that in the SC Deathstroke broke Luthor out of Arkham?,2
"Yeah, remember how Snyder said Deathstroke's appearance was to set him up for the solo Batman movie after?",1
Deathstroke is one of the few side characters in the DC universe that can carry a solo movie imo,2
"Oh they're going to , Trust me. This is all a marketing stunt to get everyone interested",1
"Pardon if I‚Äôm wrong, but isn‚Äôt Slade‚Äôs unnaturally white hair color a result of him receiving the super soldier formula? Maybe I read that wrong but I always thought that was it",3
"I can see that this is all marketing now, ever since the second Gal tweeted, and I quite simply don't care.   If this is how they market to us, allowing us to see the fruits of a successful 2 year campaign, then that to me is a whole hell of a lot more fun than the standard: announcement of a teaser, a teaser, an announcement of a trailer, a trailer, a second trailer, 2 TV spots and then a release.  This is far more exciting than the usual marketing model, now that they've clearly decided to greenlight it in some form.",1
"IMO, Cavill has hinted a few times he isn‚Äôt happy with Synders vision of his character. Shame!",1
I can‚Äôt unsee that! Lol,1
Yes it‚Äôs a known reshoot.  The League of our Own line was green screened in from the reshoots.   There‚Äôs BTS footage of it with the clapperboard mentioning ‚ÄúDir: J. Whedon‚Äù.  Not sure if all the Lex stuff in that scene was a reshoot.  Not sure if any of the Deathstroke footage was reshot.,2
Lol no. I saw the same thing,1
Because if Ben wasn‚Äôt satisfied with his script and he was struggling with his person life then why should they have let him continue?,2
Snyder wasn't in charge of the whole universe. He only was controlling the 5 part Superman arc. WW and Aquaman were both very much Jenkins' and Wan's movies despite growing from the Snyder arc.,1
Do you want us to clap and congratulate your hind sight? This is pointless and will never happen. Everything doesnt have to be the MCU.,2
"And Lois being 'thirsty'. That one hurts more than anything. Seeing Diane Lane and Amy Adams having to deliver those lines is probably the straw that broke the camel's back for me ever seeing that version of Josstice League ever again. And I only watched it reluctantly when it was out on DVD because my then girlfriend wanted to see it. Otherwise I'd still probably not have watched it, waiting for the Director Cut as I did with BVS.",1
I think That‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on too,1
"That, or the NDA expired.",1
x6,2
"Is there a difference? Other than this shot having a better view of it, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a big difference between the two",3
"The reshoots for this scene comprised of Lex saying the line ""We need a league of our own""",3
"Hey Lois, come check out my new birthday present.",2
Kick his ass man,1
YOOO LMAO üòÇ ü§£ üòÜ,1
You dropped this /s I think.,3
Jared is a good Joker.,0
How does it compare to the one from CW's ARROW?,1
"There are many similarities between the CW and Titans' Deathstroke, that being said they are as amazing as each other. My only wish is to have more scenes of Slade in the outfit.",1
Dude people are fucking crazy in here acting like he did more than stand in frame for like 30 seconds. Somehow that means he was perfect as deathstroke?,0
I totally get what you mean.,1
"At the very least I could see there being a few scenes of Joe Manganiello playing an unnamed Arkham guard who is being real shifty. Towards the end of the movie, the guard gets Lex out of there. Cut to the final shot with the guard, now in full Deathstroke gear and revealed to be Slade Wilson, pulling up to Lex's yacht to join the Legion of Doom.",1
"Apparently Ben's Batman script was really fucking good. And he clearly cared a lot about the role. There's no way he would have fucked up that movie, at all.   It's probably the movie cancellation that's hit me hardest, right up just above losing Thomas Jane's Punisher sequel, or Del Toro's Pacific Rim 2.",3
"I get that this sub loves reveals in movies and doesn't want anything ""spoiled,"" but at this point I'd really appreciate if they let us know Joe's Deathstroke would be in the new SS. I don't really have much interest in that movie as it is, but I'd definitely be more curious if he were in it.",1
Which is ?,1
he isn't. That was for Ben's movie. Not Matt. Matt is using Riddler and Penguin as the primary villains it would seem,3
What if Batman was the main villain in his movie?,3
"Every single MCU movie, this bugs me. I feel like even casual viewers should know this by now.",1
"Agreed, and I've only seen trailers",3
"If they had a bigger budget for a better suit, it would have been perfect",3
"I loved Manu Bennett's version of Slade. I didn't mind the ""hard"" mask but i always thought the ""clothed"" version of the mask was pretty sick.",1
Esai is such a great Deathstroke. And his suit is definitely awesome looking.,3
"The Titans suit looks cool, but I feel the mask's orange half should be a bit brighter. Maybe not as bright as the Arrowverse or DCEU suits, but bright enough so his mask doesn't look like a black carbon fiber hockey mask in dimly lit scenes.",1
"That Lex scene was still cool. It was shot by Zack, so...",3
I think it is related. As soon as the fake luthor was revealed it went right to deathstroke,1
I imagine an R-rated solo Deathstroke movie directed by Gareth Evans would be good. I wonder if it'll ever happen.,2
"The guy‚Äôs had numerous ongoings and his  urrwnt oje is about to end at #50, in this day and age that‚Äôs pretty good, so I wouldn‚Äôt consider him a side character at this point. There‚Äôs definitely enough material for a movie or three.",1
"Marketing stunt or not, I'm more than willing to jump to the cinema the day it releases.",1
Correct. Even in the current Deathstroke run there are flashbacks to a younger Slade with pure white hair post-serum. They did it with Manu Bennett and Esai Morales's interpretations as well.,2
"Like Cable, who's hair is white from the techno-virus. They decided to make his hair dark with some grey in it, probably because solid white would've looked fake and just not good in live-action.",1
Hinted? He outright said that version of the character was not the way to go and he wanted a more optimistic and hopeful take,1
Right? It‚Äôs so easy to just come up with a list of fantasy movies.,2
"It's funny becaue when MOS first came out and they announced the DCEU, everyone said, ""I hope they follow their own path and don't copy the MCU"".  Then the DCEU starts to explore the wider world and characters in it and people complain because ""they needed to have solo films before Justice League, like the MCU did"", and ,""DC's films aren't exact copies of Marvel's films, therefore they suck"".",2
I mean people said this before too,1
X7,2
Say no more:    [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104694/?ref\_=nv\_sr\_1?ref\_=nv\_sr\_1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104694/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1),3
"""Shouldn't we have a league of our own?""  That is such a Joss Whedon line. I don't even hate it, it's just so obviously him and that's why the theatrical cut just doesn't work. You can totally tell which scenes, and even which shots, were done by both directors.",1
It‚Äôs a lot better than Arrow‚Äôs. Deathstroke on Titans is menacing and straight up scary at times.,1
Please don't mention Titans and anything CW in the same sentence. Titans feels like the DCU.,1
It‚Äôs up there with arrows Deathstroke run.,0
"At first there was some hope that he would be Batman in Reeves' film after he welcomed him on board and said he was excited to work with him.  It's been a rough few years for the guy with his divorce and alcoholism. Then the reception for BvS, Live by night and finally JL probably knocked the wind out of him. Remember that he got a ton of flak for DD back in the day and he was hoping he could get a win with BvS.  Man, Thomas Jane is my favorite Punisher, but not the version from the movie. The one from Dirty Laundry, which he funded out of his own pocket, was the bomb. Dude looked and behaved like a killer version of Johnny Cash in that one and he was one cool customer. It's also the best unofficial commercial for Jack Daniels ever made.  I know people like to say Bernthal is the best Punisher, but his portrayal was at its peak in the second episode of the second season of DD. After that and in his own show he was too sociable and screamed too much like a gorilla.  Del Toro not doing Pacific Rim 2 is something you come to expect from him, since he's very loosey goosey with projects. He's attached to many and ends up doing only a few. He was originally the one who wanted to do JL Dark.",2
The Pacific Rim 2 that we got was okay but I really would have liked the Del Toro version.,1
Teen Titans go to the movies.,2
"Oh, good...",1
ü§Ø,2
"You, I like the way you think",2
"I mean, Batman's personal demons are his greatest enemy. Well, second greatest after that spout with throat cancer.",1
"After BvS, I'd think Warner Bros. is going to be really careful about doing another controversial Batman storyline. Having him be the villain of Deathstroke's story might be too much for them and I doubt they'd want to fuck with the status quo that quickly after reestablishing it.",1
"He should have been an antagonist for the whole movie in Suicide Squad, would have been absolutely epic to see Batman through their eyes.",1
I think the suit looks good. Just feels like they cheaped out on the mask.,3
The Lex dialogue footage is a reshoot.  At least the close ups were.,2
"I don‚Äôt like the feel, the dialogue, the overall feel",1
"Maybe the scene was longer. I remember reading somewhere that the scene with them wasn‚Äôt post credits in SC, it was a scene in the movie.",2
Yay! üòÅ I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure!,1
"Wait, Manu's Slade had white temples in the present day, like Mr. Fantastic.",1
"He shouldn‚Äôt have signed on to the character. I‚Äôm sure he got a script before committing to the project. Honestly, you ride with your leader till the end. Remember it was ‚Äútheir‚Äù movie and it‚Äôs the main reason why anyone knows Cavill‚Äôs name at this point in his career. Loyalty cause a long way.",1
"Which is weird because Snyder's version of Superman made me finally like the character after more than 30 years of growing up with it, plus his Superman became more hopeful after he became Superman and vanquished Zod.",1
"Considering I rather enjoyed Zacks movies and vision, I'm not.",2
X8,2
Interesting. You didn't think Manu Bennett's version was scary? Remember that one episode when he was in Oliver's house?,1
Good to know!,1
"> I know people like to say Bernthal is the best Punisher,  I think the best Punisher is Ray Stevenson.",1
Didn't see that so didn't catch that . Thanks for clearing it up though,1
That would‚Äôve been dope.,1
"I used to think Manu's mask looked good when he was in the show but now I googled it and yeah, next to Titans' one and especially this, it really does look cheap. I love Manu's performance though.  The leather mask that's impaled on the shore at Lian Yu is cool. Obviously it could never be the final mask but still",2
"Right, I meant they each had white in their hair to some degree after the serum. Temples, salt and pepper, or just all over.",1
Henry has said nothing but positive things about his experience working with Zack on Man Of Steel. That was their baby.,1
X9,2
"I felt like Manu‚Äôs version lacked consistency. He was scary during certain episodes, felt like he was just there at other points. Titan‚Äôs deathstroke feels like he‚Äôs gonna run his sword through our heroes‚Äô hearts every scene he is in.",1
"Lol, wut?",1
You're welcome :)  I'd recommend checking it out especially if you're a fan of meta humour. It's hilarious in sort of Lego Batman way.   https://youtu.be/r3IpPzKtnI8   Here's something to give you an idea of it.,1
It was my favorite movie of the year in 2018. If you like DC you should probably at least rent it.,1
"It looks like plastic and then adding the eye ridge/bump on the eyeless side of the mask, rather than keep it smooth also makes it look awkward.  Buy everything else about the suit works.",1
Are you sure? Because there‚Äôs been conflicting information that suggest ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my Superman‚Äù because he‚Äôs not smiling like an idiot all the time in this a-hope of a word.,1
TIL Marvel fans are still trying to discredit the DCEU for literally no reason at all.,1
"Wow, a dead franchise with 6 confirmed films in production. What a time to be alive.",1
Special Combo Takedown,3
Explains how a Rich guy with no powers is able to defeat anyone with just these two words IAM **BATMAN**,1
C-C-C-COMBO-BREAKER!!,1
Clearly!,1
"Basically ""I don't want any trouble"", context clues, man.",3
Beef means conflict between two people. Have you really never heard that term before?,3
"‚ÄúI consider the consumption of meat morally questionable, do you have any vegetarian options?‚Äù",3
He wants chicken instead. Or maybe a veggie burger.,3
"He wants chicken, not beef. Duh.",3
"He‚Äôs trying to eat more lean meats, like another commenter said chicken, but also turkey, venison, or fish would be a healthier option to balance out his diet.",2
"It's another way of saying ""Never rub another man's rhubarb"". Just the meat version.",2
Mfw the flight attendant asks what I‚Äôll have to eat.,1
"Monster T (the gangster Joker was talking to) referred to Harley as ‚Äúa bad bitch‚Äù which Joker took offense to, when T realized Joker felt disrespected he said he didn‚Äôt want any beef. Beef is slang for conflict",1
he doesn't want no beef,1
"Not common for non Americans (source, non American non native speaker)",1
"That's what I thought he meant. But why does he fear conflict to begin with?  Edit: Wow, what is wrong with you guys?",0
"No he saw he liked her, it's why Joker started to offer her to him. It's why Monster T gets so uncomfortable. I hear before the reshoots that Joker gets him to shoot himself in the head instead of dealing with Joker's torture. - wish they kept that in",2
"Yeah, but are context clues not a thing outside of the US?",2
I'm from the UK and it was common enough for me,0
He likely doesn't fear conflict.     He potentially fears conflict with a certified psychopath who murdered the sidekick of the other dude everyone in town is afraid of.,3
"It can be incredibly difficult especially with idioms or other colloquial phrases where the words already have other/existing meanings.  Besides, everyone learns at a different rate :)",2
The uk shares a language with America and lots of pop culture. Very different for someone from Southern Africa or South East Asia for example.,1
"And that's why I'm sad we'll never see Leto and Affleck together on screen. Yeah sure the Bat is scary but Joker proved that after all he's just a guy dressed like a bat. That's why he wears his ""trademarks"" as tattoos and also why his strippers wear a Batman mask: he's mocking him.   But then again I guess this wasn't as interesting as his relationship with Harley Quinn. /s",1
Gotta market to those Hot Topic tweens my man /s,1
I thought i was the only one who enjoyed it! I agree and it had some great fight scenes in it. It was actually a really good animated DC movie.,3
That last fight was brutal too,2
"I really enjoyed the movie, not in the highest ranks of DC‚Äôs animated movies in terms of quality but, very enjoyable overall.",2
"No demeaning men in a WW film, huh?  So what you‚Äôre saying is...Joss Whedon didn‚Äôt write it.",1
I hated it but I‚Äôm glad other people enjoyed it.,1
"So they did ADR and had the pre-viz back in January, the VFX must be at ***the very least*** the level of theatrical-cut Steppenwolf, wouldn't it?",3
"Yes, ADR is done after picture is locked (runtime finalised). It is one of the final stages of post-production.",3
That‚Äôs pretty fast though since filming ended November I think. Maybe Zack works scene by scene or something.,2
Maybe Gadot had to do her work earlier because of her busy Wonder Woman schedule. There‚Äôs no way a movie like JL was in the final stages of post-production 10 months before release.,0
Thanks captain obvious,0
"Principal photography ended in October 2016. Zack starts working on VFX heavy shots while doing principal photography or even earlier. That‚Äôs why those 2 vfx guys Brian Hirota and John ‚ÄúDJ‚Äù Desjardin said that most of the vfx shots in the Snyder cut are complete.  Edit: Also Zack ‚Äúshoots what he draws‚Äù and he draws his own storyboards. So there‚Äôs no need for additional retakes/reshoots after principal. He has a clear vision for how the movie is going to progress from start to finish which helps him cut his movie quickly.   He may need brief pickup shots due to an actor‚Äôs scheduling or lower priority shots which are very short like Harry Lennix‚Äôs MM transformation shot which was probably only a few seconds but nothing for any of the main cast members.   Since JL was shooting in the UK, it was not viable flying Lennix all the way from LA just for a 5 seconds shot. So that‚Äôs why Zack said he intended to shoot the Lennix part in LA later.",3
He does. IIRC Jay Oliva confirmed this.,2
What? No. It was in post production.  [Zack Snyder: ‚ÄúWW working hard in LA on post of JL‚Äù](https://imgur.com/a/AQtG8NJ),2
"Who said it was final stages?  Anyway, it does put to rest (as if it wasn‚Äôt already) the idea that JL was just a loose collection of dailies and pre-viz when Snyder got thrown under the bus.",1
Not many people know that. Some people still believe the Snyder cut is an ‚Äúassembly cut‚Äù.,3
"Zack is a very ""in the moment"" director. He cuts the film together and works on VFX while they're filming and during reshoots. His films are always essentially finished months before release.",3
Of course. But not the ‚Äúfinal stages‚Äù. These types of movies are worked on until about a month or so before the release.,0
‚òùÔ∏è üíØ,2
Not with Zack. He gets things done early.,2
I mean what about Shazam though...,3
Would Shazam vs Black Adam count as Black Adam 2 and Shazam 3?,3
"The Rock may want him, but WB is a different story.",3
I mean it would super premature to have Supe isn‚Äôt he first BA movie especially considering we‚Äôre already getting heavy hitters like Hawkman.,3
Cavill‚Äôs Superman & Shazam VS Black Adam in *Shazam 3* or *Black Adam 2.*,3
So they‚Äôre saying he wouldn‚Äôt even be in the Black Adam vs Shazam movie but he‚Äôd make an appearance in Black Adam‚Äôs sequel?  I‚Äôm confused,2
Lmao @ keeping Cavill on ice for another 3-4 years. Not sure if Superman or Captain America.,2
"How the hell would she know , the movie probably doesn't even have a script  yet.  I swear she just pulls shit from out of the air and hopes it's true.  The day she stops reporting DC news would be the best day for me as a DC fan",1
"Lol @ anyone who believes this. Black Adam 2 would hypothetically come out in 2024 or later, meaning 5 years *or longer* from now. If WB has already planned Supes next appearance, it definitely isn't in a non-Superman film sequel that will likely be released in the latter half of the 2020s. People really have to learn to exercise some degree of discernment when reading claims from lower-level scoopers.",2
She just says what everybody want to hear. I can not believe that people think that this kind of social media personalities have any reliability.,1
"Gotta say if Black Adam 2 is the only way to get Superman in a movie again they may as well recast. Black Adam comes out the end of 2021, basically 2022, so the sequel likely wouldn‚Äôt come until end of 2023/early 2024 at the earliest, almost 7 years removed from Henry‚Äôs last portrayal of the character.",1
"That‚Äôs all I care about. Him coming back. Please be true, even though I definitely not trust Rundolf.",1
Black Adam 2?? Why?? It should be a one and done deal. Just put everyone in Shazam 3,1
"https://youtu.be/ytbzMuC0mYo  How hyped would you be if they kept Supes appearance in Shazam vs Black Adam a secret? Then, in the final battle scene something like the above link happens...",1
"If Rock tweets ""RTSC"" then we will be getting it üòÅ",1
Meanwhile why not make MOS 2 while we wait and farewell with mos 3,1
"Almost 10 years of Rock talking trash about Black Adam  and it‚Äôs not even out yet and we are talking Black Adam 2. Yeah ok, with the Rock making Fast And Furious 14 and Jumanji into Space I highly doubt either Rock or Cavill will be sliding into either role for a sequel in the next 8 years. Good luck with that",1
Some people don‚Äôt get that Henry doesn‚Äôt say anything about the SC because he actually doesn‚Äôt want to do anything with that film anymore. He had shared his disappointment to his character‚Äôs arc in JL until Geoff Johns came in and he said that he and Geoff tried to bring Superman from the comicbooks which again didn‚Äôt work as Henry recently said.   Henry just wants a soft reboot of his character with a new movie and probably hopes a director wants to do that with him. I hope for that too.,0
"Ugh, Grace Randolph has demonstrated time and time again that she knows nothing about scoops and she's never been right about anything. Can we stop spreading her lies once and for all?",0
"I'd know why, but I just can't help this feeling that he doesn't really care that much about Shazam...",3
I mean we have seen Superman fight Black Adam a lot (In fact I hope we see a DC presents type thing with Superman and Shazam fighting Black Adam)  Plus Superman is kinda the archetypal superhero   ~~Though I kinda hope this is him teasing for Superman being in the Shazam sequel~~,1
Fixed: Black Adam v Shazam,1
"WB caves to the Rock 10 times out of 10. In wrestling terms, WB would be jobbed out to the Rock",3
"Rock is the biggest movie star, they are gonna do what he wants",1
Result: $$$$$$$$$$$$$$,2
"Black Adam vs Shazam will happen only in ""Shazam 3""",1
"""Lower-level scooper"" haha, you better know",1
Nobody is saying this is his next film appearance. I don‚Äôt even like Grace but you‚Äôre misconstruing what‚Äôs being said for no reason.,0
"Tbh a potential MoS 2/Superman movie could realistically come out in 2023 at the earliest anyway. Before Superman there will be Shazam 2, New Gods, Flash and Joker 2 ( I'm sure it will happen after how big of a success it was and how Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix changes their tune after it broke out. I don't think it should be made but I am sure WB is trying theit damn hardest) for sure and potentially an Wonder Woman 3 and Gotham City Sirens. I can't see it before 2023 anyway",1
"""In my opinion, this is the first time we see Superman in truth. We have seen the origin story of Superman.(MOS) We have seen the downfall and doubt of Superman. (BVS) And finally with this rebirth we see the true Superman. (JL) The Superman who is confident, and sure, full of hope and joy.""      These comments were made in 2016 during the filming of Justice League, 100% under Zacks direction.",2
False. He just says what's best for PR since JL,1
Kinda dumb that he has such a hard on for being on screen with Superman when he is the arch nemesis of Shazam. And they really need to get on the Shazam sequel before all those kids get hit by puberty like a truck.,3
#Facts,3
"Highly doubt that, but we shall see if WB turns into the Wyatt Family against Rock.",1
Know what exactly? Grace doesn‚Äôt know shit,2
"If the screenshotted tweet is specifically referring to Superman's next appearance in the Shazam/Black Adam films, as opposed to his next film appearance *period*, then it's still not believable, imo. Black Adam 2 would literally be in 2025 or beyond. WB isn't currently planning for a Superman appearance in that film, c'mon. To me, it's an obvious BS, pulled out of thin air claim. And I'm not trying to crap on Randolph at all.",1
"Yeah, and this wasn't like lying about it on the press circuit to get people to go to the movie in theaters. This was far before filming finished and waaaaaay before the release and press tour. There's little incentive to lie like this - if he wanted to ""lie by omission"", he'd have just said something different.",1
"I mean, it kind of make sense. Seems like black Adam will be drastically different from a tonal standpoint compared to Shazam. It's hard to imagine how exactly they will cross the two as I feel it will be more in line with the serious epic nature of something like Man of Steel. Not to mention Shazam was nothing special at the box office. If Black Adam is super successful, it would make sense to pair him with a much more iconic character. plus Cavill is also an absolute beefcake like The rock is. Won't look quite so awkward with them standing next to each other. Idk. I ""get"" it tbh. But it would be funky to not pair him with his actual nemesis. I feel the best they could is to have Shazam crossover with superman and have them both fight BA.",2
"Yeah, if he wants to be onscreen with Superman and doesn't give a shit about Shazam, why not be Lobo or something? Or one of many other big imposing DC antiheroes that I'm sure people could mention?",1
If that doesn‚Äôt work HE‚ÄôLL  DO A ROCKBOTTOM!!!!,2
Wrestlemania 32 was the beginning of the end for me. Thank God for AEW,0
"It‚Äôs pretty obvious that that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs referring to, she‚Äôs responding to someone asking if he appears in the first Black Adam film. And her response is that The Rock wants that for a sequel. Not that WB is planning it. I‚Äôm just saying if you‚Äôre going to respond to something, don‚Äôt blur the lines on what‚Äôs being said. We have too much wonky telephone game going on with these leaks. It‚Äôs probably BS, yeah.",0
Finally...finally....Fiiinally! Black Adam. Has come back! To Earth!,2
"Glad you're enjoying AEW. For me it's been massively disappointing. The product doesn't feel unique or fresh, as they led us to believe it would be. I find that NXT is better on a week to week basis. Also, the AEW PPVs haven't been as good as NXT Takeovers usually are. Just my opinion tho.",1
"The tweets from the screenshot don't make it clear that that is what she is referring to, imo. With the way she worded it. It seems like you are inferring things that she herself didn't specify well enough. If you interpret the tweet that way, then that's fine. I won't change your mind. So we'll have to agree to disagree.  Also, I'm the last person who wants to misconstrue or contribute to the wonky telephone game that gets played with these leaks trust me, lol.",0
"Agree to disagree, look how civil we are!",1
"It‚Äôs literally in the tweet she‚Äôs responding to. They ask with Black Adam filming soon, will Superman appear. She says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hearing that The Rock wants it but won‚Äôt happen until BA 2‚Äù. There‚Äôs no way to read anything else into it.",0
"The way she worded the tweet doesn't convey that. Sorry. Like I said, we'll have to agree to disagree.",1
"Well it‚Äôs not an opinion so there‚Äôs no reason to agree to disagree. But if you don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs clear cut, we‚Äôll just leave it at that. Grace is awful either way.",0
"It most definitely is an opinion. Her tweet could be interpreted as WB's side wanting Superman to show up in Black Adam 2, and the Rock wanting him to show up in one of his movies at some point (whether it be in a Black Adam film or one of the Shazam sequels). You are making a leap and believing that the first part of her statement  > I'm hearing that Superman wouldn't show up until Black Adam 2  is her talking about what the Rock wants, because of the rest of the tweet. That's completely fair for you to interpret it that way. But it is also completely fair to interpret it as the first part referring to WB, while the second part of the statement mentioning the Rock to be referring to what the Rock wants. The way she worded the tweet does not absolutely imply that she is talking about what the Rock wants, only. You seem to think that her wording leads to only your interpretation, but respectfully, it does not.  And as far as her being awful, I've never followed her on Twitter or YouTube, but the rumors and claims that people have posted from her seem to be very unreliable, in large part. That's why I called her a lower-level scooper. I'll take your word for it that she is awful, haha. A lot of what I have seen shared from her tweets or videos does seem awful.",1
I love how people still deny it exists despite the fact that literally everyone involved in it said it does...,3
"I used to be a denier, not that I thought the SC didnt exist but I was under the impression that it had unfinished vfx and no score, recent statements made me change my mind.  Just want to apologize to those people I argued with about that in here I am sorry.",3
"Olivia called Campea out on his crap earlier this year too. Campea was so adamant that the Snyder Cut ""doesn't exist...get over it"", and Oliva came out of nowhere with ""John, do us a favor and give it a rest. You're embarrassing yourself.""",3
"This is how much hatred lowers people. *Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox* was the universally revered DC animated movie that kicked off the current generation of feature-length DC animation (you know, the one branch of DC that's always been cool to like in the 2010s?). Oliva directed both that AND the acclaimed two-part animated adaptation of *The Dark Knight Returns.* In short, this man is the real deal, and an unsung hero of the DC fandom for setting the DC animated movie bar as high as it was in the last decade.  The moment Oliva went to bat for the Snyder Cut, he was denied, dismissed, and disowned by those aggressively positioned against the truth. From the way some treated him for his advocacy, you would believe they didn't know who he was.",3
"Why is it that people are so adamant about the Snyder cut not being finished or it doesn't exist or it won't be good. If you don't like Snyder fine, but whats the point of denying the cut if you don't have any investment in it",2
"Look, nobody believes that the movie is literally ""done"", as in 100% finished with complete VFX work and ready for release tomorrow. That would be far too unrealistic.   *However*, it is like 95% done. The cost to push it over the finish line would not be very significant. We kind of already knew this anyway thanks to leaked VFX footage that show there are *many* completed effects shots, along with some mostly-complete shots and a handful of less-than-complete shots. But they really got most of the legwork done during normal production.",2
Fandom Entertain meant is STILL in denial that it exists and is salty.,2
Wow. Jay pretty much roasted him.,2
Jay is a legend.,3
"Snyder literally said it's done a cut exists. He said this on video that is free to watch on line.  So at MOST, it needs some post-production VFX work. But the film is already shot, cut, and scored.",1
"I'm continuously dumbfounded by the amount of people stating that it ""doesn't exist"".  It's a cut of a movie not fucking loch ness.",2
"Jay Olivia is the best. Our man, through and through.   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut",3
Jay Oliva Strikes Again,3
"Do we know who‚Äôs doing the score for the Snyder Cut?   Please, tell me it‚Äôs Junkie XL or Hans Zimmer or both, or literally anyone other than the hack known as Danny Elfman.",2
That DC comics geek nation guy went on to call all Snyder Cut fans cult members then cry and play the victim card after Jay said it exists.,1
He‚Äôs so ridiculous.,0
"*Actor who starred in the movie says there is a cut and he's seen it.*  Jack from Kansas: *""lol no.""*",3
Was literally fighting people on /r/movies who are saying it doesn't exist and they're only saying it to hype fanboys up for HBO Max.,2
People have spent 2 years being brainwashed by character-assassinating bloggers. Might take a while to break the programming.  But I'm incredibly glad to be part of the majority now and not the minority.,3
"Much respect to you, buddy!",3
"Thank you for owning up to it and coming around! The tide is definitely turning, and I believe WB will #ReleaseTheSnyderCut on HBO Max. It is inevitable now at this point. If Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck, who are huge names, have publicly supported it, then WB is going to look bad if they don't follow through. Welcome to the movement!",3
No worries. Your apology is received well. Thank you for understanding.,2
In time they'll join you in the sun.,2
"Both the completion of the score and the advanced state of the VFX are more recent revelations. What has been known for over a year is that the film was shot and edited, with most of its major VFX sequences well into production. Those who denied all this completely revealed their existential opposition. If your position was based on the two specifics you cited, you were not one of them.",1
Much love,1
And let's not forget the biggest thing -- he was a storyboard artist for Justice League. I'm gonna take the word of a guy who actually *worked on the fucking thing* more than some random yahoo with a blog.,3
I always forget how many great movies Oliva has directed/worked on.,2
They can't let Snyder fans have anything. The worst part of all this is the current lineup of films doesn't contradict Snyder's original plan. If people hadn't complained we would almost be done and they could have their snyder free universe soon as well as the films that did release with the benefit of a flash film already filmed and cyborg and and Affleck Batman film. Superman would have good prospects for a sequel and there would be no division and WB would have made all the more money for it.,2
"Because if they're proven wrong, everyone will know they're just some dumbnut that repeats everything bloggers say and literally know next to nothing about film making and comic books.",1
"If it is 95%, WB are beyond idiots to spend millions of dollars on re-shoots, VFX changes etc;",1
Junkie XL confirmed that he had the score completed before Snyder's departure,2
Oh yeah he's so ridiculous because he's calling out ppl who have no idea what they're talking about. Give me a fucking break.,3
"How so?. What's ridiculous is people liking that cut of justice league we got, and in compltete denial that Zack made something better.",3
Campea or Oliva?,2
https://youtu.be/W4rtGPCsoXA,2
"The mods in some subreddits like /r/movies censor stories that spread news about the Snyder cut, so a lot of people are still ignorant in movie subreddits. Also, /r/DCcomics is known to ban people discussing ZS and /r/comicbookmovies mostly has Marvel movie discussions. I still hear people say ""Zack doesn't understand Watchmen"". Like bruh, he gave us the closest and most faithful adaptation we were ever gonna get, and yet people still repeat the same opinions that influencers told them are the cool and trendy default opinions to have. Even sarcastic stuff like ""Too bad they never made a sequel to the Matrix"" and disregarding any good parts.",2
Man the people who hang around r/movies have an irrational hate for Snyder. I don‚Äôt get it.,2
> I'm gonna take the word of a guy who actually _worked on the fucking thing_ more than some random yahoo with a blog.  Say it louder for the people in the back.,3
"At least we get an in universe reboot with Flashpoint. I get not liking Snyder and I get hating Snyder's more toxic fans, but actively trying to shit on a guy and his fans when you supposedly don't care for either is kind of dumb",2
"""It's not about the money. It's about sending a message.""  WB was desperate to recoup their multi-billion dollar cinematic universe after the negative reception to BvS, even though that was their own fault for editing the movie to the point of near-incomprehensibility. They would have spent any amount of money to ""fix"" Justice League, e.g. align the film's tone more closely with Marvel, and that's exactly what they did.",2
"Then why tf did they even hire Elfman to begin with- you know what? Forget it. I don‚Äôt care. I just want to here ‚ÄúMen Are Still Good‚Äù in a movie again. Not to mention ‚ÄúIs She With You?‚Äù and the MOS theme again, instead of ‚ÄúTHE Batman theme‚Äù and random bits of John Williams‚Äô Superman for some weird reason. Danny‚Äôs score for the theatrical cut of JL was terrible. Let‚Äôs hope Junkie did us proud.",2
"He‚Äôs not  calling out shit. He literally spend his days and hours going back and forth with fan accounts on Twitter, he‚Äôs RIDICULOUS. Deal with it.",0
Oliva,0
He means Campea.,0
I love that story,1
"Damn right, y'all. Damn right.",2
"Yeah, Elfman was brought just for 'NOSTALGIA SUPERMAN BATMAN THEME LOL' and make the film less 'Snydery', Hans and Junkie had composed such beautiful scores for MoS and BvS, that I know in my heart his JL score must be awesome. Elfman is a great composer, but he phoned it even with his Batman Theme, it feels so lifeless and generic, same for William's Superman Theme.",2
Lol ok boomer,3
"He's calling people out who chat shit. Do you not think it's even more ridiculous that people are constantly denying and slandering the idea of a Snyder cut, like they're not even trolling. Just childish little fanboys indifferent to storytelling which doesn't have shit jokes, ridiculous storylines and retarded patriotism, so yeah I'll happily deal with that. You sound like one of those butt hurt guys who he shut down immediately.",2
Example of why you shouldn't speak for someone else,2
"I hate the ‚Äúboomer‚Äù thing (just as I hate all attempts in the Internet age to make something ‚Äúa thing‚Äù). But yeah, this guy is a dick.",1
Lol John Campea is a joke. He's still denying that the Snyder cut exists. Why would the director of a fucking movie tweet out #ReleaseTheSnyderCut if it doesn't exist?,3
He‚Äôs a grown ass man with a full job that spend his day arguing with fans on Twitter just because they don‚Äôt worship at Snyder altar.,0
"Why? Campea is a douche?. Wow!, Is that you John???!.",0
"The internet is surely adept at making *things*. They‚Äôre just more widespread and less permanent.   I‚Äôve never seen someone pushing back against an Ok boomer comment go well for them. I‚Äôm not saying that it shouldn‚Äôt , but it‚Äôs just how the comment is designed.",2
"You think that's bad, you should see the crap Rian Johnson does.",1
"Yeah, that‚Äôs not even remotely correct.",1
Campea sucks but he was talking about Olivia and you took it upon yourself to answer the question for him. Speak for yourself and let others speak for themselves.,2
The ‚Äúok boomer‚Äù comment is like a instant RKO.  You can‚Äôt beat it or escape it.,1
"Well you got to give it to Rian, the movie he made is almost as despised by the GA as Snyder's BvS was. Zack may have made the right move by not engaging with toxic social networks, but you can't blame Johnson for at least trying to defend his movie by himself.  Why the JLSC crowd keeps repeating ""respect the artist's work"" yet spits at TLJ and on Rian Johnson is genuinely beyond me.",0
"Lol!, shuuuuut uuuup. My little wind up isn't going to change what he already said is it. He still gets his point across. It's one 'i' by the way for Jay 'Oliva'.",0
"Because Snyder never personally attacked people or stereotyped them for disliking his stuff.   Johnson subscribes to typical stereotypes like ""people didn't like it because they're afraid of strong woman"" and stuff like that. It's one thing to defend your movie by explaining what happened or why you disagree with the public on what they thought of it. It's another to act like ""no, you're the one who is at fault for disliking it.""",2
"All I'm saying is that there are better ways to seek attention then asserting yourself  in a conversation that you weren't apart of, answering a question that wasn't meant for you and hilariously answering the question wrong effectively making an ass of yourself.",2
"Well you can't deny that some of the most virulent critics of TLJ are genuinely sexist and let it transpire in their speech.   And even with them put aside, you have to agree that Johnson-haters are exceptionally repetitive and unrelenting in their tweets about him and his movie. 2 years after and the critics are still bashing him and TLJ to no end. God bless Snyder for his cool temper, but I'll be damned if I won't be allowed to vent about haters of my work.  Snyder is a soft, kind-hearted person, and he's cool-headed. Good for him. But other people are more hotheaded and defensive about their work. Because a director angrily reacts about people trashing him personally for doing a movie doesn't mean he's ""subscribing to typical stereotypes"".   And don't forget that a large part of the BvS fanbase was also following the ""no, you're the one at fault for disliking it"" for a long time, the comparisons with the pro-Snyder crowd are so blatant that I can't help but laugh at people who love one and loathe the other.",0
"Lol!, Christ! Do you not think I knew he meant Oliva'??!. I think you're trying to say 'thats not classy', well I don't know if you know this, but this isn't the Ritz.    Dude, do you understand what teasing or piss taking is? Or the fact that it didn't bother me that I looked immature to someone like yourself?, Can't be as much as that dumbass with his JO vendetta. Either you're taking the piss now, and succeeding, or you have no idea of what context is, even for a 3 word sentence.",0
"The sexist and racists who don't like TLJ are a tiny minority - kinda like the people who literally made fun of Snyder's daughter committing suicide because he made such ""awful"" movies. Classless people, but luckily a select few. Most people who didn't like TLJ just didn't like it for plot, character, editing, design, etc.   And no, I don't really agree because he seemingly incites a lot of his haters. It's one thing for a fanbase to be loud and obnoxious (I mean, let's be honest - how many fanbases aren't?), but it's another thing for a director to stoop to that level. It's like an adult trying to tackle children because they threw snowballs in his direction. It's degrading.   Like I said, it's one thing for him to explain to people why he did this or that... Plenty of filmmakers do that. It's another thing to make posts like ""mah diiiickkkk!!!"" (and yes, he did say that) and expect to still come off as blameless and mature. It comes off as a child throwing a tantrum because people didn't like his movie and it's hard to respect.",1
"Of course they are a tiny minority, thank god for that. But they are the loudest, most vocal minority, and they definitely have more visibility on social network (because they have nothing else to do, and because of the controversial nature of their speech), which guarantees counter-reactions from fans, and from online ppl in general.  But let's not pretend that people who made fun of Autumn's suicide were the only one mocking BvS online, the movie received *torrents* of undue criticisms, most of which also criticizing the plot, character, editing, design. And even without seeing abominations like aforementioned people, I can't recall the number of ""hack snyder"" posts, and people who generally describe him as the bane of the DC banner, and saying that BvS is literally the worst cbm to have ever been made. Yes, worse than Batman & Robin, worse than Catwoman, worse than Thor 2. And that's even after the UE was released. Unrelenting, as I said.  I liked TLJ (and I know I'll be downvoted to hell for that) but that's not the point, the point is that Johnson is much more relatable in that aspect. I defy anyone to produce an art work (of any kind - music, movie, painting...) , get trashed on a personal level for 2 YEARS by people watching it, and not lose your temper about it, not once. Yes it's like an adult trying to tackle children because every day for 2 years, these children wait in front of his door and throw snowballs at him with mean intentions. That kind of children needs to be scolded too, and the adult tackles them because it's the only language many of them understand.   The metaphor isn't even justified, because we're talking mostly about adults, some older than Rian Johnson, but most still behave like uneducated children. It's their fault, not his.",0
That‚Äôs some Nathan Drake shit right there quick turn the image and see if it unlocks the lost cut of Snyder. If not we may have to go to Tibet. Lol!,3
That‚Äôs actually pretty cool.,3
So guys this isnt fan work. This is the image shared by the stunt team in their video yesterday.   John arryn i think made this fit.,3
What's the second image overlaying on top?,2
"In case anyone was wondering, if you‚Äôre familiar with ‚ÄúAll The Gods‚Äù t shirt design that Zack released highlighting his Superman plan... then the image should stick out.   And now, with that Stunt video coming out, another image was revealed in that, of which I also captured.   When placing both images layered, they were almost identical with how everything was arraigned. And that is what you‚Äôre looking at above. üôÇ",2
Does anybody have HQ versions of these artworks?,1
"Anyone know where I can still get the t-shirt of Zacks equation, also his SnyderCon logo???. Many thanks in advance.",1
> Betwixt... Between     Oh my God... THE DCEU WAS KINGDOM HEARTS ALL ALONG. DARKSEID IS XEHANORT. JUSTICE LEAGUE 2.997 FINAL CHAPTER PROLOGUE NOW FOR PRE-ORDER.,1
What‚Äôs that image in between?,1
That lil' spermy.,1
"I‚Äôm not sure how mashing up two pictures, helps us make sense of what your getting at? We are confused here what are you implying?",0
So it‚Äôs fan art.,2
From the stunt team yesterday,2
Zack is doing some Illuminati shit! Follow the clues,2
Ink to the people has it. Just bought one a few days ago and it‚Äôs the real campaign. All proceeds go to suicide prevention charity.,1
"Think they still sell on the original website we bought them from.......     this site sells em, never bought off anything but the original site tho.   https://teemax.store/product/zack-snyder-all-the-gods-premium-t-shirt/",1
The point is that the stunt team of Justice League shared an image.  That image perfectly overlays over Snyder's image of the 5 part arc.  The second image helps you distinguish and break down the meaning of his 5 part arc.,2
I suppose layering them is. But two different images one from zack and one from his stunt team.   I doubt it is a coincidence it perfectly fits,2
"Thanks dude. Can't find the SnyderCon one. But will keep searching, cheers for the link.",1
Yea id check ink to the people.   Outside of that I would fogure out the name of those shirts.   Can prolly check snyders vero and google it because a bunch of people were making those shirts on the side,1
I hate the chinstrap it always looks dumb to me,3
Don‚Äôt cover up his beautiful chin üòî,3
No no no f*ck a chinstrap FOREVER,3
"Make his suit black/grey, blue/grey, yellow or no yellow, I don‚Äôt mind it but I‚Äôd seriously prefer no chin strap",2
I don't really like the chinstrap,2
"The chin strap is something that I think works in animation but believe would be terrible in live action. I'm just envisioning how stupid it would likely look every time her turns his head, just some folding, rippling rubber. Would make the suit look cheap, not authentic. Plus why would you cover Pattinson's chin. It's no Affleck, but the man has a great jawline going on.",1
I really like this!! Thumbs up!,1
Now THAT is something I can get behind. None of that blue/grey and yellow oval bat-symbol crap.,0
His chin will be visible as Mr. Wayne!,2
"They will race behind you.  They will stumble  They will fall.  But in time, they will join you in the sun, Kal.  In time,  You will help them accomplish wonders.",3
Straight cheesing with that dorky smile. :D   \#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,2
"I like how by the end of Justice League, Henry Cavill becomes the colorful and cheerful Superman we all know and love",1
"Dang, this is what we should have gotten in a Man of Steel sequel.",2
How‚Äôd you get the mustache off?,2
MOS was fantastic. I never cared for Superman before this movie. The Hans Zimmer music enhanced the experience a lot. Visuals were next level great.,3
Exactly the fcking same!,2
"Same here,mate. I went in hard on reading comics after watching Man of Steel.",1
"Considering how Superman is supposed to be the person that everyone should strive to be and his comics like to center around his humanity, I would love to see it in his movies. It doesn't have to be something as cliche as saving a car from a tree either. One of my favorite parts in All Star Superman was when he talked that girl out of killing herself by telling her that her therapist really was caught in traffic and then giving her a hug.",3
"*The Daily Planet criticizing those who think they're above the law is a little hypocritical, wouldn't you say?*   *Considering every time your hero saves a cat out of a tree, you write a puff piece editorial about an alien who, if he wanted to, could burn the whole place down. There wouldn't be a damn thing we could to stop it.*",3
Love the painted style. Who's the artist? I would  have loved to have seen things like this in an MoS2. Alas!,2
"The big boy scout thing was okay for the 50s, 60s and 70s, back when the Comic Code Authority was basically Nixon-ing its way through artistic creation.  But today, especially for a 80-year-old character, it feels bland and unimaginative. Superheroes in our day and age are defined by more than just being the holier-than-thou icon, it needs some measure of depth. And this is even more true for the OG superhero.",3
Then go watch the Donner Movies.,3
Do I miss seeing Superman saving a cat from a tree?  No.,2
"Superman being nice? Doing wholesome things? Warming your heart? Showing humanity in doing small acts of kindness as well as great ones? NO! HE SCOWLS NOW!!! LIKE A GROWN UP!!!  Honestly, this is why we can't have nice things, because people like the other commenters here are genuinely repulsed by them.",3
Even the real God doesn‚Äôt save cats from trees,2
"Not at all, you are not the only one.   I think if Chris Evans had been given really dark brown hair or light raven hair‚Ä¶   His Captain America, could have easily translated to being our beloved Big Boy Blue Superman that we know, love, and miss.  Imagine him saying, a line along the lines of: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like bullies, and I stand firm for the little guy (or gal).‚Äù  (Edit:) Cheers. üòÅüôèüèª",3
"Even though a lot of people say it would look corny, I really would like to see Clark doing relatively more mundane heroic acts like this. This is what I see when I think of Superman: a guy who even though he has so much power and could ignore what many call unimportant issues, is willing to step in and help someone in need because it's the right thing to do, even if it's as something as simple as getting a cat out of a tree.",1
This is kinda why I like the Whedon scenes in JL  Supes is actually in his prime and feels like he's finally become the hero he was destined to be.,1
"Nah not really, this kind of stuff is just corny. Only time I would like this in a recent movie is if its played for laughs. If its played with seriousness I'd roll the fuck out of my eyes. Imagine Iron Man or Wonder Woman or Black Panther unironically doing this stuff, it would look so cheesy and daft",2
Seems like a scene i would use to go to the bathroom on rewatches. Cuz that shits boring. And does nothing for me.   Idk how old yall are. But my Superman was never up in trees saving cats. He was too busy entertaining me on the page and on screen.,2
"Here's my problem with this: every moment there is someone being held at gunpoint or a serial Killer about to strike. Superman could stop that and save a human life. Or he could do something that a regular human could, like get a cat from a tree. I'd rather Superman use his precious time on problems of his caliber. Like stopping the world engine and saving a little girl a whole nation away from where he is.",2
"Go literally anywhere else in Superman media in film and television. There is nothing to miss since they never let us forget ""boyscout"" superman.",1
"I mean this is fine, but it‚Äôs going to seem corny to some and outdated to most. I thought Superman Returns did a good job of updating Boy Scout Superman, like when he saves the plane from crashing but then tells the passengers not to let it put them off to flying because it‚Äôs still the safest way to travel. That allows him to be cool while still being big blue.",1
No lol there's loads of people like yourself that want to see this on screen in an IMAX theatre.....  Edit: I am certainly not one of them. You want this guy in the justice league?. Really?. In fact let's see all the justice league go and save cats from trees. Get some imagination man. Leave that b.s at the Disney door.,2
I‚Äôd be fine if they made the next Superman movie very comic book accurate and a little campy like Aquaman with a couple scenes like this!,1
I do miss those moments tooüíñü•∞ü•∞üëçüèº LOCE HENRY -but miss those moments üòåüòâü•∞üíñ,1
I think that a hypothetical MoS2 should maybe open with a montage of Superman helping people like this kinda in a similar fashion to Spiderman homecoming where it shoes Spiderman stopping crimes and giving directions to people,1
Who is the artist? This looks sooo good!,1
"This comment section is so shit. Smarmy and obnoxious from both sides of this conversation. Snyder sycophants and haters both fucking suck. The movies were good.. they weren‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. We will hopefully have 3 movies of Snyder‚Äôs Superman if this HBOMax rumor comes to fruition. it is time for someone else to carry the torch. If they want to do this, fucking go for it!",1
"As much as Superman in JL gets shit on I think we got a peek at the pivot towards that kind of Superman. I could imagine a few of his lines from the final battle with Steppenwolf being said by DCAU Superman. And then the opening scene, which I don't think they got quite right, was a step in the right direction.",1
Yeah I miss it a bit. The recent Patrick Gleason run on Superman was filled a great balance of wholesome moments like this and serious stuff and it was honestly one of the best Superman runs in a while in the comics,0
"Most people do. But careful, cause most people in this sub like Superman to be edgy.",0
That would be perfect for adaption on the big screen. I want a Superman hero with heart and a lot smaller in scale. A personal story,2
"Honestly if people want to waste time watching superman getting a cat out of a tree, they need to just keep living in the past. 50 years in the past.",3
"Not everything needs to be dark and have a deep character arc. If there‚Äôs any superhero that should be pure and for the good of heart, it‚Äôs Superman. Like you said, he is THE superhero. A guy in bright red and blue spandex doesn‚Äôt need to be deep.",2
"I don't think they mean it cant also have depth. I also think the context of ""superheroes are different now"" works in favor of the boyscout thing. He can be old school and that's a noticeable trait. Not that everything as to be that way but people can enjoy it that way.",0
I don't know--the best modern Superman comics still manage to put these types of moments in otherwise bombastic and thematically rich stories.   I always thought BVS would have benefitted a lot from adapting the iconic All-Star Superman suicide jumper page as a quick vignette in its late first act/sometime in the second. It'd be a testament to Superman's character and also highlight the division between him and Batman.,2
"The fact that this apparently 'needs' to be emphasised and apparently 'needs' be in a version which suits you, means we can't have nice things like Snyder's vision.  I mean holy fuck, 'sorry guys we don't want to see Zacks epic tale and vision of supes and justice league - because we want to see him lift up a rock and save that bug, or grab the cat from the tree'... Wow. Can we not have both?. Can you not just watch your donner movies please. Superman deserves better.",0
God ain't like any human imagine. he is know what his doing. only human keep arguing which decision is correct way. he know what happen in future and past. God stated in A-Quran he knew every leaves that fall. he also closer to human more than we can imagine,1
Sorry but I don‚Äôt like Chris Evans üò•,0
i saw that as that people want to use superman as excuse to felt warm and comfort while he doing all the hard works,1
"By that same token, you wouldn't advocate Clark having a private and personal life at all? 24/7?  When he's having breakfast, he could be out saving the world in multiple places.",1
"I don't know why they hate you. I upvoted your comment, though.",1
"the one that edgy is you. next time, read your own comment.",0
'Boyscout' superman started with donner and maybe during the bronze age.Goldenage guy was legit vigilante.he had no qualms throwing a wifebeater through a wall.so you say go back 50 year or would mean less boyscout superman.the more you go back lesser he becomes.,1
Exactly. I didn't love bvs but fk me firemen save cats from trees too I don't need to see Cavill do this lmao grow the hell up,1
"Stuff like that still happens in comics to this day. So definitely not 50 years in the past. Also, that‚Äôs one of the main reasons Superman is as popular as he is today. That‚Äôs one of his traits. I know teenagers like things to be edgy, but you guys should first look at the character‚Äôs background before complaining.   And if people don‚Äôt like then can just go back on to watch the shitty Snyder‚Äôs movies with Superman or read / play the injustice series. Plenty of options.",0
This implies you can‚Äôt be a Boy Scout and have depth. It‚Äôs a tougher but to crack because earnestness is less cool than edgy-ness but I think there is a writer/director who can do it.,2
"He's not of this world, flies around in a cape with a tight ass costume and boots. I think you'll find explanations are required for this. People keep saying (complaining) MoS was dark.. how was it????.",2
It‚Äôs one of Superman‚Äôs main traits but ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get it out just to be edgy‚Äù. üôÑ,0
You know that's exactly what I'm saying? Can we not have both? And that's what OP was saying too. You got so caught up in trying to put me down that you didn't even realize we were all saying the same thing.  My complaint was not levied at the Snyder version of Superman but at the people in the comments of this post who are genuinely offended that Superman would ever be anything else.  You've put a great number of words in my mouth and I don't appreciate any of them.,2
"That‚Äôs cool and you don‚Äôt need to. We all have opinions and yours is just as valid as mine, and anyone else‚Äôs. Cheers goodly, OP. ü§îüòÅüôèüèª",2
"That's different. When he's already being Superman, he should be using his powers on the big problems. The murderers, the conspiracies, etc. He can't always be Superman, Clark is the true personality, and being Superman 24/7 would kill him emotionally. But when he is being Superman, he should face challenges worthy of Superman.",2
Eh it's just Snyder fans shitting on everyone's opinions.  It's like we're not allowed to want our own version of Superman. Only Snyder's Superman should be allowed to exist. Everyone who disagrees can go to hell.  This place has been this way since a long time. The recent push for the SC is just empowering such kind of behaviour even more.,1
As he should..,1
"This is the most ridiculous reply ever.  First, tries to assert only teenagers like realistic superhero films. Then goes on to call them ‚Äúshitty Snyder‚Äôs films‚Äù as if there‚Äôs no bias there. Real level-headed conversation. I‚Äôm sure Superman would approve.",3
I read the comics. Unless Bendis recently did this he does not at all save cats from trees.,2
"Mate, 'edgy'? Would be used as something unpopular. If you think superman saving a cat is popular, people will laugh at you. I'm unfortunately not a teenager anymore, and if I was I'd still like Zacks vision, because it has actual depth, without being blindsided with the most chessiest crap that belongs in the 50s. Please name me a recent series where superman does nothing but saves people from burning buildings and cats from trees?. If you people want that, go and watch your precious Reeves collection.",1
To add on to Connor's point All Star and whatever Happened to Truth and Justice are examples of how to do this right,1
Don't say Jar Jar Abram's. He ridiculed star wars with his tarded quips and overdose of bathos in high stakes situations.,0
I‚Äôm not talking about explanations I‚Äôm talking about the tone of the character.,0
"Snyder‚Äôs fanatics are very defensive these days, s√≥ is not surprise that he did.",2
"""i DoNt aPpreCiaTe aNy Of TheM"" you're not being obvious, infact you're obviously gunning for sarcasm against snyders interpretation. Don't play the victim here. So don't get offended when someone calls you out on crap like this. If what you're saying is exactly that, say it 'why can't there be both?' but you didnt. Don't just play a game of context and sarcasm twister. Plus saying Snyder doesn't have any of those things in his movie, is false, if you actually watch it.   If you want your heart warmed watch a Pixar movie. Superman isnt written to warm your heart. Unless you're talking atleast 30 years ago. He's an inspiration to some more so an admiration. The world is bigger than walking old ladies across the street. Which is the point of the modern relevant reiteration. People and the audiences need that element of escapism.",1
"did yo read recent comics, cap ain't like that anymore",1
"There's plenty of small scale stories that can be told and have been told by using Superman. And I'm not just talking about the 80s. Plenty of modern comics feature such moments as well.  Just a small wholesome moment in a movie doesn't necessarily imply that he's purposely letting millions of people die in terrorist attacks.  These are fictional stories featuring fictional characters. If the writer says that Superman helped a civilian with a small thing AND managed to reach a bigger problem without delay, then I don't see any reason to not believe him. We're talking about a guy who can fly and has super speed. Pretending that he is capable of managing such a feat isn't impossible or unrealistic.",1
"*Considering every time your hero saves a cat out of a tree, you write a puff piece editorial about an alien who, if he wanted to, could burn the whole place down. There  wouldn't be a damn thing we could to stop it.*",1
[He definitely does](https://i.redd.it/n3pq7cd0fhx31.jpg),1
And you obviously didn‚Äôt get the context of this whole post.,0
"You mean he ridiculed the franchise that gave us ""I don't like sand"", a pregnant woman ""dying of sadness"", and an intergalactic fascist regime defeated by teddy bears? Gotcha.",2
Here's a great example of how not to do superman. Have you seen titans and their version of Superboy??. That. anything related to acts with an attempt at indeerment is fucking ridiculous. It does not belong on a big screen. What tone??? There was nothing wrong with Snyder's 'tOnE'. Still waiting to hear why/how it was so dark. All because he didn't save a cat from a tree?. Smfdh.,0
Annnnnnd whos Superman is this? Because if its recent at all its Bendis. Or Tom king,1
"Good argument. But funnily enough that ones actually liked. The one I mean is, ""imma kill my dad for no reason"" and 'everytime characters in hot water >inserts unessescary quip<' oh and cannot orchestrate a modernised light saber battle to save his life. You know saga, that basically killed the jedi and the force off and we were left with the most lackluster and burnt out star wars since the prequels which everyone seems to praise now. Yeah, that one.",1
"Why do you keep talking about Snyder I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about what the guy said",2
Tom King,2
"I'm not gonna go into another tiring debate about the Sequel trilogy, but ... dude. ""imma kill my dad for no reason"" ? Really? Please tell me you're trolling.  The entire movie told us - and *showed us* \- that Kylo was completely brainwashed and manipulated by his master, the whole ""the Supreme Leader is wise"" schpiel just before is a clear reference to real-world teens being converted to terrorist ideologies and murdering their families in the name of these.  Hell, we had fucking Anakin Skywalker massacring children in the Jedi Temple the literal night after threatening to kill Palpatine for being a Sith lord.  &#x200B;  EDIT: My bad, should've understand you were trolling the second I saw ""cannot orchestrate a modernised light saber battle to save his life"". TFA's duel simply was amazing, it wasn't as overly choreographed as the Prequels, and not as clunky as the Originals. Not to mention that given the physical and emotional state of both combatants, the fight felt perfectly appropriate.",1
You just complained about tone and superman being dark... I'm asking how and why in your opinion. Why do you keep saying it needs 'cats being saved from trees' or something to that effect?.,1
Soooooo its for his non continuity run short series.   Soooo again our Superman is not doing this. Not in main continuity.   Tom king does a lot of this stuff in these books which if Im remembering correctly were just rereleased in one book after being a part of those Walmart big books.,1
"Okay - well that's terrible fucking parenting for that day and age. If you like Luke suckling on some alien cow titty (he might as well have been, I know he didn't actually).  All that about kylo doesn't fit man, plus then you've got this whole Rey is in it purely by chance with really unlikable John Boyega character.   Prequel stuff is far more entertaining and compelling. Ifthat was you're only argument to my points. I suggest we leave it here, you like it and think the prior stuffs crap - okay. I like the prior stuff - and this news stuff is complete crap to me. End of.   >The entire movie told us - and showed us - that Kylo was completely brainwashed and manipulated by his master, the whole ""the Supreme Leader is wise"" schpiel just before is a clear reference to real-world teens being converted to terrorist ideologies and murdering their families in the name of these.  How many of those do you know mate??. Happen alot where you are?. Because it's completely unrelatable, there still shows no reason. The trade federation had it going on man. You know it did!. Especially in comparison.  As for anikin I don't see a problem there??. That's story development for the jedi?. Makes sense to do that.  Edit: I'm fucking lol'ing at your love for that medieval sword battle. Jesus man if I wanted to watch swashbuckling I'd stream pirate sof the Carribbean or that 50,s  version of robin hood.",0
Obviously I'm not saying we.need an exact scene of him saving a cat from a tree by he needs to be more wholesome and positive. Superman should be a shining symbol of hope and positivity.,1
Why wouldn't they be in continuity? They don't seem to contradict the main titles. It's not out of character for Superman to do a small act of kindness like helping an old lady.,1
"I honestly don't see how he hasn't been. How is he not?. He saves everyone he can, all the time. Zacks done it. He does it because noone else can, and off his own back - Zack highlights this in his movies!. Id triumph story over meaningless side tasks and bathos any day of the week.",2
"Why?  BvS tackles this exact question. Why does he have to be what YOU want him to be? Why is his sacrifice not enough? He gives his body, sweat, blood, and LIFE, but because the guy‚Äôs not flashing a million-dollar smile and kissing babies, he‚Äôs not good enough? You getting this?",2
I dont know what to tell you man. It just isn‚Äôt in continuity.   Theyre just stories. Where the writer gets to do his own thing.,1
"Don‚Äôt worry. He‚Äôs mad because you simply shut his mouth with that photo.  Also, he‚Äôs not smart enough to realise that it isn‚Äôt just about saving a cat but about doings small things out of kindness.",2
Because literally what the character is. Happiness and hope. I can't believe there's people really arguing Superman shouldn't be hopeful and wholesome. This is what Snyder does to people.,1
"Pretty sure they're in continuity, Bendis' batman one is, there's no reason to think Kings isn't.",1
"No lol, he's not just that.",1
"So Superman is happiness and hope? Not sacrifice? Choice? The betterment of mankind? Resilience? Empathy and understanding?  No, you boil him down to two incredibly basic ideas with no depth. He‚Äôs here to service you. To give you hope and make you happy. And if he can‚Äôt do those things, he‚Äôs not Superman.",2
">In this all-new original story written by Brian Michael Bendis, Batman is pushed to his limit as he sets off in search of an item with the potential to destroy the universe as we know it! Batman isn't the only one looking for this item though. It's a race to the finish line with the fate of the universe hanging in the balance!  >The Riddler has stolen a priceless jeweled egg, and Batman is on his trail, chasing him from Gotham to Gorilla City and points beyond. But when Batman catches up with the crook, he realizes something is wrong with his old foe. The egg is possessed of some strange power that is scrambling Riddler's brain. The clue to what this is may lie in who hired Riddler to steal the egg: Vandal Savage. What does the immortal mastermind want with it? Batman's quest is like a tour of the DC Universe, spanning space and even time. Guest stars include Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Deathstroke, Jonah Hex and more!  >Brian Michael Bendis (Action Comics, Young Justice, Pearl) and Nick Derington (Doom Patrol) weave a tale that leads the Dark Knight on a wild-goose chase across the DC Universe, tracking down a mysterious artifact that contains the literal key to humanity's survival!   These are standalone stories that don't play into the main narrative.  BUt honestly my real point was that Superman Up Up and away from the Wal Mart big books are just side stories where the writer does things like this.  They aren't like you reading Superman Comics on the norm and within the pages you see him doing shit like saving cats and helping old ladies across the streets.  And you haven't seen anything like that definitely since before the New 52, and I really dont know the last time.  The comics don't go there cuz the shit is boring.    If it's on screen it isn't going to make the audience lose their shit or it be memorable.  It will just be a point for ""purists"" to say, now this guy gets Superman!  Got him doing mundane shit cuz he's the everyman hero.  But its really nothing an audience is going to find a top piece of the film or worthwhile.    Just a time filler.",1
All of those things come with happiness and hope.,1
">These are standalone stories that don't play into the main narrative.  For the most part no comic takes place into any main narrative outside of events, this book is part of main continuity and Bendis continues parts of it in his Young Justice Run.   King likely views it in the same way, it is in continuity. Superman does stuff like rescuing cats out of trees.   >They aren't like you reading Superman Comics on the norm and within the pages you see him doing shit like saving cats and helping old ladies across the streets.  He does do it, not super often because there are 80 years of superman comics and they don't need to do it all the time, but superman does stuff like rescuing a dog from a burning building, or finding the time to find a child's lost toys, because the small things are important too.  >The comics don't go there cuz the shit is boring.   The comics do go there, but again, it's not that frequent because it's been done alot and when you have a superman comic out every week, it doesn't need to be done all that often, but if you're claiming superman doesn't do smaller things in his main books, you're wrong.   >If it's on screen it isn't going to make the audience lose their shit or it be memorable.  If superman does more touching and personal things, it's going to help audiences form a bond with him.",1
"That‚Äôs not at all true. Being happy and hopeful in no way means you‚Äôre empathetic with others‚Äô situations, or that you‚Äôre willing to sacrifice your life for the betterment of the world.   I‚Äôm not saying hope should at all be dismissed, but to resign him to those two basic notions, especially something as subjective and empty as ‚Äúhappy,‚Äù is doing a severe injustice to the character. He inspires with his actions. And to do so he has to reflect the modern person so he can build trust. He reaffirms to people that being better isn‚Äôt just a Superman trait, but something everyone can accomplish. The further he gets from resembling the people the harder that is.",2

Superman does stuff like rescuing cats out of trees.  Yea man....... there is a distinct main continuity.  I don't think you understand.  All of those books that are the main titles with continued stories are the main continuity.   >He does do it, not super often because there are 80 years of superman comics and they don't need to do it all the time, but superman does stuff like rescuing a dog from a burning building, or finding the time to find a child's lost toys, because the small things are important too.

I am claiming that, and if I am wrong when was it last done?  >If superman does more touching and personal things, it's going to help audiences form a bond with him.  Sure it could be used for a quick nod to his relationship with people but that shit overall isn't going to help the movie.  People weren't going to love Man of Steel or BvS because they added him doing little tasks.  These things were in Superman Returns and people still didn't give the film a fair shake.",1
"Can't applaud enough, and that's exactly what I meant in my original comment.   Defining Superman by just being about ""happiness"" and ""hope"" is incredibly lazy, and in modern storytelling it's simply neither inspiring, nor interesting. At least not if you don't start by focusing on the *road* to those specific traits. In other words, focus on how he *became* a figure of hope, which means he has to start from a place where he's not that yet.  In other words exactly what Snyder was doing. He wasn't deconstructing Superman. He was *reconstructing* him.",2
"I‚Äôd prefer JL mainly because Superman Returns is still boring for me despite it being the more refined film obviously. At least with JL it feels like a fun watch and is a bit more engaging, both have flaws though.",3
"Personally I find JL more enjoyable. Superman Returns is a snore fest along with a creepo stalker Superman.       JL has more than one good scene, Henry as a more upbeat Superman(which is what I waited 3 movies for), and overall the cast just makes it more enjoyable. JL also has the upside of not being directed by Bryan Singer.",2
"I hated supes returns but that was just a movie. And to be honest superman was never my fav character so it didn't matter that much. Justice league... Man, I've been waiting for that shit all my live. Huuuge disappointment",3
"Say what you want about JL, it was at least mercifully briskly paced. Superman Returns, on the other hand, is like watching paint dry.",2
I can actually sit back and enjoy Superman Returns.,2
I'm more disappointed by Justice League but I would watch it over Superman Returns. Justice League is definitely bad but Superman Returns was just a dull snooze,2
"Superman Returns is definitely superior to Josstice League. At least it's a cohesive movie from one man's vision.  I think SR had a lot of potential that was squandered in terms of story execution and miscasting (Kate Bosworth, while she would have been fine as a ""young"" Lois Lane, was definitely not believable as an older Lois Lane who had been in a relationship with Superman and had a five-year old kid).  Making a semi-sequel to Superman II wasn't the issue. It was more so the fact that the story wasn't willing to risk fulfilling its own premise: What if Superman returned to a world that moved on without him? That answer is literally settled within 40 minutes of the film: The world instantly welcomes him back with open arms and the only ones who are salty about it are his ex-girlfriend and arch enemy. If the world actually reacted to Superman's return with indifference, uncertainty and even anger, then it would give Superman an interesting conflict to deal with.   Singer set up in interviews how Superman was returning to a Post-911 world, so something like that would be a dramatic question Superman would struggle with: ""Where were you when we needed you most?""   The very synopsis for SR prior to release set the story up as a ""redemption"" story and that just never came to fruition:   ""Following a mysterious absence of several years, the Man of Steel comes back to Earth in the epic action-adventure [***Superman Returns***](https://movieweb.com/movie/superman-returns/), a soaring new chapter in the saga of one of the world's most beloved superheroes. While an old enemy plots to render him powerless once and for all, Superman faces the heartbreaking realization that the woman he loves, Lois Lane, has moved on with her life. Or has she? Superman's bittersweet return challenges him to bridge the distance between them while finding a place in a society that has learned to survive without him. In an attempt to protect the world he loves from cataclysmic destruction, Superman embarks on an epic journey of redemption that takes him from the depths of the ocean to the far reaches of outer space.
